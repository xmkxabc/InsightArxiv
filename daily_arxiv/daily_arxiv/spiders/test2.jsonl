Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02294v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-03", "updated": "2025-07-03"}

To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed\nto generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying\nthe global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from\narbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably.

Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction\npipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose\nestimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an\nimplicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into\na personalized 3D heart model.\n  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the\nreconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume\nestimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\\% VS. 20.24\\%). In\naddition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important\nbreakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of\n5.75\\% ).

Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM.

However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability.

Our method encodes and\ndecodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When\ndecoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of\nobjects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head\nmotion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains\nthe legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,\nUCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all\nevaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or\nhigher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using\nRefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only\noutperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,\nacross all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02862v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-03", "updated": "2025-07-03"}

Despite proliferating\nresearch, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled\nsamples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,\nand suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on\nmulti-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,\nstatistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,\nthereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class\nimbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is\ndesigned, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through\nparallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.\nSimultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify\ncritical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor\ninteractions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to\nimprove the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive\nmulti-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic\nadjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results\non three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the\nproposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion\nnetwork (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,\nsignificantly outperforming existing approaches.

Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed.

To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.
