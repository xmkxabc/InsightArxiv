Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature\nMatching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across\nlayers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow\nfeatures through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to\nrefine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information.\nBuilt upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of\nshallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance.

Despite significant advances in video\nsynthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity\nof 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video\ngenerator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework\nautomatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a\ncompelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically\noperate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then\nwarping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting\nthe disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves\nspecular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity\nestimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts\nduring warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing\nthe new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by\nleveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,\noptics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually\ndisentangling geometry from the synthesis process.

Here we go\nbeyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object\ninteractions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point\ntracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare\ndistributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as\nmany as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos.

Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural\nnetwork performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced\nparameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric\ncombining performance consistency, generalization capability, and\nhyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking\nstandard across CGH configurations.

Nevertheless, their\nlimited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video\ncontent, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we\nintroduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video\nanalytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time\nconstruction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or\ncontinuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism\nthat leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive\nevaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that\nAVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,\nrespectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video\nanalytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new\nbenchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours\nin duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex\nquestion-answer pairs.

However,\nPT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific\nknowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL\nmethod built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task\nheterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes\nshared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,\navoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training\nlow-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention\nmechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank\ncomponents on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks\ndemonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and\nfew-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "TA-LoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5feb\u6162\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTA-LoRA\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5feb\u6162\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cTA-LoRA\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "TA-LoRA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Leveraging\nBayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,\nthe method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth\ncontours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\ncases needing correction.

For context, we also assess two\nlarge language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and\nF1-score serve as evaluation metrics.\n  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score\n(0.662), outperforming all other models.

Existing accident data collection is\nlargely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and\ninconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these\nchallenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping\ncode generation, news collection from online sources, accident news\nclassification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The\nsystem uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless\nautomation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,\ndynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts\nfor scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as\ndate, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and\npedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by\nremoving duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites\nover 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news\narticles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module\nachieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the\nhighest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed\nby Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning\n(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also\ndeveloped with usage instructions.

To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up\ntraining. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art\napproach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a\nfaster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid\nusage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant\nuse of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter\nefficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a\nparametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video\nrepresentation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework\nthat can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the\nspatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,\nNVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter\nefficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels\nat once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video\nquality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed\nincrease of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019\nimprovements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)\nand an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),\ncompared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,\nwe demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,\nHEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression.

This requires careful planning, often via magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these\nmodels is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical\nPlanning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate\ndevelopments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic\nsegmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a\ntraining phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,\nconsisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test\nphase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the\nteams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the\n95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity\n(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard\nconsisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score\n0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained\nnetwork called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results\nbetween diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs\nDice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical\nsegmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking\nteam used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of\nuse in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the\nhighest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in\nsmall, pre-treated tumors were insufficient. Therefore, more reliable\nsegmentation methods are needed to create clinically applicable models to aid\nsurgical planning in pediatric neuroblastoma.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPPIN\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624MRI\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edcSTU-Net\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0f\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u624b\u672f\u89c4\u5212\u4f9d\u8d56\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u7684MRI 3D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ec4\u7ec7SPPIN\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff08Dice\u3001HD95\u3001VS\u6307\u6807\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u56e2\u961fDice\u5f97\u52060.82\uff0cHD95\u4e3a7.69mm\uff0cVS\u4e3a0.91\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0f\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u624b\u672f\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation\nwith geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without\nhigh-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field\n(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain\nconsistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have\nutilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view\nconsensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that\nrelies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's\nimplicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,\nenabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.\nWe propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,\ninitialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are\ncorrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance\ndisambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure\nglobally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain\nhighly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a\nbalanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,\nScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and\nsemantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods\nand competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing\nthem when using additional 3D point clouds.

This solid joint distribution modeling is\nachieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,\nadaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,\nand the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy.

Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a\ncommon approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality\ncombination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for\nclinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling\npre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained\nmodel seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting\nrich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy\noutperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate\npre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training\nfrom scratch on several downstream tasks.

We expand upon existing research by conducting\ntwo survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine\nwhether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using\nLLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into\naccount both the \"receive\" and \"accept\" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller\n1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended\ninteractions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot\ninteractions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects\n(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced\ncontent). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct\npolitical domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual\ncampaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the\nreal-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact\nconditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we\nestimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \\$48-\\$74 per persuaded voter\ncompared to \\$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the\ncosts of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional\ncampaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and\nDecoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different\nmodalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant\nfeatures within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse\nSemantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian\ndescriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality\nalignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we\npropose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which\ndecomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related\ncomponents, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the\ntextual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter\nand the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian\nsemantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided\nFeature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information\nfor identification from the style-related features and restores it back into\nthe pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the\nfeatures after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with\nthat between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings.\nExtensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nour DSFAD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDSFAD\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VI-ReID\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u98ce\u683c\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u5149\u7167\u548c\u989c\u8272\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0cVI-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDSFAD\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542bDSFA\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53e5\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3001SMFD\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff09\u548cSCFR\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u6062\u590d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aVI-ReID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DSFAD\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DSFAD\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VI-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Delhi, being one\nof the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues\ndue to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which\nexacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution\nmitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail\nto maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability\nto dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths\nto improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,\nto iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple\nspatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic\npatterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is\nbenchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and\ngreedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation\nmetrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic\nimpact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based\napproach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective\ndistribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework\nachieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage\ndeployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions.

Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency\nadvantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static\napproaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in\ncomputational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests\nthat RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient\noptimization landscape for representation learning with significant\nimplications for resource constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9012\u5f52KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff08RKDO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5c40\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u635f\u5931\u503c\u964d\u4f4e30%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u51cf\u5c1160-80%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982I-Con\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u90bb\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRKDO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aKL\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u90bb\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRKDO\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u503c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea630%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u51cf\u5c1160-80%\u3002", "conclusion": "RKDO\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach\nmatches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based\nimplementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08proto-objects\uff09\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u53d6\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8662%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c2.6\u500d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, hyperspectral\nsuper-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral\ndimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples.\nMoreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of\nparameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which\nare often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet\narchitecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated\nconvolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges.\nSpecifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions,\nsimilar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated\nconvolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of\nboth spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss\nfunction that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm\nregularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the\npreservation of both spectral and spatial details.

Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through\nunsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like\nBERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have\nattempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative\nPLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that\nstate-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based\non generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient\nunsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To\naddress this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits\nthe structural characteristics of generative models.

Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for\nfunctional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging\nenables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial\nalternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,\nECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine\nMRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,\nparticularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel\nouter volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating\naliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.\nOur approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using\ncomposite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which\ninherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)\nmodel is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean\nouter volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding\nk-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL\n(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high\nspatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable\nto clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction\ntechniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach\nprovides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine\nMRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher\nacceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5916\u4f53\u79ef\u53bb\u9664\uff08OVR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6d88\u9664\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001MRI\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001MRI\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u6613\u53d7\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u9519\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5916\u4f53\u79ef\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u9664\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DL\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u91c7\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001MRI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This makes it challenging to assess if models\nare truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about\nvideos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic\nbiases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA\nfor modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer\nchoices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is\nmultimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of\ncomplex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset\nprovides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models.

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix.

By reframing memory systems through the\nlens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a\nstructured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools\nrelated to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based\nagents while outlining promising directions for future research\\footnote{The\npaper list, datasets, methods and tools are available at\n\\href{https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Survey_Memory_in_AI}{https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Survey\\_Memory\\_in\\_AI}.}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u5206\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u516d\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5de9\u56fa\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u538b\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3aAI\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Ablation studies further confirm the complementary\nbenefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u7597\u8bbe\u5907\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u8bbe\u5907\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523090.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c97.9% AUROC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0877.2%\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0854.8%\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,\nlargely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we\ninvestigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs\npre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,\nsuch as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring\nadditional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and\ndomain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation\nin different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available\nscientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves\nstate-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in\nP@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into\nthe strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for\nzero-shot learning and model adaptation.
