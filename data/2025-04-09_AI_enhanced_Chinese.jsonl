Typically, this\nis achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding\nnon-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i)\nEvaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM\nvocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global\ndistribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information,\neven if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm\nthat addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on\nthe full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive\nrejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer\nconstraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to\nproduce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small\nadditional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously\nproposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior\nof local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in\ntext-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON\ndomains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines,\nsupporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and\nperformance.

While large-scale synthetic datasets\nhave fueled promising learning-based approaches, their generalizability to\ndifferent domains is limited.

To bridge this gap, we propose GARF, a\ngeneralizable 3D reassembly framework for real-world fractures. GARF leverages\nfracture-aware pretraining to learn fracture features from individual\nfragments, with flow matching enabling precise 6-DoF alignments. At inference\ntime, we introduce one-step preassembly, improving robustness to unseen objects\nand varying numbers of fractures.

Although efforts have been made to restrict inference\nto specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only\ntrue guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and\ncompute-expensive proposition.\n  We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over\ncorpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for \"typical\" LLM\napproaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a\ntemporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two\ncorresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient\npretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.\n  We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned\nbaselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus.\nEmphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a\nnumber of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target\nfields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method\nenables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical\nchange, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense\nintroduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows\nextension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.", "AI": {"task": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u6587\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5386\u53f2\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u548c\u6587\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u6587\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u4f53\u88c1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8bba\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e94\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6bb5\u768410\u767e\u4e07\u8bcd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u7ec4\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLlama3-8B\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5c0a\u91cd\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6bb5\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u8bcd\u4e49\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4eba\u6587\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Lacking\nstructural awareness, these strategies may fail to consider a panoply of\nspatially inhomogeneous deformation properties, which would faithfully account\nfor the biomechanics of soft and hard tissues, especially in poorly contrasted\nstructures.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a learning-based image registration approach\nin which the inferred deformation properties can locally adapt themselves to\ntrained biomechanical characteristics. Specifically, we first enforce in the\ntraining process local rigid displacements, shearing motions or pseudo-elastic\ndeformations using regularization losses inspired from the field of\nsolid-mechanics. We then show on synthetic and real 3D thoracic and abdominal\nimages that these mechanical properties of different nature are well\ngeneralized when inferring the deformations between new image pairs. Our\napproach enables neural-networks to infer tissue-specific deformation patterns\ndirectly from input images, ensuring mechanically plausible motion.

However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited\nby small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation.\nAdditionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response\nlabeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets.\nTo address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset\nannotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and\ncarefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream\nLLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we\nintroduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a\nhigh-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese\npreference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel,\nand Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for\nscoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously\nconstructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on\nAlignBench \\citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that\nCOIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it\nbrings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the\nQwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively.

Yet,\nit remains unclear whether LLMs can replicate the adaptivity of intelligent\ntutoring systems (ITS)--where student knowledge and pedagogical strategies are\nexplicitly modeled. We propose a prompt variation framework to assess\nLLM-generated instructional moves' adaptivity and pedagogical soundness across\n75 real-world tutoring scenarios from an ITS. We systematically remove key\ncontext components (e.g., student errors and knowledge components) from prompts\nto create variations of each scenario. Three representative LLMs (Llama3-8B,\nLlama3-70B, and GPT-4o) generate 1,350 instructional moves. We use text\nembeddings and randomization tests to measure how the omission of each context\nfeature impacts the LLMs' outputs (adaptivity) and a validated tutor-training\nclassifier to evaluate response quality (pedagogical soundness). Surprisingly,\neven the best-performing model only marginally mimics the adaptivity of ITS.\nSpecifically, Llama3-70B demonstrates statistically significant adaptivity to\nstudent errors. Although Llama3-8B's recommendations receive higher pedagogical\nsoundness scores than the other models, it struggles with instruction-following\nbehaviors, including output formatting. By contrast, GPT-4o reliably adheres to\ninstructions but tends to provide overly direct feedback that diverges from\neffective tutoring, prompting learners with open-ended questions to gauge\nknowledge. Given these results, we discuss how current LLM-based tutoring is\nunlikely to produce learning benefits rivaling known-to-be-effective ITS\ntutoring.

Recently, a field called dynamic scene video has emerged,\nwhich combines single image animation with 3D photography. These methods use\npseudo 3D space, implicitly represented with Layered Depth Images (LDIs). LDIs\nseparate a single image into depth-based layers, which enables elements like\nwater and clouds to move within the image while revealing new scenes from\ndifferent camera perspectives. However, as landscapes typically consist of\ncontinuous elements, including fluids, the representation of a 3D space\nseparates a landscape image into discrete layers, and it can lead to diminished\ndepth perception and potential distortions depending on camera movement.\nFurthermore, due to its implicit modeling of 3D space, the output may be\nlimited to videos in the 2D domain, potentially reducing their versatility. In\nthis paper, we propose representing a complete 3D space for dynamic scene video\nby modeling explicit representations, specifically 4D Gaussians, from a single\nimage. The framework is focused on optimizing 3D Gaussians by generating\nmulti-view images from a single image and creating 3D motion to optimize 4D\nGaussians. The most important part of proposed framework is consistent 3D\nmotion estimation, which estimates common motion among multi-view images to\nbring the motion in 3D space closer to actual motions. As far as we know, this\nis the first attempt that considers animation while representing a complete 3D\nspace from a single landscape image.

We further analyze the affinity\nof these features and observe a strong correlation with point correspondences.\nThrough extensive experiments on DAVIS-17 and MOSE, we find that diffusion\nmodels trained on ImageNet outperform those trained on larger, more diverse\ndatasets for ZS-VOS. Additionally, we highlight the importance of point\ncorrespondences in achieving high segmentation accuracy, and we yield\nstate-of-the-art results in ZS-VOS.

However, existing approaches primarily emphasize\nthe representation of such features while neglecting their precise\nlocalization, which often leads to misclassification caused by shortcut biases.\nThis limitation becomes even more pronounced when models are evaluated on\ntransfer or out-of-distribution datasets. In contrast, humans are capable of\nleveraging prior object knowledge to quickly localize and compare fine-grained\nattributes, a capability that is especially crucial in complex and\nhigh-variance classification scenarios.

In this work, we introduce UnifyEdit, a\ntuning-free method that performs diffusion latent optimization to enable a\nbalanced integration of fidelity and editability within a unified framework.\nUnlike direct attention injections, we develop two attention-based constraints:\na self-attention (SA) preservation constraint for structural fidelity, and a\ncross-attention (CA) alignment constraint to enhance text alignment for\nimproved editability.

Modern graph-cut based approaches rely on high-dimensional\nattention maps from Transformer-based foundation models, typically employing a\nrelaxed Normalized Cut solved recursively via the Fiedler vector (the\neigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue). Consequently, they still lag\nbehind supervised methods in both mask generation speed and segmentation\naccuracy. We present a regularized fractional alternating cut (Falcon), an\noptimization-based K-way Normalized Cut without relying on recursive\neigenvector computations, achieving substantially improved speed and accuracy.\nFalcon operates in two stages: (1) a fast K-way Normalized Cut solved by\nextending into a fractional quadratic transformation, with an alternating\niterative procedure and regularization to avoid local minima; and (2)\nrefinement of the resulting masks using complementary low-level information,\nproducing high-quality pixel-level segmentations. Experiments show that Falcon\nnot only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.5%\nacross six widely recognized benchmarks (reaching up to 4.3\\% improvement on\nCityscapes), but also reduces runtime by around 30% compared to prior\ngraph-based approaches.

To address these challenges, we propose an approach named iEBAKER (an\nImproved Eliminate Before Align strategy with Keyword Explicit Reasoning\nframework) for RSITR.

This paper explores the unique advantage of Frequency\nModulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR in autonomous perception. Given a single\nframe FMCW point cloud with radial velocity measurements, we expect that our\nobject detector can detect the short-term future locations of objects using\nonly the current frame sensor data and demonstrate a fast ability to respond to\nintermediate danger. To achieve this, we extend the standard object detection\ntask to a novel task named predictive object detection (POD), which aims to\npredict the short-term future location and dimensions of objects based solely\non current observations. Typically, a motion prediction task requires\nhistorical sensor information to process the temporal contexts of each object,\nwhile our detector's avoidance of multi-frame historical information enables a\nmuch faster response time to potential dangers. The core advantage of FMCW\nLiDAR lies in the radial velocity associated with every reflected point. We\npropose a novel POD framework, the core idea of which is to generate a virtual\nfuture point using a ray casting mechanism, create virtual two-frame point\nclouds with the current and virtual future frames, and encode these two-frame\nvoxel features with a sparse 4D encoder. Subsequently, the 4D voxel features\nare separated by temporal indices and remapped into two Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nfeatures: one decoded for standard current frame object detection and the other\nfor future predictive object detection.

However, traditional frame-based cameras, widely\nused in UAV-based inspections, often struggle to capture defects under low or\ndynamic lighting conditions. In contrast, Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), or\nevent-based cameras, excel in such scenarios by minimizing motion blur,\nenhancing power efficiency, and maintaining high-quality imaging across diverse\nlighting conditions without saturation or information loss. Despite these\nadvantages, existing research lacks studies exploring the feasibility of using\nDVS for detecting civil structural defects.Moreover, there is no dedicated\nevent-based dataset tailored for this purpose. Addressing this gap, this study\nintroduces the first event-based civil infrastructure defect detection dataset,\ncapturing defective surfaces as a spatio-temporal event stream using DVS.In\naddition to event-based data, the dataset includes grayscale intensity image\nframes captured simultaneously using an Active Pixel Sensor (APS). Both data\ntypes were collected using the DAVIS346 camera, which integrates DVS and APS\nsensors.The dataset focuses on two types of defects: cracks and spalling, and\nincludes data from both field and laboratory environments. The field dataset\ncomprises 318 recording sequences,documenting 458 distinct cracks and 121\ndistinct spalling instances.The laboratory dataset includes 362 recording\nsequences, covering 220 distinct cracks and 308 spalling instances.Four\nrealtime object detection models were evaluated on it to validate the dataset\neffectiveness.The results demonstrate the dataset robustness in enabling\naccurate defect detection and classification,even under challenging lighting\nconditions.", "AI": {"task": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08DVS\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c11\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800cDVS\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u4e86DVS\u548cAPS\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684DAVIS346\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u91c7\u96c6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7070\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u88c2\u7f1d\u548c\u5265\u843d\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b318\u4e2a\u73b0\u573a\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e8f\u5217\u548c362\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite\nstrong performance on standard action recognition benchmarks, video\nself-supervised learning methods are largely evaluated under narrow protocols,\ntypically pretraining on Kinetics-400 and fine-tuning on similar datasets,\nlimiting our understanding of their generalization in real world scenarios. In\nthis work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of modern video\nself-supervised models, focusing on generalization across four key downstream\nfactors: domain shift, sample efficiency, action granularity, and task\ndiversity. Building on our prior work analyzing benchmark sensitivity in\nCNN-based contrastive learning, we extend the study to cover state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based video-only and video-text models. Specifically, we benchmark\n12 transformer-based methods (7 video-only, 5 video-text) and compare them to\n10 CNN-based methods, totaling over 1100 experiments across 8 datasets and 7\ndownstream tasks. Our analysis shows that, despite architectural advances,\ntransformer-based models remain sensitive to downstream conditions.

In this work, we\nconceptualize this effect as the $\\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which\nquantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that\ncomply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data\ncompliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual\npretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where\ncopyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments\nwith 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data\nopt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\\% DCG).\nHowever, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major\npublishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open\ndata, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to\nhigh-quality copyrighted sources later in training.

However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target\ndomains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution\nshifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention\nmechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to\nkey objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture,\nscale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain\nadaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with\ndynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in\ntransferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask\nTransformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic\nsegmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial\ntransferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive\nCluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images\ninto structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized\ntransferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA)\nmodule that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs'\nattention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low\ntransferability and high semantic uncertainty.

The hybrid module incorporates query\nexpansion and combines the results of sparse and dense retrievers through a\ndynamically weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion score.

The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for\ncapturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module\nidentifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes\nwithin the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these\ntemporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual\nunderstanding and response accuracy.

While useful for\nsingle subjects, we find that it struggles when scaling to multiple characters.\nIn this work, we first analyze the reason for these limitations. Our\nexploration reveals that the primary-issue stems from self-attention-leakage,\nwhich is exacerbated when trying to ensure consistency across\nmultiple-characters.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance\ndomain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences\nwhen users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized\nguidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor\npersonality to build relationships and foster trust.

To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite\nof efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic\nproperty prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike\ntask-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources,\nenabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The\nsuite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a\ncomprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases,\nand cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved\nsuperior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on\n64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50\n(superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks,\nsuch as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data\nthan fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited\napplications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features\nconversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized\nproperty predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language,\nprovide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and\nengage in scientific discussions.

Mainstream motion-appearance approaches\nuse either the two-encoder structure to separately encode motion and appearance\nfeatures, or the single-encoder structure for joint encoding. However, these\nmethods fail to properly balance the motion-appearance relationship.\nConsequently, even with complex fusion modules for motion-appearance\nintegration, the extracted suboptimal features degrade the models' overall\nperformance. Moreover, the quality of optical flow varies across scenarios,\nmaking it insufficient to rely solely on optical flow to achieve high-quality\nsegmentation results. To address these challenges, we propose the Intrinsic\nSaliency guided Trunk-Collateral Net}work (ISTC-Net), which better balances the\nmotion-appearance relationship and incorporates model's intrinsic saliency\ninformation to enhance segmentation performance.

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks\nmay not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their\napplicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy\nfor the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's partial progress\nin the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild!

To support fact-checkers, researchers have been focusing on\ncreating datasets and developing methods for multimodal misinformation\ndetection (MMD).

Although some recent\nattempts have explored such compositional scenarios, they still require an\nextensive process of optimizing the entire layout, which is highly cumbersome\nif not infeasible at all. To overcome these challenges, we propose Flash\nSculptor in this paper, a simple yet effective framework for compositional 3D\nscene/object reconstruction from a single image. At the heart of Flash Sculptor\nlies a divide-and-conquer strategy, which decouples compositional scene\nreconstruction into a sequence of sub-tasks, including handling the appearance,\nrotation, scale, and translation of each individual instance.

To potentially aid their efforts, multiple lesion\ndetection algorithms have been developed with a large public dataset called\nDeepLesion (32,735 lesions, 32,120 CT slices, 10,594 studies, 4,427 patients, 8\nbody part labels). However, this dataset contains missing measurements and\nlesion tags, and exhibits a severe imbalance in the number of lesions per label\ncategory. In this work, we utilize a limited subset of DeepLesion (6\\%, 1331\nlesions, 1309 slices) containing lesion annotations and body part label tags to\ntrain a VFNet model to detect lesions and tag them. We address the class\nimbalance by conducting three experiments: 1) Balancing data by the body part\nlabels, 2) Balancing data by the number of lesions per patient, and 3)\nBalancing data by the lesion size. In contrast to a randomly sampled\n(unbalanced) data subset, our results indicated that balancing the body part\nlabels always increased sensitivity for lesions >= 1cm for classes with low\ndata quantities (Bone: 80\\% vs. 46\\%, Kidney: 77\\% vs. 61\\%, Soft Tissue: 70\\%\nvs. 60\\%, Pelvis: 83\\% vs. 76\\%). Similar trends were seen for three other\nmodels tested (FasterRCNN, RetinaNet, FoveaBox).

However,\nDP-SGD, which directly perturbs gradients in the training iterations, fails to\nmitigate the negative impacts of noise on gradient direction. As a result,\nDP-SGD is often inefficient. Although various solutions (e.g., clipping to\nreduce the sensitivity of gradients and amplifying privacy bounds to save\nprivacy budgets) are proposed to trade privacy for model efficiency, the root\ncause of its inefficiency is yet unveiled.\n  In this work, we first generalize DP-SGD and theoretically derive the impact\nof DP noise on the training process. Our analysis reveals that, in terms of a\nperturbed gradient, only the noise on direction has eminent impact on the model\nefficiency while that on magnitude can be mitigated by optimization techniques,\ni.e., fine-tuning gradient clipping and learning rate. Besides, we confirm that\ntraditional DP introduces biased noise on the direction when adding unbiased\nnoise to the gradient itself. Overall, the perturbation of DP-SGD is actually\nsub-optimal from a geometric perspective. Motivated by this, we design a\ngeometric perturbation strategy GeoDP within the DP framework, which perturbs\nthe direction and the magnitude of a gradient, respectively. By directly\nreducing the noise on the direction, GeoDP mitigates the negative impact of DP\nnoise on model efficiency with the same DP guarantee.

Evaluating SDOH-related\nphenotypes using routine medical images as data sources may enhance health\ndisparities research. We developed a pipeline for using quantitative measures\nautomatically extracted from medical images as inputs into health disparities\nindex calculations. Our study focused on the use case of two SDOH demographic\ncorrelates (sex and race) and data extracted from chest radiographs of 1,571\nunique patients. The likelihood of severe disease within the lung parenchyma\nfrom each image type, measured using an established deep learning model, was\nmerged into a single numerical image-based phenotype for each patient. Patients\nwere then separated into phenogroups by unsupervised clustering of the\nimage-based phenotypes.

However, current methods often fail to\nextract modality-invariant features when aligning image pairs with large\nnonlinear radiometric differences. To address this issues, we propose\nOSDM-MReg, a novel multimodal image registration framework based image-to-image\ntranslation to eliminate the gap of multimodal images. Firstly, we propose a\nnovel one-step unaligned target-guided conditional denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models(UTGOS-CDDPM)to translate multimodal images into a unified\ndomain. In the inference stage, traditional conditional DDPM generate\ntranslated source image by a large number of iterations, which severely slows\ndown the image registration task. To address this issues, we use the unaligned\ntraget image as a condition to promote the generation of low-frequency features\nof the translated source image. Furthermore, during the training stage, we add\nthe inverse process of directly predicting the translated image to ensure that\nthe translated source image can be generated in one step during the testing\nstage. Additionally, to supervised the detail features of translated source\nimage, we propose a new perceptual loss that focuses on the high-frequency\nfeature differences between the translated and ground-truth images. Finally, a\nmultimodal multiscale image registration network (MM-Reg) fuse the multimodal\nfeature of the unimodal images and multimodal images by proposed multimodal\nfeature fusion strategy.
