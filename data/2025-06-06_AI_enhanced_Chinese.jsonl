VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample\nreplay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each\ntask is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be\nable to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and\nhighlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task\nsubspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting\ncan be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present\ntasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also\nin distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases\nforgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay\nis not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a\nneural networks equipped with SGD.

The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are\nevaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining\nthe equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of\ntrue interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their\nintegral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A\nmeticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of\ninteracting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better\ntraction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nmethod are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch\ntest, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the\ncapability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and\nsharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch\ntest with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy\nlevels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with\nmesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested\nfor self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.\nDynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as\noblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the\nalgorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal\nmeshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact\nproblems.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出了一种无偏接触交互方法，验证了其在多种接触问题上的准确性和鲁棒性。", "motivation": "为了无偏处理接触表面，避免将表面指定为主从表面。", "method": "提出了一种基于惩罚实际互穿和积分离散接触段的方法，用于评估接触段之间的接触张力。", "result": "该方法能够以高精度处理平面、曲面和尖角之间的接触，并验证了其在自接触问题和动态碰撞问题上的有效性。", "conclusion": "提出了一种接触交互方法，用于无偏处理接触表面，并通过与解析解的对比验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。"}}
