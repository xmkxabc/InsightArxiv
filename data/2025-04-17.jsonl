Experimental results\ndemonstrate that certain configurations, particularly those using valid-padded\nshared convolutions, can successfully learn attention, achieving comparable\nattention scores to those obtained with standard ViTs. However, other\nconfigurations, such as those using same-padded convolutions, show limitations\nin attention learning and operate like regular CNNs rather than transformer\nmodels. ConvShareViT architectures are specifically optimised for the 4f\noptical system, which takes advantage of the parallelism and high-resolution\ncapabilities of optical systems. Results demonstrate that ConvShareViT can\ntheoretically achieve up to 3.04 times faster inference than GPU-based systems.\nThis potential acceleration makes ConvShareViT an attractive candidate for\nfuture optical deep learning applications and proves that our ViT\n(ConvShareViT) can be employed using only the convolution operation, via the\nnecessary optimisation of the ViT to balance performance and complexity."}

SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of\nlearned directions, or \"concepts\". We find that, compared to other methods of\nlinear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,\nwhile also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different\nseeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts\ncaptured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that\nthe key commonly-activating concepts extracted by SAEs are remarkably stable\nacross runs. Interestingly, while most concepts are strongly unimodal in\nactivation, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many lie\nclose to - but not entirely within - the subspace defining modality, suggesting\nthat they encode cross-modal semantics despite their unimodal usage. To\nquantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that\nidentifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text\ninputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space.

This study tests the\nhypothesis that subtle changes in the structure of prompts do not produce\nsignificant variations in the classification results of sentiment polarity\nanalysis generated by the Large Language Model GPT-4o mini. Using a dataset of\n100.000 comments in Spanish on four Latin American presidents, the model\nclassified the comments as positive, negative, or neutral on 10 occasions,\nvarying the prompts slightly each time. The experimental methodology included\nexploratory and confirmatory analyses to identify significant discrepancies\namong classifications.\n  The results reveal that even minor modifications to prompts such as lexical,\nsyntactic, or modal changes, or even their lack of structure impact the\nclassifications. In certain cases, the model produced inconsistent responses,\nsuch as mixing categories, providing unsolicited explanations, or using\nlanguages other than Spanish. Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests\nconfirmed significant differences in most comparisons between prompts, except\nin one case where linguistic structures were highly similar.\n  These findings challenge the robustness and trust of Large Language Models\nfor classification tasks, highlighting their vulnerability to variations in\ninstructions.

However, current studies are hindered by steep computational costs\ndue to the high-dimensional property of HSI and dense sampling-based training\nparadigm, constraining their rapid deployment. Our key observation is that,\nduring training, not all samples within the same homogeneous area are\nindispensable, whereas ingenious sampling can provide a powerful substitute for\nreducing costs. Motivated by this, we propose an Asymmetrical Consensus State\nSpace Model (ACMamba) to significantly reduce computational costs without\ncompromising accuracy. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical anomaly\ndetection paradigm that utilizes region-level instances as an efficient\nalternative to dense pixel-level samples. In this paradigm, a low-cost\nMamba-based module is introduced to discover global contextual attributes of\nregions that are essential for HSI reconstruction.

We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves\nbeyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively.\nInstead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion\nsignatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal\nmotion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve\nnatural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while\nremaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also\nrequires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature\ndetection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it\noutperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional\napproaches fail. By leveraging motion rather than appearance, Flow Intelligence\nenables robust, real-time video feature matching in diverse environments."}

The Appendix is provided additionally", "summary": "Visual relation detection (VRD) aims to identify relationships (or\ninteractions) between object pairs in an image. Although recent VRD models have\nachieved impressive performance, they are all restricted to pre-defined\nrelation categories, while failing to consider the semantic ambiguity\ncharacteristic of visual relations. Unlike objects, the appearance of visual\nrelations is always subtle and can be described by multiple predicate words\nfrom different perspectives, e.g., ``ride'' can be depicted as ``race'' and\n``sit on'', from the sports and spatial position views, respectively. To this\nend, we propose to model visual relations as continuous embeddings, and design\ndiffusion models to achieve generalized VRD in a conditional generative manner,\ntermed Diff-VRD. We model the diffusion process in a latent space and generate\nall possible relations in the image as an embedding sequence. During the\ngeneration, the visual and text embeddings of subject-object pairs serve as\nconditional signals and are injected via cross-attention. After the generation,\nwe design a subsequent matching stage to assign the relation words to\nsubject-object pairs by considering their semantic similarities. Benefiting\nfrom the diffusion-based generative process, our Diff-VRD is able to generate\nvisual relations beyond the pre-defined category labels of datasets. To\nproperly evaluate this generalized VRD task, we introduce two evaluation\nmetrics, i.e., text-to-image retrieval and SPICE PR Curve inspired by image\ncaptioning. Extensive experiments in both human-object interaction (HOI)\ndetection and scene graph generation (SGG) benchmarks attest to the superiority\nand effectiveness of Diff-VRD."}

In this paper, we\nintroduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation\nmethod that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales. Our approach leverages\nan anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to\nseparate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field\ndepth and tapered far-field depth. The anchor acts as a normalization factor,\nenabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while\nmapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero. Through this approach, any depth\nfrom zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified\nrepresentation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene\nscale variations. More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide\nalong the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales. A\nsmaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth\nprecision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in\nfar regions. This adaptability enables the model to handle depth predictions at\nvarying distances and ensure strong generalization across datasets.

One key landscape feature that\nindicates intense herbivore activity and potentially impacts biodiversity is\nthe formation of grazing trails. Grazing trails are formed by the continuous\ntrampling activity of large herbivores that can produce complex networks of\ntracks of bare soil.

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical\npractice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification\n(WSWC).

SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder\narchitecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct\nimages using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key\ninnovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an\nencoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since\nthe green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared\nto red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is\ndesigned to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the\ngeneralization ability of the model, a self-supervised moir\\'e image generation\nmethod has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing\nmethods in processing real moir\\'e pattern data, showing its superior\ngeneralization performance and robustness."}

Online source-free\nuniversal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing\nmethods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship\nbetween pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To\nbridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled\nexperiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into\npseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap\nbetween the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved\nwith perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables\neffective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a\ncross-entropy loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves\nsuperior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection.
