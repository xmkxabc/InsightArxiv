To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel framework that enables small object representations to \"borrow\"\ndiscriminative features from larger, semantically richer instances within the\nsame class. Our architecture introduces three key components: the Feature\nMatching Block (FMB) to identify semantically similar descriptors across\nlayers, the Feature Representing Block (FRB) to generate enhanced shallow\nfeatures through weighted aggregation, and the Feature Fusion Block (FFB) to\nrefine feature maps by integrating original, borrowed, and context information.\nBuilt upon the SSD framework, our method improves the descriptive capacity of\nshallow layers while maintaining real-time detection performance.

Despite significant advances in video\nsynthesis, creating 3D videos remains challenging due to the relative scarcity\nof 3D video data. We propose a simple approach for transforming a text-to-video\ngenerator into a video-to-stereo generator. Given an input video, our framework\nautomatically produces the video frames from a shifted viewpoint, enabling a\ncompelling 3D effect. Prior and concurrent approaches for this task typically\noperate in multiple phases, first estimating video disparity or depth, then\nwarping the video accordingly to produce a second view, and finally inpainting\nthe disoccluded regions. This approach inherently fails when the scene involves\nspecular surfaces or transparent objects. In such cases, single-layer disparity\nestimation is insufficient, resulting in artifacts and incorrect pixel shifts\nduring warping. Our work bypasses these restrictions by directly synthesizing\nthe new viewpoint, avoiding any intermediate steps. This is achieved by\nleveraging a pre-trained video model's priors on geometry, object materials,\noptics, and semantics, without relying on external geometry models or manually\ndisentangling geometry from the synthesis process.

We\nemploy a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)\nmedication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to\nfine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a\ndetailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and\nambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual\nfeatures, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water\nintake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in\ncaptions.

Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty.

These challenges include\nhandling diverse vehicle attributes, occlusions, illumination variations,\nshadows, and varying video resolutions. To address these issues, we propose an\nefficient and cost-effective deep learning-based framework for Multi-Object\nMulti-Camera Tracking (MO-MCT).

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and\nDecoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different\nmodalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant\nfeatures within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse\nSemantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian\ndescriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality\nalignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we\npropose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which\ndecomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related\ncomponents, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the\ntextual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter\nand the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian\nsemantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided\nFeature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information\nfor identification from the style-related features and restores it back into\nthe pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the\nfeatures after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with\nthat between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings.\nExtensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nour DSFAD."}

While the detection of\nhateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform\nhateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the\npowerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This\npaper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting\ntechnique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for\nmitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing\nhateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,\nVLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.\nFurthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a\nstrong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet\nhuman-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between\nimage and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of\nstate-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the\nproposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective\nstrengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on\nimportant applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online\nenvironments."}

In this paper, we propose and\nformulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM\nmulti-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When\ndataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems\nwith fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive\nerror steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated\nfailure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The\nbest method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents\nbut only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below\nrandom. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to\nachieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and\nthe need for further research in this area.

Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the\nquality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate\nhow LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning\nin-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than\nrelying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and\nrefining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a\nnaive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test\nperformance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),\nand InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent\nachieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two\nextensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to\nidentify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection\nthat retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as\nin-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving\n91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific\ncomponents and prompts.

Despite its popularity for\nprivate documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for\nvalidating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data\nsuch as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.\nSeeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA\nbenchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs\nacross 150 different user inboxes.

Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic\nattention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We\nhypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more\nefficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),\na novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice\nrouting. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing\narbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of\nlength $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head\nfrom $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same\ncomputational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the\ntested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the\ndense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical\ncompute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense\nself-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,\nperplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,\nrequire less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the\nKV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines."}

Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,\npixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus\noverlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that\nsystematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both\nopen-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian\nmechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects.

While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.\nFirst, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task\ntypes), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving\nperformance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of\ndomains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via\nR&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity\n(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data\ncomposition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients\nobtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for\nadditional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or\ngradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and\nprovide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to\nnon-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and\nmultimodal tasks.
