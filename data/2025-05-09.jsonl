In the model construction\nprocess, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively\nintroduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising\nstep size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not\nonly dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also\nrespond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic\ninteraction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that\ncompared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the\nmodel we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,\ncoherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the\nsubjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated\ninteraction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human\ncommunication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model\noutperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more\npowerful support for effective communication."}

In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation\ntechniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a\n``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error,\nthat allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations.\nThis approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a\nquadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then\nrelaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP\nproblem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative\nsolver (called \\textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and\nits associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers.

Existing methods struggle with these\nchallenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from\nattention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based\nmethods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to\nfeature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables\nprecise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named\nMDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via\ntwo key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention\nwith segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency\nLoss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing\nleakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and\ncoherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality,\noffering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks."}

Its severity is typically\nevaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation\ncan be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring\nthe region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to\nless consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are\ncurrently available for automated evaluation of this condition from\nbronchoscopy video.\n  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity\nestimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician\nto traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of\nillumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a\n3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is\nused to measure the airway narrowing.\n  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic\nstenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show\nconsistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,\nand reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our\nevaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real\nbronchoscopy procedures data.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis\nseverity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten\ndiagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations\nand less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is\nrequired. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic\nstenosis severity assessment."}

While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources\noften introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image\nquality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.\nIn this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object\ndetector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when\nexposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a\nsignificant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect\nobjects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be\nexploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving\nassistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,\n\"manufacturer C\", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors\n(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle\nlighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental\nfactors.

Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a\npromising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data\ndistributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.\nNevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional\nartificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this\ngap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time\nadaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution\nshifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which\ndynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired\nnormalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental\nresults on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in\nimproving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining\nlow computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for\nonline test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of\nfuture neuromorphic chips.

The BPI estimation incorporates the local information\nof the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the\nnucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels\nusing a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation\nresults are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected\ncomponent analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of\nsynergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore,\ndifferent from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus\nboundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its\nboundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using\nan integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable\nencoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some\nreceptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy\nimprovement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in\nthe model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique.\nExtensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to\nseveral typical benchmark models."}
