To do this, we develop a set of Gold\ncode-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering\nwithin and across the subcarriers.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training.

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled.

By leveraging two sets of data\ncollected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we\nfirst construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then\nestablish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original\nsystem and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation\nfunctions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness.\nTo achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient\nconditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering\ncorrectness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can\nbe employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system\nsatisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing\ncontrollers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to\nthe original system through an interface function.

By decomposing dynamic\ntraffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for\nseamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the\nframework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,\nenabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X\ndriving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across\nego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D\ntracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates\nchallenging corner cases.", "comment": "IROS 2025, Code: https://github.com/SainingZhang/CRUISE", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18473v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-24", "updated": "2025-07-24"}

To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We\ninstantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate\nits effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings\nfrom prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its\narchitecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of\ntopological neighborhoods.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18607v1", "cate": "cs.CG", "date": "2025-07-24", "updated": "2025-07-24"}

To address these challenges,\nthis research utilizes two prominent fairness libraries, Fairlearn by Microsoft\nand AIF360 by IBM. These libraries offer comprehensive frameworks for fairness\nanalysis, providing tools to evaluate fairness metrics, visualize results, and\nimplement bias mitigation algorithms. The study focuses on assessing and\nmitigating biases for unstructured datasets using Computer Vision (CV) and\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models. The primary objective is to present a\ncomparative analysis of the performance of mitigation algorithms from the two\nfairness libraries. This analysis involves applying the algorithms\nindividually, one at a time, in one of the stages of the ML lifecycle,\npre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing, as well as sequentially\nacross more than one stage.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations.
