### [1] [Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197)
*Pinxin Liu,Haiyang Liu,Luchuan Song,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于意图推理的手势生成框架Intentional-Gesture，通过结合高层次交际功能，解决了现有方法语义浅薄的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势生成方法仅依赖语言线索（如语音或文本），忽略了交际意图，导致生成手势语义不足。

Method: 引入Intentional-Gesture框架，通过标注手势意图（使用大视觉语言模型自动标注）和意图感知的运动表示，实现语义丰富的手势生成。

Result: 在BEAT-2基准测试中达到最新最优性能，生成的手势既时间对齐又语义丰富。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字人和具身AI提供了模块化的手势生成基础，具有表达力。

Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as
adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture
generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.}
speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the
communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs
that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework
that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in
high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset
by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text
sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using
large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional
Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects
high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized
motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are
both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a
modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and
embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture

### [2] [Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks for Document Layout Analysis in Public Affairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14699)
*Miguel Lopez-Duran,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Ruben Tolosana,Oscar Delgado-Mohatar,Alvaro Ortigosa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何利用图神经网络（GNN）对数字原生PDF文档的布局进行细粒度分类，提出了两种图构建方法，并通过实验验证了GraphSAGE在双分支配置下的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字原生PDF文档的布局分析因文本和非文本元素的异构排列及PDF格式的元数据不精确而具有挑战性，需要一种自动化的高效方法。

Method: 提出了两种图构建结构（k近邻图和全连接图），并利用预训练的文本和视觉模型生成节点特征，避免了手动特征工程。评估了三种实验框架（单模态、多模态拼接和双分支多模态）和四种GNN模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，GraphSAGE在k近邻图的双分支配置下表现最佳，在部分数据源中优于基线方法，验证了局部布局关系和多模态融合的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究证实了GNN在数字原生文档布局分析中的潜力，尤其是通过局部关系和多模态融合提升分类准确性。

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents
remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual
and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the
Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN)
architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks
from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures:
a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node
features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature
engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text
or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated
four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our
experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs
documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level
official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results
demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a
dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy,
outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the
importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited
through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

### [3] [EVA: Expressive Virtual Avatars from Multi-view Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15385)
*Hendrik Junkawitsch,Guoxing Sun,Heming Zhu,Christian Theobalt,Marc Habermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVA框架通过双层模型（几何层与外观层）实现高保真、实时渲染的虚拟人类化身，独立控制面部表情、身体动作和手势，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法完全独立控制面部表情和身体动作，限制了虚拟化身的表达性和逼真度。

Method: 设计双层模型：几何层用于动作和表情跟踪，外观层通过解耦的3D高斯模型分别建模身体和面部。

Result: EVA在渲染质量和表达性上优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EVA为可驱动的数字人类模型提供了重要进展，实现了逼真的虚拟化身。

Abstract: With recent advancements in neural rendering and motion capture algorithms,
remarkable progress has been made in photorealistic human avatar modeling,
unlocking immense potential for applications in virtual reality, augmented
reality, remote communication, and industries such as gaming, film, and
medicine. However, existing methods fail to provide complete, faithful, and
expressive control over human avatars due to their entangled representation of
facial expressions and body movements. In this work, we introduce Expressive
Virtual Avatars (EVA), an actor-specific, fully controllable, and expressive
human avatar framework that achieves high-fidelity, lifelike renderings in real
time while enabling independent control of facial expressions, body movements,
and hand gestures. Specifically, our approach designs the human avatar as a
two-layer model: an expressive template geometry layer and a 3D Gaussian
appearance layer. First, we present an expressive template tracking algorithm
that leverages coarse-to-fine optimization to accurately recover body motions,
facial expressions, and non-rigid deformation parameters from multi-view
videos. Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model
designed to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance. Unlike unified
Gaussian estimation approaches, our method employs two specialized and
independent modules to model the body and face separately. Experimental results
demonstrate that EVA surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering
quality and expressiveness, validating its effectiveness in creating full-body
avatars. This work represents a significant advancement towards fully drivable
digital human models, enabling the creation of lifelike digital avatars that
faithfully replicate human geometry and appearance.

### [4] [Beyond Modality Collapse: Representations Blending for Multimodal Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14705)
*Xin Zhang,Ziruo Zhang,Jiawei Du,Zuozhu Liu,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出RepBlend框架，通过表示混合和对称投影轨迹匹配解决多模态数据集蒸馏中的模态崩溃问题，显著提升跨模态学习效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态数据集蒸馏方法存在模态崩溃问题，表现为模态内表示过度集中和模态间分布差距扩大，影响跨模态学习效果。

Method: 提出RepBlend框架，通过表示混合减弱跨模态监督的过度主导，并引入对称投影轨迹匹配以平衡模态间的优化动态。

Result: 在Flickr-30K和MS-COCO数据集上，RepBlend显著优于现有方法，检索性能提升（如IR@10提高9.4），且蒸馏速度提升6.7倍。

Conclusion: RepBlend有效缓解模态崩溃问题，提升多模态数据集蒸馏的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Dataset Distillation (MDD) seeks to condense large-scale
image-text datasets into compact surrogates while retaining their effectiveness
for cross-modal learning. Despite recent progress, existing MDD approaches
often suffer from \textit{\textbf{Modality Collapse}}, characterized by
over-concentrated intra-modal representations and enlarged distributional gap
across modalities. In this paper, at the first time, we identify this issue as
stemming from a fundamental conflict between the over-compression behavior
inherent in dataset distillation and the cross-modal supervision imposed by
contrastive objectives. To alleviate modality collapse, we introduce
\textbf{RepBlend}, a novel MDD framework that weakens overdominant cross-modal
supervision via representation blending, thereby significantly enhancing
intra-modal diversity. Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose
asymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To
address this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which
synchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection
heads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal
alignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend
consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving
significant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under
the 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\times$ distillation speedup.

### [5] [PlantDreamer: Achieving Realistic 3D Plant Models with Diffusion-Guided Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15528)
*Zane K J Hartley,Lewis A G Stuart,Andrew P French,Michael P Pound*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlantDreamer提出了一种新的3D植物生成方法，通过结合深度ControlNet、低秩适应和高斯剔除算法，显著提升了生成植物的真实感和几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型在复杂植物生成上表现不佳，限制了植物分析工具的应用。PlantDreamer旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用深度ControlNet、低秩适应和高斯剔除算法，支持纯合成生成和真实点云增强。

Result: PlantDreamer在生成高保真3D植物上优于现有方法，并能升级传统点云数据集。

Conclusion: PlantDreamer不仅推动了合成植物生成技术，还为3D表型分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial improvements in the ability to generate
synthetic 3D objects using AI. However, generating complex 3D objects, such as
plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle
with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in
plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We
introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation,
which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and
textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation
pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an
adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism
and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally,
PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging
L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds
by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by
comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating
that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity
synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances
synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point
cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.

### [6] [CrypticBio: A Large Multimodal Dataset for Visually Confusing Biodiversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14707)
*Georgiana Manolache,Gerard Schouten,Joaquin Vanschoren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrypticBio是一个公开的多模态数据集，专注于视觉上难以区分的物种，旨在支持生物多样性AI模型的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多为单一种类且规模小，无法满足对视觉相似物种的广泛识别需求。CrypticBio填补了这一空白。

Method: 数据集包含52K独特物种组，覆盖67K物种和1.66亿张图像，整合了多语言术语、时空数据等多模态信息。

Result: 基准测试显示地理上下文对视觉-语言零样本学习有显著影响。

Conclusion: CrypticBio有望推动生物多样性AI模型的发展，解决物种模糊性挑战。

Abstract: We present CrypticBio, the largest publicly available multimodal dataset of
visually confusing species, specifically curated to support the development of
AI models in the context of biodiversity applications. Visually confusing or
cryptic species are groups of two or more taxa that are nearly
indistinguishable based on visual characteristics alone. While much existing
work addresses taxonomic identification in a broad sense, datasets that
directly address the morphological confusion of cryptic species are small,
manually curated, and target only a single taxon. Thus, the challenge of
identifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains
unaddressed. Curated from real-world trends in species misidentification among
community annotators of iNaturalist, CrypticBio contains 52K unique cryptic
groups spanning 67K species, represented in 166 million images. Rich
research-grade image annotations--including scientific, multicultural, and
multilingual species terminology, hierarchical taxonomy, spatiotemporal
context, and associated cryptic groups--address multimodal AI in biodiversity
research. For easy dataset curation, we provide an open-source pipeline
CrypticBio-Curate. The multimodal nature of the dataset beyond vision-language
arises from the integration of geographical and temporal data as complementary
cues to identifying cryptic species. To highlight the importance of the
dataset, we benchmark a suite of state-of-the-art foundation models across
CrypticBio subsets of common, unseen, endangered, and invasive species, and
demonstrate the substantial impact of geographical context on vision-language
zero-shot learning for cryptic species. By introducing CrypticBio, we aim to
catalyze progress toward real-world-ready biodiversity AI models capable of
handling the nuanced challenges of species ambiguity.

### [7] [DraftAttention: Fast Video Diffusion via Low-Resolution Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14708)
*Xuan Shen,Chenxia Han,Yufa Zhou,Yanyue Xie,Yifan Gong,Quanyi Wang,Yiwei Wang,Yanzhi Wang,Pu Zhao,Jiuxiang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DraftAttention的无训练框架，通过动态稀疏注意力加速视频扩散变换器，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散变换器的视频生成模型（DiTs）因计算成本高（注意力机制占80%以上延迟）而难以实际应用，亟需优化。

Method: 采用压缩潜在空间中的特征图下采样，生成低分辨率草稿注意力图，揭示时空冗余，并通过重排序实现结构化稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频生成质量上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，并在GPU上实现了1.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: DraftAttention通过动态稀疏注意力有效降低了计算成本，为视频扩散变换器的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently
attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However,
their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts
for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video
takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and
scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free
framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic
sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across
frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field
over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution
draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both
spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the
query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse
attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their
original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables
structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention
closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for
constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation
quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs. Code:

### [8] [FastCar: Cache Attentive Replay for Fast Auto-Regressive Video Generation on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14709)
*Xuan Shen,Weize Ma,Yufa Zhou,Enhao Tang,Yanyue Xie,Zhengang Li,Yifan Gong,Quanyi Wang,Henghui Ding,Yiwei Wang,Yanzhi Wang,Pu Zhao,Jun Lin,Jiuxiang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastCar框架通过利用时间冗余加速自回归视频生成的解码阶段，提出Temporal Attention Score（TAS）和硬件加速器，显著提升解码速度和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视频生成中因需要大量令牌而效率低下，MLP模块在解码阶段占主导延迟且存在时间冗余。

Method: 提出FastCar框架，利用TAS决定是否重用前一帧的MLP输出以减少计算，并开发基于FPGA的硬件加速器。

Result: 实验显示FastCar比传统稀疏注意力方法快2.1倍，能效更高，且能提升稀疏注意力的性能。

Conclusion: FastCar为高分辨率和长时视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Auto-regressive (AR) models, initially successful in language generation,
have recently shown promise in visual generation tasks due to their superior
sampling efficiency. Unlike image generation, video generation requires a
substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,
resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key
observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference
latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of
adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to
accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the
temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to
determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached
MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with
detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware
accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to
enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional
sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher
energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse
attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with
alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution
and long-duration video generation. Code:

### [9] [KGAlign: Joint Semantic-Structural Knowledge Encoding for Multimodal Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14714)
*Tuan-Vinh La,Minh-Hieu Nguyen,Minh-Son Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合视觉、文本和知识的多模态假新闻检测框架，通过细粒度对象捕捉、全局图像语义和上下文文本编码，结合知识图谱增强语义理解，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻检测因文本误导、图像篡改和外部知识推理的复杂性而具有挑战性，现有方法忽视了局部对象细节和外部知识利用。

Method: 提出多模态框架，结合视觉（细粒度对象捕捉和全局语义）、文本（RoBERTa编码）和知识图谱（实体检索与选择），通过Transformer分类器预测新闻真实性。

Result: 实验表明，模型优于现有方法，验证了邻居选择机制和多模态融合的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过知识驱动的多模态推理和语义验证，为假新闻检测提供了新范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex
interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external
knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in
verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1)
Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting
local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge
and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that
integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach
leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for
global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further
enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant
entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed
through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing
the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for
fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded
multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and
NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to
semantically grounded verification. For reproducibility and further research,
the source code is publicly at

### [10] [Enhancing Shape Perception and Segmentation Consistency for Industrial Image Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14718)
*Guoxuan Mao,Ting Cao,Ziyang Li,Yuan Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种形状感知高效网络（SPENet），通过分别监督边界和主体信息的提取，实现了优异的语义分割一致性，并引入可变边界域（VBD）和新指标CMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割模型在工业图像检测中因缺乏对物体轮廓的感知而无法保持固定组件的一致性，且需满足实时性和低计算复杂度。

Method: SPENet通过分别提取和监督边界与主体信息，引入VBD描述模糊边界，并提出CMSE衡量分割一致性。

Result: 在数据集上取得最佳分割精度和竞争性速度，CMSE指标显著优于其他实时分割网络，降低50%以上。

Conclusion: SPENet在工业图像检测中表现出色，兼顾分割一致性和计算效率。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation stands as a pivotal research focus in computer vision.
In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic
segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed
components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception
of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing
capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to
create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a
Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes
of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately
supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In
SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better
adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD).
Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to
measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the
best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing
significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time
segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the
previously top-performing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN-Transformer架构在多尺度特征提取上存在瓶颈，限制了其性能。

Result: 实验表明MSVIT在多个数据集上优于现有SNN-Transformer模型，成为该领域的先进解决方案。

Conclusion: MSVIT通过多尺度脉冲注意力有效提升了SNN-Transformer的性能，为高效能计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) with Vision Transformer
architectures has attracted significant attention due to the great potential
for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a
substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based
transformer architectures. While existing methods propose spiking
self-attention mechanisms that are successfully combined with SNNs, the overall
architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively
extracting features from different image scales. In this paper, we address this
issue and propose MSVIT, a novel spike-driven Transformer architecture, which
firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enrich the capability of
spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main data
sets. The experimental results show that MSVIT outperforms existing SNN-based
models, positioning itself as a state-of-the-art solution among SNN-transformer
architectures. The codes are available at

### [12] [MORALISE: A Structured Benchmark for Moral Alignment in Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14728)
*Xiao Lin,Zhining Liu,Ze Yang,Gaotang Li,Ruizhong Qiu,Shuke Wang,Hui Liu,Haotian Li,Sumit Keswani,Vishwa Pardeshi,Huijun Zhao,Wei Fan,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MORALISE基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的道德对齐能力，通过多样化的专家验证数据揭示现有模型的道德局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型在高风险领域的广泛应用，确保其输出符合人类道德价值观至关重要，而现有研究存在模态单一或数据偏见的问题。

Method: 基于Turiel的领域理论，构建了13个道德主题的分类法，并手动标注了2,481个高质量图像-文本对，设计了道德判断和道德规范归因两项评估任务。

Result: 实验表明，MORALISE对19种主流VLMs提出了显著挑战，揭示了当前模型的道德局限性。

Conclusion: MORALISE为评估和改进VLMs的道德对齐提供了重要工具，推动了模型在道德敏感领域的应用。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader
discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated
increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving
and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world
applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align
with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing
work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies
heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced
realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)
using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a
comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,
spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in
everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality
image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic
annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality
annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.
For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and
\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral
violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive
experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses
a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current
state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多任务中表现出色，但其潜在的文化偏见引发关注。本研究旨在评估VLMs在识别不同国家时的偏见程度。

Method: 使用Country211数据集，通过开放式问题、多选题（包括多语言和对抗性设置）等多种提问策略，评估多个大型VLMs的性能。

Result: 研究发现模型性能在不同国家和提问方式下存在显著差异，表明VLMs继承了预训练数据中的偏见，影响了其在全球多样化背景下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VLMs虽具备强大的视觉理解能力，但其性能受预训练数据分布和规模的影响，需进一步优化以减少文化偏见。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks, yet concerns about their potential biases exist. This
work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by
evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a
country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we
probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting
strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including
challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis
aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and
question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and
evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings
highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs
possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their
pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly
across diverse global contexts.

Motivation: 探索人类身份的形成过程，利用扩散模型生成的人脸图像间接研究身份与外部因素的关系。

Method: 采用扩散模型生成人脸图像，通过改变外部输入观察生成图像的变化，建立模型生成过程与人类身份形成的对应关系。

Conclusion: 人类身份具有流动性，受外部因素影响显著，并通过视频艺术作品《Fluidity of Human Identity》进一步表达这一观点。

Abstract: This paper attempts to explore human identity by utilizing neural networks in
an indirect manner. For this exploration, we adopt diffusion models,
state-of-the-art AI generative models trained to create human face images. By
relating the generated human face to human identity, we establish a
correspondence between the face image generation process of the diffusion model
and the process of human identity formation. Through experiments with the
diffusion model, we observe that changes in its external input result in
significant changes in the generated face image. Based on the correspondence,
we indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in
the process of human identity formation. Furthermore, we introduce
\textit{Fluidity of Human Identity}, a video artwork that expresses the fluid
nature of human identity affected by varying external factors. The video is

Abstract: Many practical medical imaging scenarios include categories that are
under-represented but still crucial. The relevance of image recognition models
to real-world applications lies in their ability to generalize to these rare
classes as well as unseen classes. Real-world generalization requires taking
into account the various complexities that can be encountered in the
real-world. First, training data is highly imbalanced, which may lead to model
exhibiting bias toward the more frequently represented classes. Moreover,
real-world data may contain unseen classes that need to be identified, and
model performance is affected by the data scarcity. While medical image
recognition has been extensively addressed in the literature, current methods
do not take into account all the intricacies in the real-world scenarios. To
this end, we propose an open-set learning method for highly imbalanced medical
datasets using a semi-supervised approach. Understanding the adverse impact of
long-tail distribution at the inherent model characteristics, we implement a
regularization strategy at the feature level complemented by a classifier
normalization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly
available datasets, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and TissueMNIST with various numbers of
labelled samples. Our analysis shows that addressing the impact of long-tail
data in classification significantly improves the overall performance of the
network in terms of closed-set and open-set accuracies on all datasets. Our
code and trained models will be made publicly available at

Abstract: This study presents a robust framework that leverages advanced imaging
techniques and machine learning for feature extraction and classification of
key human attributes-namely skin tone, hair color, iris color, and vein-based
undertones. The system employs a multi-stage pipeline involving face detection,
region segmentation, and dominant color extraction to isolate and analyze these
features. Techniques such as X-means clustering, alongside perceptually uniform
distance metrics like Delta E (CIEDE2000), are applied within both LAB and HSV
color spaces to enhance the accuracy of color differentiation. For
classification, the dominant tones of the skin, hair, and iris are extracted
and matched to a custom tone scale, while vein analysis from wrist images
enables undertone classification into "Warm" or "Cool" based on LAB
differences. Each module uses targeted segmentation and color space
transformations to ensure perceptual precision. The system achieves up to 80%
accuracy in tone classification using the Delta E-HSV method with Gaussian
blur, demonstrating reliable performance across varied lighting and image
conditions. This work highlights the potential of AI-powered color analysis and
feature extraction for delivering inclusive, precise, and nuanced
classification, supporting applications in beauty technology, digital
personalization, and visual analytics.

Abstract: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real
world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for
future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics
applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing
plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual
context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of
video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of
neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging
the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In
particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate
the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to
predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the
transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames.
Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing
techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging
environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits
counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its
effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

Conclusion: MultiMAE策略显著提升了多模态地球观测数据的迁移学习能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modal data in Earth Observation (EO) presents a huge opportunity for
improving transfer learning capabilities when pre-training deep learning
models. Unlike prior work that often overlooks multi-modal EO data, recent
methods have started to include it, resulting in more effective pre-training
strategies. However, existing approaches commonly face challenges in
effectively transferring learning to downstream tasks where the structure of
available data differs from that used during pre-training. This paper addresses
this limitation by exploring a more flexible multi-modal, multi-task
pre-training strategy for EO data. Specifically, we adopt a Multi-modal
Multi-task Masked Autoencoder (MultiMAE) that we pre-train by reconstructing
diverse input modalities, including spectral, elevation, and segmentation data.
The pre-trained model demonstrates robust transfer learning capabilities,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various EO datasets for
classification and segmentation tasks. Our approach exhibits significant
flexibility, handling diverse input configurations without requiring
modality-specific pre-trained models. Code will be available at:

Motivation: 城市森林对环境和生物多样性至关重要，但树木检测因复杂景观和图像分辨率差异而困难，且深度学习依赖大量标注数据。

Result: 实验显示，低分辨率图像的IoU提升超过50%，方法优于传统流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感场景提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，尤其在标注资源稀缺时。

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and
supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces
are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees
is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image
resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While
deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges,
their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and
manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in
sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates
domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of
low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution
imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation
without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models
such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we
generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand
the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only
improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition
conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote
sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results
demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端方法基于密集鸟瞰图特征生成计划，效率低且规划意识有限，iPad旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在NAVSIM和CARLA Bench2Drive基准测试中，iPad实现了最先进的性能，且效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iPad通过迭代优化和轻量级辅助任务，为端到端自动驾驶提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving systems offer a promising alternative to
traditional modular pipelines by reducing information loss and error
accumulation, with significant potential to enhance both mobility and safety.
However, most existing E2E approaches directly generate plans based on dense
bird's-eye view (BEV) grid features, leading to inefficiency and limited
planning awareness. To address these limitations, we propose iterative
Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places
proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature
extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder
that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through
proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data.
Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks -
mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art
performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP)的方法，通过增强疾病相关区域并抑制背景干扰，显著提升了医学图像中视觉定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中难以将文本描述与疾病区域关联，主要由于注意力机制效率低和缺乏细粒度表征。

Method: 引入DAP方法，利用视觉语言模型的可解释性图识别合适的图像特征，无需额外像素级标注。

Result: DAP在三个主要胸部X光数据集上比现有方法提升了20.74%的视觉定位准确率。

Conclusion: DAP是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了医学图像中视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in
an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG
enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features
corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and
trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical
practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with
disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of
fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate
two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background
tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the
global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local
disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and
disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective
Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a
VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies
disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any
additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by
20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray
datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视目标类与非目标类知识流的冲突，且低置信度暗知识引入噪声信号，影响知识传递效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet和MS-COCO上验证了DeepKD的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepKD通过解耦和去噪机制显著提升了知识蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of
decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize
momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they
overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class
knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target
classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To
address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that
integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through
theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics
in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design
independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual
interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for
task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class
gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce
a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small
initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses,
following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters
low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively
purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code

Abstract: Multispectral object detection aims to leverage complementary information
from visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities to enable robust performance
under diverse environmental conditions. In this letter, we propose IC-Fusion, a
multispectral object detector that effectively fuses visible and infrared
features through a lightweight and modalityaware design. Motivated by wavelet
analysis and empirical observations, we find that IR images contain
structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object localization,
while RGB images provide complementary semantic context. To exploit this, we
adopt a compact RGB backbone and design a novel fusion module comprising a
Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a
three-stage fusion block with Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG) and
Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG) to facilitate effective cross-modal

Conclusion: ConneX通过高效的多模态融合，显著提升了脑连接数据的诊断能力。

Abstract: Gaining insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of the brain
has been a longstanding focus in neuroscience research, particularly in the
context of understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as
Schizophrenia (SZ). Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep
learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of
structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance.
To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that
integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for
refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs)
were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A
unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these
embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer
layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies
for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive
evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical
datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping
mood, emotion, and narrative through visual elements such as camera movement,
shot composition, and lighting. Despite recent progress in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current
models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely
uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this
gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise,
manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography
dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot
angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and
includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear
cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question
answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret
and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess
advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct
cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or
keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video
generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current
models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in
automatically film production and appreciation. The code and benchmark can be

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究提供了全面视角，总结了DL在RSISS中的关键进展和开放挑战。

Abstract: Remote sensing images (RSIs) capture both natural and human-induced changes
on the Earth's surface, serving as essential data for environmental monitoring,
urban planning, and resource management. Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs
enables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a
critical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and
volume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional
processing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response,
deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling
substantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by
automating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across
diverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by
categorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based
methods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging
image-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these
developments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning
strategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level
and from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset
to quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review
offers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements,
comparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.

Conclusion: ALN-P3有效结合驾驶与语言推理，且不影响推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into
end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either
driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to
achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified
co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast"
vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning
modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception
Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A),
which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs
across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment
modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during
inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X,
TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both
driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

overhead. Token compression techniques have attracted considerable attention to
address this issue, but they often suffer from severe information loss,
requiring extensive additional training to achieve practical performance. In
this paper, we propose Adaptive Token Merging (ATM), a novel method that
ensures lossless token merging, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while
maintaining competitive performance. ATM adaptively reduces tokens across
layers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds,
thereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect
to each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique
that considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the
final layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging
operation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained
models, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free
methods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without
additional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30%
reduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their
original accuracy.

*Xinran Wang,Muxi Diao,Yuanzhi Liu,Chunyu Wang,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma,Jun Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的度量标准（ICR和AOD）来评估文本到图像（T2I）模型训练中描述的详细程度，优于传统的长度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的指标（如标题长度）来衡量描述的详细程度，无法全面反映内容覆盖和对象细节。

Method: 提出图像覆盖率（ICR）和平均对象细节度（AOD）两个指标，用于评估标题的详细程度。

Result: 在COCO数据集上实验表明，使用高ICR和AOD标题训练的T2I模型性能更优，且仅需20%数据即可超越全数据集训练。

Conclusion: 详细感知的度量标准在T2I任务中比基于长度的启发式方法更有效。

Abstract: Training text-to-image (T2I) models with detailed captions can significantly
improve their generation quality. Existing methods often rely on simplistic
metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the
T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption
detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates
whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object
detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description.
Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we
demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve
superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables
more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both
full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment
and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of
detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I
tasks.

TL;DR: AvatarShield是一个基于MLLM的可解释框架，用于检测以人为中心的伪造视频，通过GRPO优化和双编码器架构实现高效检测，并在新数据集FakeHumanVid上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC技术的快速发展带来了视频生成的创造力提升，但也增加了信息完整性、身份安全和公众信任的威胁。现有检测方法在人为中心视频中表现不足，且存在泛化性差、扩展性有限等问题。

Method: 提出AvatarShield框架，结合GRPO优化和双编码器架构（高级语义推理与低级伪影放大），避免高成本文本标注数据，实现精确时间建模和伪造检测。

Result: 在FakeHumanVid数据集上的实验表明，AvatarShield在域内和跨域检测中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AvatarShield为以人为中心的视频取证设立了新标准，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented
creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity,
identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while
effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos,
which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and
ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor
generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised
fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first
interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos,
enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully
designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it
effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise
temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder
architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact
amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect
FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes
synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous
evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments
show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both
in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric
video forensics.

Motivation: 跨域步态识别因视角、外观和环境差异面临挑战，混合数据集训练虽常用但存在优化冲突和噪声样本问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升跨域识别性能，且不影响源域准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了跨域步态识别的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Generalized gait recognition, which aims to achieve robust performance across
diverse domains, remains a challenging problem due to severe domain shifts in
viewpoints, appearances, and environments. While mixed-dataset training is
widely used to enhance generalization, it introduces new obstacles including
inter-dataset optimization conflicts and redundant or noisy samples, both of
which hinder effective representation learning. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified framework that systematically improves cross-domain gait
recognition. First, we design a disentangled triplet loss that isolates
supervision signals across datasets, mitigating gradient conflicts during
optimization. Second, we introduce a targeted dataset distillation strategy
that filters out the least informative 20\% of training samples based on
feature redundancy and prediction uncertainty, enhancing data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW demonstrate that
our method significantly improves cross-dataset recognition for both GaitBase
and DeepGaitV2 backbones, without sacrificing source-domain accuracy. Code will
be released at https://github.com/li1er3/Generalized_Gait.

Motivation: 现有红外小目标检测方法依赖单一视觉建模，难以应对复杂背景干扰和目标特征稀缺的问题，且在多场景中泛化能力有限。

Result: 在WideIRSTD-Full基准测试中，AuxDet表现优于现有方法，验证了辅助信息对提升检测鲁棒性和准确性的重要性。

Conclusion: AuxDet通过结合元数据，显著提升了红外小目标检测在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable
challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems,
varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current
approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only
struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target
features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex
omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance
variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing
paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing
imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor
platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this
limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target
Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines
the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware
optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with
visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual
sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement
module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and
recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging
WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information
in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks. Code is

Conclusion: MonoSplat通过融合单目与多视图特征，显著提升了3D高斯重建的泛化性和质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated
promising results in real-time high-fidelity rendering without per-scene
optimization, yet existing approaches still struggle to handle unfamiliar
visual content during inference on novel scenes due to limited
generalizability. To address this challenge, we introduce MonoSplat, a novel
framework that leverages rich visual priors from pre-trained monocular depth
foundation models for robust Gaussian reconstruction. Our approach consists of
two key components: a Mono-Multi Feature Adapter that transforms monocular
features into multi-view representations, coupled with an Integrated Gaussian
Prediction module that effectively fuses both feature types for precise
Gaussian generation. Through the Adapter's lightweight attention mechanism,
features are seamlessly aligned and aggregated across views while preserving
valuable monocular priors, enabling the Prediction module to generate Gaussian
primitives with accurate geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments
on diverse real-world datasets, we convincingly demonstrate that MonoSplat
achieves superior reconstruction quality and generalization capability compared
to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency with minimal
trainable parameters. Codes are available at

Abstract: Transfer learning under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge due to
the divergence between source and target data manifolds. In this paper, we

that decomposes adversarial perturbations into on-manifold and off-manifold
components to simultaneously capture semantic variation and model brittleness.
We theoretically demonstrate that enforcing on-manifold consistency reduces
hypothesis complexity and improves generalization, while off-manifold
regularization smooths decision boundaries in low-density regions. Moreover, we
introduce a geometry-aware alignment loss that minimizes geodesic discrepancy
between source and target manifolds. Experiments on DomainNet, VisDA, and
Office-Home show that MAADA consistently outperforms existing adversarial and
adaptation methods in both unsupervised and few-shot settings, demonstrating
superior structural robustness and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video
understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that
integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual
encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of
recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from
conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive
multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual
annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships.
These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions,
allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention
mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by
modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength
of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust
and generalizable action recognition.

Abstract: Domain adaptation remains a challenge when there is significant manifold
discrepancy between source and target domains. Although recent methods leverage
manifold-aware adversarial perturbations to perform data augmentation, they
often neglect precise manifold alignment and systematic exploration of
structured perturbations. To address this, we propose GAMA (Geometry-Aware
Manifold Alignment), a structured framework that achieves explicit manifold
alignment via adversarial perturbation guided by geometric information. GAMA
systematically employs tangent space exploration and manifold-constrained
adversarial optimization, simultaneously enhancing semantic consistency,
robustness to off-manifold deviations, and cross-domain alignment. Theoretical
analysis shows that GAMA tightens the generalization bound via structured
regularization and explicit alignment. Empirical results on DomainNet, VisDA,

Conclusion: Flashback通过零样本和实时处理能力，为大规模监控部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from
video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance
deployments. However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption:
domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous
processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot
and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive
mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based
on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In
the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of
both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data.
In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched
against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at
inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU.
On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp),
respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.

Abstract: Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for
improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches
have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D
style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to
3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of
the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture
transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture
transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching
texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the
issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture
augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a
geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into
the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and
3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented
appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By
alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over
multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture
features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric
awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align
with human visual perception. Our homepage is available at

Result: 在GenImage数据集和最新生成模型上表现出优异的泛化性能。

Conclusion: InfoFD通过多模态条件设计有效提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Although existing CLIP-based methods for detecting AI-generated images have
achieved promising results, they are still limited by severe feature
redundancy, which hinders their generalization ability. To address this issue,
incorporating an information bottleneck network into the task presents a
straightforward solution. However, relying solely on image-corresponding
prompts results in suboptimal performance due to the inherent diversity of
prompts. In this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional bottleneck network
to reduce feature redundancy while enhancing the discriminative power of
features extracted by CLIP, thereby improving the model's generalization
ability. We begin with a semantic analysis experiment, where we observe that
arbitrary text features exhibit lower cosine similarity with real image
features than with fake image features in the CLIP feature space, a phenomenon
we refer to as "bias". Therefore, we introduce InfoFD, a text-guided
AI-generated image detection framework. InfoFD consists of two key components:
the Text-Guided Conditional Information Bottleneck (TGCIB) and Dynamic Text
Orthogonalization (DTO). TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned
representations by conditioning on both text and class modalities. DTO
dynamically updates weighted text features, preserving semantic information
while leveraging the global "bias". Our model achieves exceptional
generalization performance on the GenImage dataset and latest generative
models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ant0ny44/InfoFD.

Abstract: Recently, continuous representation methods emerge as novel paradigms that
characterize the intrinsic structures of real-world data through function
representations that map positional coordinates to their corresponding values
in the continuous space. As compared with the traditional discrete framework,
the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data
representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view
synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including
resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and
parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent
advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three
aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function
representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and
implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous
representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and
implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous
representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and
remote sensing. Furthermore, we outline future directions and perspectives to
inspire exploration and deepen insights to facilitate continuous representation
methods, theories, and applications. All referenced works are summarized in our

Conclusion: 高质量样本的紧凑集可以超越大规模训练，DC-Scene为3D场景理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding plays a fundamental role in vision applications such
as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, advancing
learning-based 3D scene understanding remains challenging due to two key
limitations: (1) the large scale and complexity of 3D scenes lead to higher
computational costs and slower training compared to 2D counterparts; and (2)
high-quality annotated 3D datasets are significantly scarcer than those
available for 2D vision. These challenges underscore the need for more
efficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric
framework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data
quality and training efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven
dual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores
with caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that
progressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of
scene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly
reduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art
performance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset)
while reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a
compact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training. Code

Conclusion: 和谐整合多模态互补信息对深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of multimodal deepfakes (visual and auditory content are
manipulated in concert) undermines the reliability of existing detectors that
rely solely on modality-specific artifacts or cross-modal inconsistencies. In
this work, we first demonstrate that modality-specific forensic traces (e.g.,
face-swap artifacts or spectral distortions) and modality-shared semantic
misalignments (e.g., lip-speech asynchrony) offer complementary evidence, and
that neglecting either aspect limits detection performance. Existing approaches
either naively fuse modality-specific features without reconciling their
conflicting characteristics or focus predominantly on semantic misalignment at
the expense of modality-specific fine-grained artifact cues. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a general multimodal framework for video deepfake
detection via Cross-Modal Alignment and Distillation (CAD). CAD comprises two
core components: 1) Cross-modal alignment that identifies inconsistencies in
high-level semantic synchronization (e.g., lip-speech mismatches); 2)
Cross-modal distillation that mitigates feature conflicts during fusion while
preserving modality-specific forensic traces (e.g., spectral distortions in
synthetic audio). Extensive experiments on both multimodal and unimodal (e.g.,
image-only/video-only)deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CAD significantly
outperforms previous methods, validating the necessity of harmonious
integration of multimodal complementary information.

Abstract: Despite progress in geometry-aware domain adaptation, current methods such as
GAMA still suffer from two unresolved issues: (1) insufficient disentanglement
of task-relevant and task-irrelevant manifold dimensions, and (2) rigid
perturbation schemes that ignore per-class alignment asymmetries. To address
this, we propose GAMA++, a novel framework that introduces (i) latent space
disentanglement to isolate label-consistent manifold directions from nuisance
factors, and (ii) an adaptive contrastive perturbation strategy that tailors
both on- and off-manifold exploration to class-specific manifold curvature and
alignment discrepancy. We further propose a cross-domain contrastive
consistency loss that encourages local semantic clusters to align while
preserving intra-domain diversity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results
on DomainNet, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks under both standard and
few-shot settings, with notable improvements in class-level alignment fidelity
and boundary robustness. GAMA++ sets a new standard for semantic geometry
alignment in transfer learning.

TL;DR: VET-DINO是一种自监督学习框架，利用医学影像中多视角数据的特性，提升模型对解剖结构的理解，并在兽医影像任务中取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中标记数据稀缺，而现有方法多依赖单图像的合成增强，未能充分利用多视角数据的优势。

Method: 提出VET-DINO框架，利用同一患者研究中的多视角兽医X光片，学习视角不变的解剖结构，并隐含3D理解。

Result: 在包含500万张兽医X光片的数据集上验证，显示多视角学习优于合成增强，并在下游任务中达到领先性能。

Conclusion: VET-DINO为医学影像自监督学习提供了新范式，强调利用领域特性而非简单迁移自然图像技术。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep
neural networks, particularly in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce.
While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single
images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic
of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the
same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same
patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures
and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our
approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine
studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and
downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs
leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic
augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific
properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

Motivation: 传统交互分割模型依赖手动提示（如边界框），而眼动追踪提供了一种更高效的替代方式。

Method: 引入眼动追踪作为交互分割的新模态，使用合成和真实眼动数据评估其在SAM-2和MedSAM-2中的表现。

Result: 眼动提示相比边界框更高效，但分割质量略低。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪可作为3D医学图像分割的补充输入方式，具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images
is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer
treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on
manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study,
we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive
segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image
segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with
SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to
bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach
with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential
of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical
image segmentation.

Motivation: 探索生成模型在通用感知任务中的潜力，尤其是如何利用其学习的对象边界和场景组合知识进行实例分割。

Method: 微调Stable Diffusion和MAE，使用实例着色损失在有限对象类型（室内家具和汽车）上进行训练。

Result: 模型在未见过的对象类型和风格上表现出色，性能接近或超过强监督模型SAM，尤其在精细结构和模糊边界上表现更优。

Conclusion: 生成模型具有跨类别和跨领域的泛化能力，无需大规模预训练即可实现高质量的实例分割。

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs,
generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene
compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for
general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE
(encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our
instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor
furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot
generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in
finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our
best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when
evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting
fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable
segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to
generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping
mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without
internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on
our website.

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示LVLM在面对特定语义概念时容易产生幻觉和错误的根本原因，以针对性提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 方法包括利用LLM进行语义概念的交叉与变异操作，生成图像描述，再通过T2I模型转换为视觉输入，最后量化LVLM的性能作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验在七种主流LVLM和两种多模态任务上验证了方法的有效性，并发现了LVLM的敏感语义概念。

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法能有效探索LVLM的敏感语义，为后续深入研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep
models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain
interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models
more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to
specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may
be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as
``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this
paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models
(LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and
various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently
search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs)
and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework.
Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation
operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models
into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each
input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as
reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs.
Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide
interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire
further in-depth research.

Motivation: 在资源受限环境中部署机器学习模型需要将大数据集蒸馏为小规模但信息丰富的合成数据集，现有方法在极端样本稀缺时效果不佳。

Method: 通过结合对比学习，在图像合成过程中显式最大化实例级特征区分度，生成更具信息量和多样性的合成样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在小规模合成数据集上显著提升模型性能，并改善合成图像的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在极端数据稀缺场景下优于现有蒸馏技术，尤其在特征表示和视觉质量上有显著提升。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such
as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands
distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative
synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly
Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's
training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While
demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail
to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method
integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly
maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more
informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are
significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating
contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained
on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more
effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual
fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation
techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.

TL;DR: LiveVLM是一个无需训练的框架，专为实时视频理解和交互设计，通过创新的流式KV缓存技术显著提升处理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型主要关注离线视频问答，忽视了内存使用和响应速度，而这些在实时应用中至关重要。

Method: LiveVLM采用流式KV缓存技术实时处理视频流，保留长期细节并消除冗余KV，同时通过压缩视频KV提升内存效率。

Result: 实验显示，LiveVLM在相同设备上处理44倍帧数，响应速度比现有方法快5倍，且性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: LiveVLM为实时视频理解提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了处理能力和响应速度。

Abstract: Recent developments in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have enabled
models to process long video sequences and demonstrate remarkable performance.
Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering,
neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various
real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and
robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a
training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video
understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process
videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative
streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain
long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses
to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses
video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while
improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed,
LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently
fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing
interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$
number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in
response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames,
while maintaining the same or better model performance.

Motivation: 依赖大规模标注数据集带来计算成本、存储和隐私问题，需要一种高效的数据剪枝方法以减少对大数据集的依赖。

Method: DiffProb通过分析样本预测概率剪除冗余数据，并引入辅助机制清理错误标签。

Result: 在CASIA-WebFace等数据集上，DiffProb可剪除50%数据，同时保持或提升验证准确率，且对不同架构和损失函数具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiffProb有效减少训练成本和数据量，为人脸识别提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Face recognition models have made substantial progress due to advances in
deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, reliance
on massive annotated datasets introduces challenges related to training
computational cost and data storage, as well as potential privacy concerns
regarding managing large face datasets. This paper presents DiffProb, the first
data pruning approach for the application of face recognition. DiffProb
assesses the prediction probabilities of training samples within each identity
and prunes the ones with identical or close prediction probability values, as
they are likely reinforcing the same decision boundaries, and thus contribute
minimally with new information. We further enhance this process with an
auxiliary cleaning mechanism to eliminate mislabeled and label-flipped samples,
boosting data quality with minimal loss. Extensive experiments on CASIA-WebFace
with different pruning ratios and multiple benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,
and IJB-C, demonstrate that DiffProb can prune up to 50% of the dataset while
maintaining or even, in some settings, improving the verification accuracies.
Additionally, we demonstrate DiffProb's robustness across different
architectures and loss functions. Our method significantly reduces training
cost and data volume, enabling efficient face recognition training and reducing
the reliance on massive datasets and their demanding management.

TL;DR: GS2E是一个基于3D高斯重建和物理模拟的大规模合成事件数据集，用于高保真事件视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件数据集通常从密集RGB视频合成，缺乏视角多样性和几何一致性，或依赖昂贵硬件。GS2E旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过3D高斯重建真实静态场景，结合物理模拟事件生成管道，包括自适应轨迹插值和事件对比阈值建模。

Result: 实验表明，GS2E在事件3D重建任务中表现出优越的泛化能力，适合作为事件视觉研究的基准。

Conclusion: GS2E为事件视觉研究提供了高质量、多样化的数据集，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce GS2E (Gaussian Splatting to Event), a large-scale synthetic
event dataset for high-fidelity event vision tasks, captured from real-world
sparse multi-view RGB images. Existing event datasets are often synthesized
from dense RGB videos, which typically lack viewpoint diversity and geometric
consistency, or depend on expensive, difficult-to-scale hardware setups. GS2E
overcomes these limitations by first reconstructing photorealistic static
scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and subsequently employing a novel,
physically-informed event simulation pipeline. This pipeline generally
integrates adaptive trajectory interpolation with physically-consistent event
contrast threshold modeling. Such an approach yields temporally dense and
geometrically consistent event streams under diverse motion and lighting
conditions, while ensuring strong alignment with underlying scene structures.
Experimental results on event-based 3D reconstruction demonstrate GS2E's
superior generalization capabilities and its practical value as a benchmark for
advancing event vision research.

Result: 在野外数据集上实现最先进的性能，显著提升渲染保真度、效率和存储优化。

Conclusion: R3GS通过创新技术有效解决了复杂场景中的重建与重定位问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose R3GS, a robust reconstruction and relocalization framework
tailored for unconstrained datasets. Our method uses a hybrid representation
during training. Each anchor combines a global feature from a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with a local feature encoded by the multiresolution hash
grids [2]. Subsequently, several shallow multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) predict
the attributes of each Gaussians, including color, opacity, and covariance. To
mitigate the adverse effects of transient objects on the reconstruction
process, we ffne-tune a lightweight human detection network. Once ffne-tuned,
this network generates a visibility map that efffciently generalizes to other
transient objects (such as posters, banners, and cars) with minimal need for
further adaptation. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by sky
regions in outdoor scenes, we propose an effective sky-handling technique that
incorporates a depth prior as a constraint. This allows the inffnitely distant
sky to be represented on the surface of a large-radius sky sphere,
signiffcantly reducing ffoaters caused by errors in sky reconstruction.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel relocalization method that remains robust to
changes in lighting conditions while estimating the camera pose of a given
image within the reconstructed 3DGS scene. As a result, R3GS significantly
enhances rendering ffdelity, improves both training and rendering efffciency,
and reduces storage requirements. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to baseline methods on in-the-wild datasets. The code will
be made open-source following the acceptance of the paper.

Result: 实验表明，BadSR在多种模型和数据集上实现了高攻击成功率，显著影响下游任务。

Conclusion: BadSR有效提升了背门攻击的隐蔽性和攻击效果，为超分辨率模型的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields,
researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have
demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through
data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an
attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a
normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor
attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned
low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this
problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the
pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications
to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images
generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve
the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a
backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic
algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack
success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting
downstream tasks.

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，该方法在姿态、表情和情感的控制准确性上优于现有方法，同时提高了生成多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法在身份条件下面部属性控制方面表现出色，具有更高的可控性和多样性。

Abstract: Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both
stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression,
and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled
high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over
non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from
these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two
lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose,
expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These
modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion
model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead.
Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention
between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages
identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing
controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along
with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion,
while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.

Conclusion: CEBSNet通过时间依赖性和背景噪声抑制，显著提升了变化检测的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Change detection, a critical task in remote sensing and computer vision, aims
to identify pixel-level differences between image pairs captured at the same
geographic area but different times. It faces numerous challenges such as
illumination variation, seasonal changes, background interference, and shooting
angles, especially with a large time gap between images. While current methods
have advanced, they often overlook temporal dependencies and overemphasize
prominent changes while ignoring subtle but equally important changes. To
address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{CEBSNet}, a novel
change-excited and background-suppressed network with temporal dependency
modeling for change detection. During the feature extraction, we utilize a
simple Channel Swap Module (CSM) to model temporal dependency, reducing
differences and noise. The Feature Excitation and Suppression Module (FESM) is
developed to capture both obvious and subtle changes, maintaining the integrity
of change regions. Additionally, we design a Pyramid-Aware Spatial-Channel
Attention module (PASCA) to enhance the ability to detect change regions at
different sizes and focus on critical regions. We conduct extensive experiments
on three common street view datasets and two remote sensing datasets, and our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在五个数据集的三个任务上，SoftHGNN显著提升了性能，高效捕捉了高阶关联。

Conclusion: SoftHGNN通过软超边和动态分配机制，为视觉识别任务提供了一种高效且通用的超图计算方法。

Abstract: Visual recognition relies on understanding both the semantics of image tokens
and the complex interactions among them. Mainstream self-attention methods,
while effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture
high-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from
redundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling
high-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these
limitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on
static and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant
hyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of
visual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural
Networks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation,
to make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our
framework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is
associated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than
hard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is
achieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity
measurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates
semantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft
hyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when
scaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge
selection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along
with a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization.
Experimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that
SoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes,
achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Leveraging the power of multimodal large language models (LLMs) offers a
promising approach to enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of morphing
attack detection (MAD), especially in real-world biometric applications. This
work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection
(D-MAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ
multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize
these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce
failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our
contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD
using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response
reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in

*Bernardin Ligan,Khalide Jbilou,Fahd Kalloubi,Ahmed Ratnani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效微调方法KronA+，用于将多光谱基础模型SpectralGPT适配到高光谱图像分类任务，显著减少了参数和存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）分类任务中，现有基础模型多为多光谱设计，直接微调需大量资源。

Method: 探索了多种参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，包括LoRA、KronA、LoKr和LoRA+，并提出了改进的KronA+。

Result: 在五个数据集上表现优异，KronA+仅需0.056%可训练参数和0.2MB存储，性能接近全微调。

Conclusion: KronA+是最高效的PEFT方法，为高光谱分类提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success across diverse domains,
including remote sensing (RS), thanks to their versatility and strong
generalization abilities. However, most RS foundation models are designed for
multispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of
spectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream
tasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In
this paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a
multispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).
We explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank
Kronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for
low-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce
KronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We
evaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing
competitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning
(FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral
foundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the
training epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar
performance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds
only approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT
method tested.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对扩散模型的新型主动防御策略，通过对抗攻击预先保护面部图像，避免被用于深度伪造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型已成为高质量深度伪造的主流框架，但现有对抗保护方法主要针对传统生成架构（如GANs、AEs、VAEs），无法应对扩散模型的独特挑战。

Method: 提出了一种主动防御策略，通过对抗攻击预先保护面部图像，解决了现有方法依赖特定模型架构和全局扰动策略的局限性。

Result: 该方法能够有效抵御多样化的扩散模型深度伪造攻击，并针对面部区域进行特异性保护。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩散模型深度伪造提供了一种更有效的主动防御方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: The proliferation of diffusion-based deepfake technologies poses significant
risks for unauthorized and unethical facial image manipulation. While
traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection
methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through
adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being
exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection
methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs,
VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models,
which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes.
Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance
on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against
the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations.
Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that
inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in
deepfakes.

Conclusion: 该方法有望广泛应用于骑行者检测算法的性能评估，推动自动驾驶中更鲁棒的道路用户检测方法的发展。

Abstract: Road safety is a critical challenge, particularly for cyclists, who are among
the most vulnerable road users. This study aims to enhance road safety by
proposing a novel benchmark for bicycle occlusion level classification using
advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing a parts-based detection model,
images are annotated and processed through a custom image detection pipeline. A
novel method of bicycle occlusion level is proposed to objectively quantify the
visibility and occlusion level of bicycle semantic parts. The findings indicate
that the model robustly quantifies the visibility and occlusion level of
bicycles, a significant improvement over the subjective methods used by the
current state of the art. Widespread use of the proposed methodology will
facilitate the accurate performance reporting of cyclist detection algorithms
for occluded cyclists, informing the development of more robust vulnerable road
user detection methods for autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在安全关键场景中的可靠性问题，发现模型在识别真实紧急情况时表现良好，但对安全场景存在高误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs在安全关键应用中的可靠性，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 通过VERI数据集（200张图像，100对对比图像）和两阶段评估协议（风险识别和紧急响应），评估14个VLMs的表现。

Result: 模型在识别真实紧急情况时成功率为70-100%，但对安全场景的误报率达31-96%，且存在系统性过度反应问题。

Conclusion: 模型规模的增加无法解决这些问题，需针对性改进VLMs在视觉误导场景中的上下文安全评估能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
understanding visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical contexts
remains under-explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition
Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100
contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but
safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative
refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency
response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies,
accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic
overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100
percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms,
misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios
failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias
manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of
errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings
highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model
scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety
assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义地图系统缺乏在线操作时构建开放词汇语义地图的灵活性，且视觉语言模型尚未实现3D空间理解。

Method: 通过在线实例级语义嵌入融合和分层对象关联，结合GPU加速几何重建与开放词汇模型。

Result: 系统在零样本3D实例检索、分割和物体检测等任务中表现优异，支持未见物体推理和自然语言查询。

Conclusion: 该框架为通用3D场景理解提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Mapping and understanding complex 3D environments is fundamental to how
autonomous systems perceive and interact with the physical world, requiring
both precise geometric reconstruction and rich semantic comprehension. While
existing 3D semantic mapping systems excel at reconstructing and identifying
predefined object instances, they lack the flexibility to efficiently build
semantic maps with open-vocabulary during online operation. Although recent
vision-language models have enabled open-vocabulary object recognition in 2D
images, they haven't yet bridged the gap to 3D spatial understanding. The
critical challenge lies in developing a training-free unified system that can
simultaneously construct accurate 3D maps while maintaining semantic
consistency and supporting natural language interactions in real time. In this
paper, we develop a zero-shot framework that seamlessly integrates
GPU-accelerated geometric reconstruction with open-vocabulary vision-language
models through online instance-level semantic embedding fusion, guided by
hierarchical object association with spatial indexing. Our training-free system
achieves superior performance through incremental processing and unified
geometric-semantic updates, while robustly handling 2D segmentation
inconsistencies. The proposed general-purpose 3D scene understanding framework
can be used for various tasks including zero-shot 3D instance retrieval,
segmentation, and object detection to reason about previously unseen objects
and interpret natural language queries. The project page is available at

Abstract: We present the P$^3$ dataset, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for building
vectorization, constructed from aerial LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution
aerial imagery, and vectorized 2D building outlines, collected across three
continents. The dataset contains over 10 billion LiDAR points with
decimeter-level accuracy and RGB images at a ground sampling distance of 25
centimeter. While many existing datasets primarily focus on the image modality,
P$^3$ offers a complementary perspective by also incorporating dense 3D
information. We demonstrate that LiDAR point clouds serve as a robust modality
for predicting building polygons, both in hybrid and end-to-end learning
frameworks. Moreover, fusing aerial LiDAR and imagery further improves accuracy
and geometric quality of predicted polygons. The P$^3$ dataset is publicly

TL;DR: RichCount通过两阶段训练策略提升零样本计数模型对未见类别的处理能力，通过增强文本特征和图像特征的关联实现更准确的计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过添加新提示无法实现文本与视觉特征的充分对齐，限制了零样本计数模型的泛化能力。

Method: RichCount采用两阶段训练策略：1）通过前馈网络和适配器增强文本特征；2）将优化后的编码器应用于计数任务。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，RichCount实现了零样本计数的最高性能，显著提升了对未见类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RichCount通过特征对齐超越了简单的提示扩展，为开放世界场景中的零样本计数提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories
requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve
the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting.
We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations,
employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and
strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves
zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1)
enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on
text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and
(2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective
generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner,
RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature
alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and
significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 在遥感等领域，视觉特征提取可通过多模态图像（如RGB、多光谱和合成孔径雷达）提升场景理解能力，从而改进VQA任务。

Method: 提出TAMMI数据集，包含多模态图像和多样化问题；设计MM-RSVQA模型，基于VisualBERT实现多模态与文本的可训练融合。

Result: 初步实验在TAMMI数据集上达到65.56%的准确率，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多分辨率VQA任务开辟了新方向，适用于医学影像等其他多模态领域。

Abstract: The extraction of visual features is an essential step in Visual Question
Answering (VQA). Building a good visual representation of the analyzed scene is
indeed one of the essential keys for the system to be able to correctly
understand the latter in order to answer complex questions. In many fields such
as remote sensing, the visual feature extraction step could benefit
significantly from leveraging different image modalities carrying complementary
spectral, spatial and contextual information. In this work, we propose to add
multiple image modalities to VQA in the particular context of remote sensing,
leading to a novel task for the computer vision community. To this end, we
introduce a new VQA dataset, named TAMMI (Text and Multi-Modal Imagery) with
diverse questions on scenes described by three different modalities (very high
resolution RGB, multi-spectral imaging data and synthetic aperture radar).
Thanks to an automated pipeline, this dataset can be easily extended according
to experimental needs. We also propose the MM-RSVQA (Multi-modal
Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering) model, based on
VisualBERT, a vision-language transformer, to effectively combine the multiple
image modalities and text through a trainable fusion process. A preliminary
experimental study shows promising results of our methodology on this
challenging dataset, with an accuracy of 65.56% on the targeted VQA task. This
pioneering work paves the way for the community to a new multi-modal
multi-resolution VQA task that can be applied in other imaging domains (such as
medical imaging) where multi-modality can enrich the visual representation of a
scene. The dataset and code are available at https://tammi.sylvainlobry.com/.

Abstract: Machine learning and computer vision methods have a major impact on the study
of natural animal behavior, as they enable the (semi-)automatic analysis of
vast amounts of video data. Mice are the standard mammalian model system in
most research fields, but the datasets available today to refine such methods
focus either on simple or social behaviors. In this work, we present a video
dataset of individual mice solving complex mechanical puzzles, so-called
lockboxes. The more than 110 hours of total playtime show their behavior
recorded from three different perspectives. As a benchmark for frame-level
action classification methods, we provide human-annotated labels for all videos
of two different mice, that equal 13% of our dataset. Our keypoint (pose)
tracking-based action classification framework illustrates the challenges of
automated labeling of fine-grained behaviors, such as the manipulation of
objects. We hope that our work will help accelerate the advancement of
automated action and behavior classification in the computational neuroscience
community. Our dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers的高计算和资源需求是主要挑战，而传统MoE方法需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 分两阶段从预训练模型的MLP层提取专家子网络：先聚类输出激活模式，再提取对应子网络。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k任务中，提取的专家子网络无需大量微调即可恢复98%性能，同时减少36%计算量和32%模型大小。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了Vision Transformers的计算和资源需求，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have emerged as the state-of-the-art models in various
Computer Vision tasks, but their high computational and resource demands pose
significant challenges. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can make these models
more efficient, they often require costly retraining or even training from
scratch. Recent developments aim to reduce these computational costs by
leveraging pretrained networks. These have been shown to produce sparse
activation patterns in the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) of the encoder
blocks, allowing for conditional activation of only relevant subnetworks for
each sample. Building on this idea, we propose a new method to construct MoE
variants from pretrained models. Our approach extracts expert subnetworks from
the model's MLP layers post-training in two phases. First, we cluster output
activations to identify distinct activation patterns. In the second phase, we
use these clusters to extract the corresponding subnetworks responsible for
producing them. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that these
extracted experts can perform surprisingly well out of the box and require only
minimal fine-tuning to regain 98% of the original performance, all while
reducing MACs and model size, by up to 36% and 32% respectively.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型在干净数据集上表现优异，但在真实临床图像中的噪声和失真条件下性能未经验证，亟需评估和改进。

Method: 引入MediMeta-C和MedMNIST-C基准测试，提出RobustMedCLIP方法，通过少量样本微调增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明现有MVLMs在失真条件下性能显著下降，RobustMedCLIP通过低秩适应和少量样本微调提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多样化训练和鲁棒适应策略的必要性，为医学视觉语言模型的实际应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MVLMs) have achieved par excellence
generalization in medical image analysis, yet their performance under noisy,
corrupted conditions remains largely untested. Clinical imaging is inherently
susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations
predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e.,
the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this
gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically
applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets.
Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness
evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual
encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to
enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we
benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that
existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with
domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient
low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while
preserving generalization across modalities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为TimeCausality的新基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在时间维度上的因果推理能力，发现当前开源VLMs在此任务上表现显著落后于闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在时间因果推理（如物体状态变化）上的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计TimeCausality基准，评估VLMs在时间因果推理任务上的表现。

Result: 当前开源VLMs在TimeCausality上表现显著落后于闭源模型（如GPT-4o），且GPT-4o在此任务上的表现也明显下降。

Conclusion: 时间因果推理是VLM发展中需重点关注的方向，开源社区需进一步努力提升此能力。

Abstract: Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations
of objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human
aging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal
perception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a
deeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the
current powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about
temporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
causal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our
TimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have
achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on
various standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly
behind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors.
Furthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality
compared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical
need to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of
VLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM
community moving forward. Code and Data are available at

Result: 在V*基准测试中，模型在8种分辨率下平均提升5%，证明了CoF的有效性。

Conclusion: CoF方法显著提升了视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力，有助于实际应用中的高效部署。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
variety of computer vision tasks. However, the multimodal reasoning capability
has not been fully explored in existing models. In this paper, we propose a
Chain-of-Focus (CoF) method that allows VLMs to perform adaptive focusing and
zooming in on key image regions based on obtained visual cues and the given
questions, achieving efficient multimodal reasoning. To enable this CoF
capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we
construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent
designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with
different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the
Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome
accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling
further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human
priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On
the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model
outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to
4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating
the more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.

Result: 在两个手语翻译基准测试中优于现有无注释方法，与基于注释的方法结果相当。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了手语注释稀缺问题，提升了手语翻译的实用性。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to map sign language videos to spoken
language text. A common approach relies on gloss annotations as an intermediate
representation, decomposing SLT into two sub-tasks: video-to-gloss recognition
and gloss-to-text translation. While effective, this paradigm depends on
expert-annotated gloss labels, which are costly and rarely available in
existing datasets, limiting its scalability. To address this challenge, we
propose a gloss-free pseudo gloss generation framework that eliminates the need
for human-annotated glosses while preserving the structured intermediate
representation. Specifically, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with a few
example text-gloss pairs using in-context learning to produce draft sign
glosses from spoken language text. To enhance the correspondence between
LLM-generated pseudo glosses and the sign sequences in video, we correct the
ordering in the pseudo glosses for better alignment via a weakly supervised
learning process. This reordering facilitates the incorporation of auxiliary
alignment objectives, and allows for the use of efficient supervision via a
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We train our SLT mode, which
consists of a vision encoder and a translator, through a three-stage pipeline,
which progressively narrows the modality gap between sign language and spoken
language. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms previous
state-of-the-art gloss-free frameworks on two SLT benchmarks and achieves
competitive results compared to gloss-based methods.

Abstract: Generating hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images through spectral
reconstruction can significantly reduce the cost of HSI acquisition. In this
paper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network
(FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate
the full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot
manner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process,
predicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach
for predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN
establishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an
atomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information
from neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image
at the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data.
Moreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a
pixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation
process, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused
by reflectance differences. Through extensive experimentation across different
datasets, FRN achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

### [73] [Stronger ViTs With Octic Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15441)
*David Nordström,Johan Edstedt,Fredrik Kahl,Georg Bökman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于八面体群等变性的Vision Transformers（ViTs）新架构，称为octic ViTs，通过实验证明其在计算效率和性能上的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers（ViTs）是目前计算机视觉领域的主流架构，但其在图像块上的权重共享仍可进一步优化。本文旨在通过引入八面体群（反射和90度旋转）等变性作为额外的归纳偏置，提升ViTs的性能和效率。

Method: 提出了octic ViTs架构，采用八面体群等变层，并在DeiT-III和DINOv2框架下进行了监督学习和自监督学习的实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，octic ViTs显著降低了计算成本（ViT-H的FLOPs减少约40%），同时提升了分类和分割任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入八面体群等变性，octic ViTs在保持ViTs优势的同时，进一步提高了计算效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Recent efforts at scaling computer vision models have established Vision
Transformers (ViTs) as the leading architecture. ViTs incorporate weight
sharing over image patches as an important inductive bias. In this work, we
show that ViTs benefit from incorporating equivariance under the octic group,
i.e., reflections and 90-degree rotations, as a further inductive bias. We
develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and
put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through
extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show
that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also
improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in
FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and
segmentation results.

*Ziqiang Xu,Qi Dai,Tian Xie,Yifan Yang,Kai Qiu,DongDong Chen,Zuxuan Wu,Chong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaRL是一种基于规则强化学习的框架，用于优化意图驱动视频理解中的帧选择，无需昂贵标注，性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法依赖启发式或伪标注，成本高且扩展性差，ViaRL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用规则强化学习，通过下游模型答案准确性作为奖励信号，训练帧选择器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在Needle QA上提升近15%。

Conclusion: ViaRL有效且可扩展，适用于多样化视频理解任务。

Abstract: Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on
relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however,
video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals
to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on
heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly
and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven
video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform
alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component
undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL
utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train
a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive
annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME,
LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior
temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video
understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably,
ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which
is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one
of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

Result: 提供了概念擦除方法的深入见解和实用指南，为内容安全研究奠定基础。

Conclusion: 研究推动了扩散模型内容安全的理解，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have gained widespread application across
various domains, demonstrating remarkable creative potential. However, the
strong generalization capabilities of diffusion models can inadvertently lead
to the generation of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, posing significant risks
to their safe deployment. While several concept erasure methods have been
proposed to mitigate the issue associated with NSFW content, a comprehensive
evaluation of their effectiveness across various scenarios remains absent. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a full-pipeline toolkit specifically designed for
concept erasure and conduct the first systematic study of NSFW concept erasure
methods. By examining the interplay between the underlying mechanisms and
empirical observations, we provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for
the effective application of concept erasure methods in various real-world
scenarios, with the aim of advancing the understanding of content safety in
diffusion models and establishing a solid foundation for future research and
development in this critical area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Pura的高效隐私保护人脸识别方案，通过阈值Paillier加密系统实现非交互式架构，并设计了安全计算协议和并行计算机制，显著提升了识别速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别技术存在隐私泄露风险，现有隐私保护方案效率不足且未能完全解决隐私问题。

Method: 采用阈值Paillier加密系统设计非交互式架构，开发安全计算协议，并引入并行计算机制。

Result: Pura在保护隐私的同时，识别速度比现有技术快16倍。

Conclusion: Pura是一种高效且隐私保护充分的人脸识别解决方案。

Abstract: Face recognition is an effective technology for identifying a target person
by facial images. However, sensitive facial images raises privacy concerns.
Although privacy-preserving face recognition is one of potential solutions,
this solution neither fully addresses the privacy concerns nor is efficient
enough. To this end, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving solution for
face recognition, named Pura, which sufficiently protects facial privacy and
supports face recognition over encrypted data efficiently. Specifically, we
propose a privacy-preserving and non-interactive architecture for face
recognition through the threshold Paillier cryptosystem. Additionally, we
carefully design a suite of underlying secure computing protocols to enable
efficient operations of face recognition over encrypted data directly.
Furthermore, we introduce a parallel computing mechanism to enhance the
performance of the proposed secure computing protocols. Privacy analysis
demonstrates that Pura fully safeguards personal facial privacy. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that Pura achieves recognition speeds up to 16 times
faster than the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解创作者的误导意图对多模态虚假信息检测（MMD）至关重要，但现有系统缺乏对意图的深入建模。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过建模创作者的期望影响和执行计划，构建包含12,000个图像-标题对的数据集，涵盖误导和非误导意图。

Result: 评估显示当前视觉语言模型在识别误导意图上表现不足，依赖表面线索而非深层推理。

Conclusion: 研究强调了意图感知建模在MMD中的重要性，为开发具备深层推理能力的系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading
narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading
creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD)
systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce
an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by
explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired
influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct
DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs
aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both
misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and
textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks:
(1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3)
creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs
fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues
such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic
authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware
modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of
deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于光谱视角的RGB与热辐射数据融合方法（SGFNet），通过区分低频和高频特征提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB数据在低光照和遮挡条件下表现不佳，而融合热辐射数据能提升性能，但如何有效融合多模态特征仍具挑战。

Method: 提出SGFNet，通过光谱视角将多模态特征分为低频（场景上下文）和高频（模态细节），并显式建模高频特征交互。

Result: 在MFNet和PST900数据集上，SGFNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 光谱视角为多模态特征融合提供了新思路，SGFNet在语义分割中表现优异。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relying solely on RGB data often struggles in
challenging conditions such as low illumination and obscured views, limiting
its reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address
this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images
demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively
reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features
remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a
novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be
categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide
broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and
high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges
and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion
Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by
explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency,
modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种Squeeze-and-Recalibrate（SR）块，作为MIL模型中线性层的替代，解决了少样本学习中的过拟合和特征误判问题，同时减少了参数和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算病理学中专家标注稀缺的问题，同时克服少样本学习中的过拟合和特征误判，以及现有方法的复杂预处理和高计算成本。

Method: 设计了SR块，包含低秩可训练矩阵（SP）和冻结的随机重校准矩阵，以减少参数并保持几何结构。

Result: SR-MIL模型在实验中表现优于现有方法，参数更少且无需架构更改。

Conclusion: SR块为MIL模型提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案，理论保证其性能下限不低于标准MIL模型。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations
remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from
overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the
current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage
pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of
complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a
Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in
MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core
components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that
reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature
learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric
structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization
objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can
approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that
the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its
SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL
models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and no architectural changes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉-语言基础模型（如CLIP和ALIGN）在目标数据集分布和类别与预训练数据差异较大时，能否通过少量标注样本进行有效微调，并解决过拟合和泛化能力下降的问题。

Method: 提出PromptMargin方法，通过选择性增强策略补充少量训练样本，并使用多模态边界正则化器提高类间区分度。

Result: 在15个目标基准数据集上的实验表明，PromptMargin在分布偏移较大的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PromptMargin能够有效适应目标数据集，提升性能，尤其在分布差异较大的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are
pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization
to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we
take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target
datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these
models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target
dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging
due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not
been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such
models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on
various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a
target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further
fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by
analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we
propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such
large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively
tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main
modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the
few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training
in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin
for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer.
Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets,
with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the
effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art
approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

Motivation: 理解MCoT提升LVLMs性能的机制，填补研究空白。

Result: 不同形式的视觉思维对MCoT改进效果不同，视觉思维是输入图像与深层推理的中介。

Conclusion: 视觉思维为未来MCoT研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in
multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing
performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories:
(i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual
output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved
image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving
these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal
that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image
information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending
only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual
thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought
expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that
these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT
improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts,
finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image
and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual
information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further
breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Abstract: To overcome the constraints of the underwater environment and improve the
accuracy and robustness of underwater target detection models, this paper
develops a specialized dataset for underwater target detection and proposes an
efficient algorithm for underwater multi-target detection. A self-supervised
learning based on the SimSiam structure is employed for the pre-training of
underwater target detection network. To address the problems of low detection
accuracy caused by low contrast, mutual occlusion and dense distribution of
underwater targets in underwater object detection, a detection model suitable
for underwater target detection is proposed by introducing deformable
convolution and dilated convolution. The proposed detection model can obtain
more effective information by increasing the receptive field. In addition, the
regression loss function EIoU is introduced, which improves model performance
by separately calculating the width and height losses of the predicted box.
Experiment results show that the accuracy of the underwater target detection
has been improved by the proposed detector.

Method: 采用慢快策略进行视频表示，并引入TimePerceiver模块，以高效编码时间-空间信息。

Result: 实现了13倍视觉标记压缩（平均61标记/帧），在多个数据集上表现优异（如VideoMME 62.0%）。

Conclusion: Clapper有效解决了长短视频理解的平衡问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs
for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e.
capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and
long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained
details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual
information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our
empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer
severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when
compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To
enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose
Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation
and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient
temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method,
we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61
tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper
achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with
fewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the main approach to analyzing flow
field. However, the convergence and accuracy depend largely on mathematical
models of flow, numerical methods, and time consumption. Deep learning-based
analysis of flow filed provides an alternative. For the task of flow field
prediction, an improved Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Con-vLSTM) Neural
Network is proposed as the baseline network in consideration of the temporal
and spatial characteristics of flow field. Combining dynamic mesh technology
and User-Defined Function (UDF), numerical simulations of flow around a
circular cylinder were conducted. Flow field snapshots were used to sample data
from the cylinder's wake region at different time instants, constructing a flow
field dataset with sufficient volume and rich flow state var-iations. Residual
networks and attention mechanisms are combined with the standard ConvLSTM
model. Compared with the standard ConvLSTM model, the results demonstrate that
the improved ConvLSTM model can extract more temporal and spatial features
while having fewer parameters and shorter train-ing time.

Abstract: 3D semantic segmentation plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving and road
infrastructure analysis, yet state-of-the-art 3D models are prone to severe
domain shift when deployed across different datasets. We propose a novel
multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG)
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our approach first aligns Lidar scans
into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to
create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D
segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of
views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an
occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our
framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design
parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality
optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and
SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve
state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with
particularly large gains on large, static classes. Our code and dataset

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) employed for visual question-answering (VQA) in
autonomous driving often require substantial computational resources that pose
a challenge for their deployment in resource-constrained vehicles. To address
this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for
multi-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components
including a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism
for tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of
multi-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and
cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token
level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process
the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence
level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a
diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples
within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more
frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our
custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM
benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding
performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in
BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller
parameter count.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，AHNPL显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: AHNPL通过改进负样本生成和损失设计，有效解决了现有方法的不足，提升了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially
compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained
semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing
methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative
samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which
results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts
the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically
treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the
alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in
aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard
negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based
negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.
AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard
negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within
each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin
according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample
pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对水下实例分割的高效模型UWSAM，并发布了大规模数据集UIIS10K，通过知识蒸馏和自动提示生成技术显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏水下领域专业知识，现有模型（如SAM）在水下实例分割任务中表现受限，且计算需求较高。

Method: 提出数据集UIIS10K，并设计UWSAM模型，结合Mask GAT-based知识蒸馏方法和端到端水下提示生成器（EUPG）。

Result: 实验表明，UWSAM在多个水下实例数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UWSAM通过高效知识蒸馏和自动提示生成，解决了水下实例分割的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual
applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and
its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance
segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further
hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which
includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we
introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate
segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from
the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the
Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective
visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater
Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater
prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts,
thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for
efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model
is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and
codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Motivation: 大规模预训练视觉模型在专业领域表现不佳，需适应特定领域的视觉特征。

Method: 提出VP Lab框架，集成E-PEFT技术，实现参数和数据高效的视觉提示调整。

Result: 在Segment Anything Model上超越现有参数高效微调方法，mIoU提升50%。

Conclusion: VP Lab为快速、高效、交互式模型部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large-scale pretrained vision backbones have transformed computer vision by
providing powerful feature extractors that enable various downstream tasks,
including training-free approaches like visual prompting for semantic
segmentation. Despite their success in generic scenarios, these models often
fall short when applied to specialized technical domains where the visual
features differ significantly from their training distribution. To bridge this
gap, we introduce VP Lab, a comprehensive iterative framework that enhances
visual prompting for robust segmentation model development. At the core of VP
Lab lies E-PEFT, a novel ensemble of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
specifically designed to adapt our visual prompting pipeline to specific
domains in a manner that is both parameter- and data-efficient. Our approach
not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for
the Segment Anything Model (SAM), but also facilitates an interactive,
near-real-time loop, allowing users to observe progressively improving results
as they experiment within the framework. By integrating E-PEFT with visual
prompting, we demonstrate a remarkable 50\% increase in semantic segmentation
mIoU performance across various technical datasets using only 5 validated
images, establishing a new paradigm for fast, efficient, and interactive model
deployment in new, challenging domains. This work comes in the form of a
demonstration.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估MLLMs时缺乏对低级感知能力与高级推理协同作用的考量，且任务样本数据分布不一致。

Method: 构建Lens基准测试，包含三个递进任务层级（感知、理解、推理），每张图像配备多任务注释，数据来自社交媒体。

Conclusion: Lens为MLLMs提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advances
in integrating visual and linguistic information, yet their ability to reason
about complex and real-world scenarios remains limited. The existing benchmarks
are usually constructed in the task-oriented manner without guarantee that
different task samples come from the same data distribution, thus they often
fall short in evaluating the synergistic effects of lower-level perceptual
capabilities on higher-order reasoning. To lift this limitation, we contribute
Lens, a multi-level benchmark with 3.4K contemporary images and 60K+
human-authored questions covering eight tasks and 12 daily scenarios, forming
three progressive task tiers, i.e., perception, understanding, and reasoning.
One feature is that each image is equipped with rich annotations for all tasks.
Thus, this dataset intrinsically supports to evaluate MLLMs to handle
image-invariable prompts, from basic perception to compositional reasoning. In
addition, our images are manully collected from the social media, in which 53%
were published later than Jan. 2025. We evaluate 15+ frontier MLLMs such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, InternVL3-78B, GPT-4o and two reasoning models QVQ-72B-preview
and Kimi-VL. These models are released later than Dec. 2024, and none of them
achieve an accuracy greater than 60% in the reasoning tasks. Project page:

Result: 发现视觉数据集存在显著偏差，模型在良好曝光图像上也无法达到人类准确率，且对相机设置的微小变化敏感。

Conclusion: 研究强调了捕获条件对模型性能的重要性，并提供了新基准和实验结果以指导未来研究。

Abstract: Generalization of deep-learning-based (DL) computer vision algorithms to
various image perturbations is hard to establish and remains an active area of
research. The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured,
whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less
studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of
capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model
performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and
visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common
vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed,
ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of
objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled
camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show
the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we
conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our
results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models
trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed
images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute
variations of camera settings. Code and data can be found at

Abstract: Malocclusion is a major challenge in orthodontics, and its complex
presentation and diverse clinical manifestations make accurate localization and
diagnosis particularly important. Currently, one of the major shortcomings
facing the field of dental image analysis is the lack of large-scale,
accurately labeled datasets dedicated to malocclusion issues, which limits the
development of automated diagnostics in the field of dentistry and leads to a
lack of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. Therefore, in
this study, we propose the Oral and Maxillofacial Natural Images (OMNI)
dataset, a novel and comprehensive dental image dataset aimed at advancing the
study of analyzing dental images for issues of malocclusion. Specifically, the
dataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data
collection and annotated by professional dentists. In addition, we performed a
comprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based
methods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted
automated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental
results show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis
research of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in
this field. Our OMNI dataset and baseline code are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该研究首次将局部图像编辑检测任务重新定义为视觉语言理解问题，为多模态内容真实性领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial
for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion
models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations.
However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only
a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional
computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3)
No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection
techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation
pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited
image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models
and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision
Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image
classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that
fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets,
significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and
transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various
configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language
understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate
that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire
subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.

Motivation: 现有场景文本检测方法在学术基准上表现优异，但在实际应用中效果不佳，论文旨在解决这一性能差异问题。

Result: 论文提出了LTB基准和MAEDet方法，为长尾场景文本检测提供了新的评估标准和基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过JDL协议和LTB基准，论文为提升场景文本检测在实际应用中的泛化能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scene text detection has seen the emergence of high-performing methods that
excel on academic benchmarks. However, these detectors often fail to replicate
such success in real-world scenarios. We uncover two key factors contributing
to this discrepancy through extensive experiments. First, a \textit{Fine-tuning
Gap}, where models leverage \textit{Dataset-Specific Optimization} (DSO)
paradigm for one domain at the cost of reduced effectiveness in others, leads
to inflated performances on academic benchmarks. Second, the suboptimal
performance in practical settings is primarily attributed to the long-tailed
distribution of texts, where detectors struggle with rare and complex
categories as artistic or overlapped text. Given that the DSO paradigm might
undermine the generalization ability of models, we advocate for a
\textit{Joint-Dataset Learning} (JDL) protocol to alleviate the Fine-tuning
Gap. Additionally, an error analysis is conducted to identify three major
categories and 13 subcategories of challenges in long-tailed scene text, upon
which we propose a Long-Tailed Benchmark (LTB). LTB facilitates a comprehensive
evaluation of ability to handle a diverse range of long-tailed challenges. We
further introduce MAEDet, a self-supervised learning-based method, as a strong
baseline for LTB. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/LTB.

Result: 改进后的算法在传统准确率和不确定性准确率上平均优于基线MCD 2-3%，且校准效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提升深度学习模型在安全关键应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Knowing the uncertainty associated with the output of a deep neural network
is of paramount importance in making trustworthy decisions, particularly in
high-stakes fields like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems. Monte Carlo
Dropout (MCD) is a widely used method for uncertainty quantification, as it can
be easily integrated into various deep architectures. However, conventional MCD
often struggles with providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. To
address this, we introduce innovative frameworks that enhances MCD by
integrating different search solutions namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO),
Bayesian Optimization (BO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as an
uncertainty-aware loss function, thereby improving the reliability of
uncertainty quantification. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
different backbones, namely DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, on various
datasets, including Cats vs. Dogs, Myocarditis, Wisconsin, and a synthetic
dataset (Circles). Our proposed algorithm outperforms the MCD baseline by 2-3%
on average in terms of both conventional accuracy and uncertainty accuracy
while achieving significantly better calibration. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to enhance the trustworthiness of deep learning
models in safety-critical applications.

Result: 在多种病理任务中，性能平均提升41.7%，推理成本降低70.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架在提升推理准确性的同时，显著优化了计算效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest
due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized
treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods
exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle
complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological
images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their
practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches.
One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the
model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales,
directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other
branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images
based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing
computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks
such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection.
Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement
with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: 在Argoverse 2基准测试中，HAMF实现了最先进的运动预测性能。

Conclusion: HAMF通过轻量级架构，有效提升了运动预测的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving
systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future
trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the
extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road
layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature
encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion
forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene
context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and
future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and
map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal
future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified
Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and
cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate
future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the
Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and
correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the
accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2
benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves
state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight
architecture.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity underwater scenes remains a challenging task due
to light absorption, scattering, and limited visibility inherent in aquatic
environments. This paper presents an enhanced Gaussian Splatting-based
framework that improves both the visual quality and geometric accuracy of deep
underwater rendering. We propose decoupled learning for RGB channels, guided by
the physics of underwater attenuation, to enable more accurate colour
restoration. To address sparse-view limitations and improve view consistency,
we introduce a frame interpolation strategy with a novel adaptive weighting
scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function aimed at reducing noise
while preserving edges, which is essential for deep-sea content. We also
release a newly collected dataset, Submerged3D, captured specifically in
deep-sea environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with PSNR gains up to 1.90dB,
delivering superior perceptual quality and robustness, and offering promising

Abstract: The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI
to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable
descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse
interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations,
attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous
reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we
analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual
components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a
zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to
decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability
to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity
Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two
key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics
highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships.
Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate

Conclusion: 3DTown证明无需训练即可从单张图像生成高质量3D场景，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view
data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative,
generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential
role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have
achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene
generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and
low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free
framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single
top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based
generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware
3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry
generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions
and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked
rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while
maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome
resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D
supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show
that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,
Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and
texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation
is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.

Conclusion: IA-T2I框架有效解决了文本到图像生成中的知识不确定性问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but
they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is
uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to
generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the
character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem,
we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to
compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with
reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to
determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a
hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable
image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a
self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the
generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate
the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I,
where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but
rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt
to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have
an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.

TL;DR: VARD是一种基于强化学习的扩散模型优化方法，通过学习值函数和KL正则化提供密集监督，解决了现有方法在稳定性和效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在扩散模型中难以同时实现稳定、高效的微调，且对稀疏奖励的依赖导致生成质量不佳。

Method: 提出VARD方法，通过学习值函数预测中间状态的奖励期望，并结合KL正则化提供密集监督。

Result: 实验表明VARD能更好地指导轨迹生成，提高训练效率，并适用于复杂、不可微的奖励函数。

Conclusion: VARD为扩散模型提供了稳定、高效的强化学习优化方案，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools across various
domains, yet tailoring pre-trained models to exhibit specific desirable
properties remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable,
efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore,
their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during
intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To
address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required
throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced
Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function
predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses
this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision
throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the
pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via
backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates
better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the
applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex,
non-differentiable reward functions.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成数字人类视频时存在质量低、一致性和身份保持差的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一种新的交叉注意力机制（ISA），结合自定义的视频变分自编码器，训练了一个基于潜在扩散的模型。

Conclusion: ISA机制为数字人类视频生成提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Generating photorealistic videos of digital humans in a controllable manner
is crucial for a plethora of applications. Existing approaches either build on
methods that employ template-based 3D representations or emerging video
generation models but suffer from poor quality or limited consistency and
identity preservation when generating individual or multiple digital humans. In
this paper, we introduce a new interspatial attention (ISA) mechanism as a
scalable building block for modern diffusion transformer (DiT)--based video
generation models. ISA is a new type of cross attention that uses relative
positional encodings tailored for the generation of human videos. Leveraging a
custom-developed video variation autoencoder, we train a latent ISA-based
diffusion model on a large corpus of video data. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance for 4D human video synthesis, demonstrating
remarkable motion consistency and identity preservation while providing precise
control of the camera and body poses. Our code and model are publicly released

Conclusion: STAR-R1为多模态大语言模型和推理模型的研究提供了重要启示，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they lag significantly behind humans in
spatial reasoning. We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual
Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object
transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in
cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from
inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm
with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1
rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive
inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios.
Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its
unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work
provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning
models. The codes, model weights, and data will be publicly available at

Motivation: 旨在通过统一架构和算法设计，消除模态特定组件需求，提升多模态任务的性能和泛化能力。

Method: 采用统一扩散架构、混合长链思维微调策略和UniGRPO强化学习算法，实现跨模态无缝处理。

Result: MMaDA-8B在文本推理、多模态理解和文本生成图像任务中超越多个先进模型。

Conclusion: MMaDA为统一扩散架构提供了全面框架，有效缩小预训练与后训练间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce MMaDA, a novel class of multimodal diffusion foundation models
designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual
reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. The approach
is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion
architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic
design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This
architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data
types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning
strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning
reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy
facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)
stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the
outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm
specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified
reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and
generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental
results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities
as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like
LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in
multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image
generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the
gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion
architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and
development. We open-source our code and trained models at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于范例的图像着色中语义匹配不准确的问题，利用预训练扩散模型的自注意力模块实现更精确的语义对齐。

Method: 1. 双重注意力引导颜色转移：利用自注意力模块计算输入与参考图像的注意力图，实现语义匹配；2. 分类器无指导着色：结合颜色转移与非转移输出，提升着色质量。

Result: 在335对输入-参考图像上，FID为95.27（图像质量），SI-FID为5.51（参考保真度），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练扩散模型的自注意力模块和双重注意力机制，显著提升了图像着色的语义匹配和颜色质量。

Abstract: Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a
reference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to
corresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve
accurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention
module of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset
and exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose
a novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,
making two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color
transfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map
between the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic
correspondences. The color features from the reference image is then
transferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by
this attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the
corresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate
attention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more
precise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization
guidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred
and non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of
colorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference.
Specifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research,
achieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to
the reference). Our source code is available at

Motivation: SfM问题在理论和实践中具有重要意义，但现有方法缺乏系统性分类，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将SfM方法分为三类，根据其关注点（运动或结构）进行分类，并探讨其理论条件。

Result: 提出了新的分类视角，揭示了现有方法的共性与差异，并指出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文的分类为SfM研究提供了新视角，同时明确了问题的理论条件和未来可能的探索方向。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) refers to the problem of recovering both
structure (i.e., 3D coordinates of points in the scene) and motion (i.e.,
camera matrices) starting from point correspondences in multiple images. It has
attracted significant attention over the years, counting practical
reconstruction pipelines as well as theoretical results. This paper is
conceived as a conceptual review of SfM methods, which are grouped into three
main categories, according to which part of the problem - between motion and
structure - they focus on. The proposed taxonomy brings a new perspective on
existing SfM approaches as well as insights into open problems and possible
future research directions. Particular emphasis is given on identifying the
theoretical conditions that make SfM well posed, which depend on the problem
formulation that is being considered.

Result: ProxyV在提升效率的同时不损失性能，甚至在某些情况下带来性能提升。

Conclusion: ProxyV是一种灵活且高效的方法，可与令牌缩减方法结合进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant
computational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike
token reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and
study the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no
information loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained
vision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g.,
self-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly
with proper designs. We designed a series of experiments to discover and
progressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on
our findings, we propose ProxyV, a novel approach that utilizes proxy vision
tokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV
enhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable
performance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements.
Furthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination
with token reduction methods to boost efficiency further. The code will be made
public at this https://github.com/penghao-wu/ProxyV URL.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式类别提示，难以处理复杂或隐式查询，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出InstructCDS任务套件和EarthInstruct基准，开发无需训练的框架InstructSAM，结合大视觉语言模型和SAM2进行对象识别。

Result: InstructSAM在多项任务中表现优于基线方法，推理时间稳定，输出标记减少89%，运行时间降低32%。

Conclusion: 提出的任务、基准和方法为开发多功能对象识别系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for
large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing
open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues,
limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require
advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks,
including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation
(InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass
scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark
for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing
datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20
categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions.
Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we
propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object
recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret
user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal,
and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem.
By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM
efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence
thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses
specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant
inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and
overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We
believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective
approach will advance future research in developing versatile object
recognition systems.

Motivation: 探索开源模型在生成PDDL语言和计划方面的能力，弥补此前仅限闭源模型的局限。

Method: 设计并评估8种PDDL生成流程，包括语言包装、约束解码和反馈修正等方法。

Result: 反馈修正方法使性能提升一倍以上，而直观方法如语言包装或约束解码反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 反馈修正是提升开源LLM生成PDDL计划性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Using LLMs to generate formal planning languages such as PDDL that invokes
symbolic solvers to deterministically derive plans has been shown to outperform
generating plans directly. While this success has been limited to
closed-sourced models or particular LLM pipelines, we design and evaluate 8
different PDDL generation pipelines with open-source models under 50 billion
parameters previously shown to be incapable of this task. We find that
intuitive approaches such as using a high-resource language wrapper or
constrained decoding with grammar decrease performance, yet inference-time
scaling approaches such as revision with feedback from the solver and plan
validator more than double the performance.

Conclusion: 当前LLM训练范式存在根本性矛盾，需开发更具指令感知能力的推理模型。

Abstract: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive
performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to
natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in
mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent
tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability,
as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user
directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or
trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in
instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases.
Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover
obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings
highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate
the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and
data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

Method: 研究覆盖15种语言、7种任务难度和18个主题领域，分析语言混合的模式和影响，并通过约束解码实验验证推理语言选择对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，强制模型使用拉丁或汉字脚本推理能显著提高准确性，且语言混合现象与模型内部表征的脚本组成密切相关。

Conclusion: 语言混合反映了RLMs的潜在处理偏好，研究结果为优化多语言推理提供了实用建议，并为构建更可解释和适应性的RLMs开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) excel at complex tasks by leveraging a
chain-of-thought process to generate structured intermediate steps. However,
language mixing, i.e., reasoning steps containing tokens from languages other
than the prompt, has been observed in their outputs and shown to affect
performance, though its impact remains debated. We present the first systematic
study of language mixing in RLMs, examining its patterns, impact, and internal
causes across 15 languages, 7 task difficulty levels, and 18 subject areas, and
show how all three factors influence language mixing. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the choice of reasoning language significantly affects performance:
forcing models to reason in Latin or Han scripts via constrained decoding
notably improves accuracy. Finally, we show that the script composition of
reasoning traces closely aligns with that of the model's internal
representations, indicating that language mixing reflects latent processing
preferences in RLMs. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing
multilingual reasoning and open new directions for controlling reasoning
languages to build more interpretable and adaptable RLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注最终模型表现，但对预训练过程中多语言事实记忆和跨语言一致性的发展缺乏探索。

Method: 以OLMo-7B为案例，追踪预训练过程中事实记忆和跨语言一致性的变化，分析频率和跨语言迁移的影响。

Result: 事实频率是主要驱动因素，高频事实更易被正确记忆；跨语言迁移对低频非英语事实有帮助，尤其在早期阶段。

Conclusion: 多语言事实获取通过频率驱动（主导）和跨语言迁移（辅助）两种途径实现，后者主要涉及命名实体关系。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of recalling multilingual factual
knowledge present in their pretraining data. However, most studies evaluate
only the final model, leaving the development of factual recall and
crosslingual consistency throughout pretraining largely unexplored. In this
work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during
pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy
and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this
improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining
corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly,
regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages
can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances
largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an
effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We
pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge
acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and
language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and
typically constrained to relation types involving named entities. We release
our code and data to facilitate further research at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的生成方法Mixture of Inputs (MoI)，通过结合离散生成的token和丢弃的token分布信息，提升自回归生成的质量和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自回归生成中，模型丢弃了token分布信息，仅传递离散token，导致信息损失。MoI旨在保留这些信息以提升生成效果。

Method: MoI在生成token后，通过贝叶斯估计将token分布作为先验，采样token作为观测，生成连续后验期望作为新输入。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和博士级QA任务中，MoI显著提升了多个模型的性能，且无需额外训练和计算开销。

Conclusion: MoI通过保留token分布信息，有效提升了自回归生成的质量和推理能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token
distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution,
passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's
rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method
for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard
paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token
with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a
Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the
sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector
with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows
the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the
generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning
capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA
tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including
QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional
training and negligible computational overhead.

*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEPS是一个评估框架，用于衡量模型在单个提示中同时遗忘和保留信息的能力，解决了现有遗忘方法在混合查询场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘指标未能捕捉真实场景中遗忘和保留查询共存的情况，导致评估不全面。

Method: 提出Mixed Prompt (MP)遗忘策略，将遗忘和保留查询整合到统一训练目标中。

Result: MP策略显著提升了遗忘效果，在复杂场景中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SEPS和MP策略为机器遗忘提供了更有效的评估和实现方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large
Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining
essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model
correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to
capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation.
In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making
mixed-query evaluation crucial.
  We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's
ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through
extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure
modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning
indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query
appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios,
leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address
these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that
integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective.
Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating
robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain
queries in a single prompt.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出类似人类的性格特征，并提出了分布式人格框架，发现LLMs的性格是动态且输入驱动的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社交和认知领域的参与度增加，研究其是否具备类似人类的性格特征，以及传统人格评估工具的适用性。

Method: 通过三个实证研究：测试-重测稳定性分析、跨变体一致性分析及角色扮演中的人格保留研究。

Result: LLMs的性格表现具有高变异性、输入敏感性和低内部一致性，缺乏长期稳定性。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出流动且外部依赖的性格模式，为构建LLM特定人格框架和推动人机交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, becoming active participants in social
and cognitive domains. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit
personality-like traits and how these traits compare with human personality,
focusing on the applicability of conventional personality assessment tools. A
behavior-based approach was used across three empirical studies. Study 1
examined test-retest stability and found that LLMs show higher variability and
are more input-sensitive than humans, lacking long-term stability. Based on
this, we propose the Distributed Personality Framework, conceptualizing LLM
traits as dynamic and input-driven. Study 2 analyzed cross-variant consistency
in personality measures and found LLMs' responses were highly sensitive to item
wording, showing low internal consistency compared to humans. Study 3 explored
personality retention during role-playing, showing LLM traits are shaped by
prompt and parameter settings. These findings suggest that LLMs express fluid,
externally dependent personality patterns, offering insights for constructing
LLM-specific personality frameworks and advancing human-AI interaction. This
work contributes to responsible AI development and extends the boundaries of
personality psychology in the age of intelligent systems.

*Xi Wang,Jiaqian Hu,Safinah Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAATS是一个多代理自动翻译系统，利用MQM框架进行细粒度错误检测和翻译优化，显著优于传统单代理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单代理翻译系统在语义准确性和上下文保真度方面的不足，通过多代理分工协作提升翻译质量。

Method: 使用多个专注于不同MQM类别的AI代理（如准确性、流畅性、风格等），并通过合成代理整合标注以迭代优化翻译。

Result: 在多种语言对和LLM上表现优于零样本和单代理基线，尤其在语义准确性、本地化适应和远距离语言对中表现突出。

Conclusion: MAATS通过模块化代理与可解释的MQM维度对齐，缩小了黑盒LLM与人工翻译流程之间的差距，提升了翻译的语义和上下文保真度。

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages
the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal
for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI
agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency,
Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the
annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with
conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs),
MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically
significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels
particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically
distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in
multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and
context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable
MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human
translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic
and contextual fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）框架，用于在微调过程中压缩预训练大型语言模型（LLMs），提升压缩效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练LLMs的高秩特性及缺乏预训练数据访问权，使得其在下游任务中的压缩具有挑战性。

Method: 采用低秩张量压缩技术，结合稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）框架，在微调过程中实现全模型压缩。

Result: 实验表明，Saten在张量化语言模型中提升了准确性和压缩效率，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Saten框架为资源受限设备上高效部署LLMs提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression
techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for
over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress
pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training)
remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the
lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank
tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks
(Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full
model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both
accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语构音障碍语音数据稀缺问题，提升ASR模型在构音障碍语音识别中的表现。

Method: 利用英语构音障碍语音（UASpeech）微调语音转换模型，生成非英语构音障碍语音（FLEURS），用于微调多语言ASR模型（MMS）。

Result: 在西班牙语、意大利语和泰米尔语数据集上，该方法显著优于现成MMS模型和传统数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 生成的语音能有效模拟构音障碍特征，显著提升ASR模型性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging
due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this,
we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech)
to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it
to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like
speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model,
Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech
recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE
(Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion
significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional
augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and
subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated
speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的表现高度依赖提示策略，但现有评估多关注性能而忽视效率。作者认为平衡性能和token使用的效率更具实际意义。

Method: 提出Big-$O_{tok}$理论框架描述提示策略的token增长，并引入Token Cost（每性能的token消耗）作为实证指标，分析常见提示策略。

Result: 研究发现，增加token使用会导致性能回报急剧下降，验证了Big-$O_{tok}$框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 效率感知的评估是必要的，Big-$O_{tok}$和Token Cost为提示策略的优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse tasks. However, their task effectiveness is heavily
dependent on the prompting strategy used to elicit output, which can vary
widely in both performance and token usage. While task performance is often
used to determine prompting strategy success, we argue that
efficiency--balancing performance and token usage--can be a more practical
metric for real-world utility. To enable this, we propose Big-$O_{tok}$, a
theoretical framework for describing the token usage growth of prompting
strategies, and analyze Token Cost, an empirical measure of tokens per
performance. We apply these to several common prompting strategies and find
that increased token usage leads to drastically diminishing performance
returns. Our results validate the Big-$O_{tok}$ analyses and reinforce the need
for efficiency-aware evaluations.

TL;DR: TreeDebater是一个新颖的辩论框架，通过引入Rehearsal Tree和Debate Flow Tree解决竞争性辩论中的时间限制和互动性问题，并在实验中优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性辩论中，时间限制和辩论互动的复杂性是主要挑战，需要一种能动态调整策略的框架。

Method: 提出TreeDebater框架，包含Rehearsal Tree（评估论点强度）和Debate Flow Tree（跟踪辩论状态），并结合时间分配和观众反馈优化辩论策略。

Result: 实验表明，TreeDebater在多智能体辩论系统中表现最佳，且其时间分配策略与人类专家一致。

Conclusion: TreeDebater通过树结构和动态策略优化，显著提升了竞争性辩论的效果。

Abstract: Winning competitive debates requires sophisticated reasoning and argument
skills. There are unique challenges in the competitive debate: (1) The time
constraints force debaters to make strategic choices about which points to
pursue rather than covering all possible arguments; (2) The persuasiveness of
the debate relies on the back-and-forth interaction between arguments, which a
single final game status cannot evaluate. To address these challenges, we
propose TreeDebater, a novel debate framework that excels in competitive
debate. We introduce two tree structures: the Rehearsal Tree and Debate Flow
Tree. The Rehearsal Tree anticipates the attack and defenses to evaluate the
strength of the claim, while the Debate Flow Tree tracks the debate status to
identify the active actions. TreeDebater allocates its time budget among
candidate actions and uses the speech time controller and feedback from the
simulated audience to revise its statement. The human evaluation on both the
stage-level and the debate-level comparison shows that our TreeDebater
outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-agent debate system. Further
investigation shows that TreeDebater shows better strategies in limiting time
to important debate actions, aligning with the strategies of human debate
experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文学习（ICL）的框架，用于提升语音识别模型对陌生说话者和语言变体的适应性，实验表明仅需少量示例即可显著降低词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音识别模型是否能像人类一样通过少量示例适应陌生说话者和语言变体。

Method: 引入了一个可扩展的框架，利用交错的任务提示和音频-文本对进行上下文学习（ICL）。

Result: 仅需12个示例（约50秒）即可将词错误率相对降低19.7%，尤其在低资源变体中效果显著。

Conclusion: ICL框架在提升语音识别鲁棒性方面表现出与人类相似的适应性，但仍存在某些变体的性能差距。

Abstract: Human listeners readily adjust to unfamiliar speakers and language varieties
through exposure, but do these adaptation benefits extend to state-of-the-art
spoken language models? We introduce a scalable framework that allows for
in-context learning (ICL) in Phi-4 Multimodal using interleaved task prompts
and audio-text pairs, and find that as few as 12 example utterances (~50
seconds) at inference time reduce word error rates by a relative 19.7% (1.2
pp.) on average across diverse English corpora. These improvements are most
pronounced in low-resource varieties, when the context and target speaker
match, and when more examples are provided--though scaling our procedure yields
diminishing marginal returns to context length. Overall, we find that our novel
ICL adaptation scheme (1) reveals a similar performance profile to human
listeners, and (2) demonstrates consistent improvements to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) robustness across diverse speakers and language backgrounds.
While adaptation succeeds broadly, significant gaps remain for certain
varieties, revealing where current models still fall short of human
flexibility. We release our prompts and code on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在内部状态跟踪任务中的能力，尤其是其对状态转移动态的建模效果。

Method: 在三个领域（Box Tracking、Abstract DFA Sequences、Complex Text Games）评估LLMs的状态预测准确性，并通过激活修补技术识别关键注意力头。

Result: LLMs在低复杂度任务中表现尚可（如GPT-2 XL达70%准确率），但随状态空间增大或转移稀疏性增加，准确性显著下降（如低于30%）。关键注意力头被发现负责状态信息传播，但状态-动作联合推理较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs的状态跟踪能力源于分布式交互而非显式符号计算，未来需改进状态-动作联合推理机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring
internal state tracking, yet their ability to model state transition dynamics
remains poorly understood. We evaluate how well LLMs capture deterministic
state dynamics across 3 domains: Box Tracking, Abstract DFA Sequences, and
Complex Text Games, each formalizable as a finite-state system. Across tasks,
we find that next-state prediction accuracy degrades with increasing
state-space size and sparse transitions. GPT-2 XL reaches about 70% accuracy in
low-complexity settings but drops below 30% when the number of boxes or states
exceeds 5 or 10, respectively. In DFA tasks, Pythia-1B fails to exceed 50%
accuracy when the number of states is > 10 and transitions are < 30. Through
activation patching, we identify attention heads responsible for propagating
state information: GPT-2 XL Layer 22 Head 20, and Pythia-1B Heads at Layers 10,
11, 12, and 14. While these heads successfully move relevant state features,
action information is not reliably routed to the final token, indicating weak
joint state-action reasoning. Our results suggest that state tracking in LLMs
emerges from distributed interactions of next-token heads rather than explicit
symbolic computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs在面对与定义冲突的用户提示时的行为，例如“画一个有两个角的独角兽”，并量化模型在概念不一致性下的表现。

Method: 方法包括定义概念不一致性，设计角色扮演实验，提出三个行为指标（abstention rate, conditional accuracy, answer rate），并通过探测实验分析原因。

Result: 结果显示模型在角色死亡后未能有效停止回答，且准确性下降。原因包括对“死亡”状态编码不可靠以及角色扮演导致的时间表征偏移。

Conclusion: 结论指出概念不一致性会导致模型行为异常，并提出了改进模型行为的未来方向。

Abstract: Consider this prompt "Draw a unicorn with two horns". Should large language
models (LLMs) recognize that a unicorn has only one horn by definition and ask
users for clarifications, or proceed to generate something anyway? We introduce
concept incongruence to capture such phenomena where concept boundaries clash
with each other, either in user prompts or in model representations, often
leading to under-specified or mis-specified behaviors. In this work, we take
the first step towards defining and analyzing model behavior under concept
incongruence. Focusing on temporal boundaries in the Role-Play setting, we
propose three behavioral metrics--abstention rate, conditional accuracy, and
answer rate--to quantify model behavior under incongruence due to the role's
death. We show that models fail to abstain after death and suffer from an
accuracy drop compared to the Non-Role-Play setting. Through probing
experiments, we identify two main causes: (i) unreliable encoding of the
"death" state across different years, leading to unsatisfactory abstention
behavior, and (ii) role playing causes shifts in the model's temporal
representations, resulting in accuracy drops. We leverage these insights to
improve consistency in the model's abstention and answer behaviors. Our
findings suggest that concept incongruence leads to unexpected model behaviors
and point to future directions on improving model behavior under concept
incongruence.

Motivation: 6G网络中知识理解是推动网络智能和AI原生架构的基础，而信息提取能将碎片化电信知识转化为结构化格式，帮助AI模型更好地理解网络术语。

Method: 提出TeleSEE技术，采用令牌高效表示方法预测实体类型和属性键，并结合分层并行解码策略优化编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 实验表明，TeleSEE在准确性上优于基线技术，且样本处理速度提高了5至9倍。

Conclusion: TeleSEE为电信领域的信息提取提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，有助于6G网络的知识理解。

Abstract: Knowledge understanding is a foundational part of envisioned 6G networks to
advance network intelligence and AI-native network architectures. In this
paradigm, information extraction plays a pivotal role in transforming
fragmented telecom knowledge into well-structured formats, empowering diverse
AI models to better understand network terminologies. This work proposes a
novel language model-based information extraction technique, aiming to extract
structured entities from the telecom context. The proposed telecom structured
entity extraction (TeleSEE) technique applies a token-efficient representation
method to predict entity types and attribute keys, aiming to save the number of
output tokens and improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, TeleSEE involves a
hierarchical parallel decoding method, improving the standard encoder-decoder
architecture by integrating additional prompting and decoding strategies into
entity extraction tasks. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of the
proposed technique in the telecom domain, we further designed a dataset named
6GTech, including 2390 sentences and 23747 words from more than 100 6G-related
technical publications. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed TeleSEE
method achieves higher accuracy than other baseline techniques, and also
presents 5 to 9 times higher sample processing speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可能生成伪装情感的阴谋论内容，现有检测方法依赖人类文本的情感特征，可能失效。

Method: 开发ConDID-v2数据集（包含LLM重写内容），并训练改进的检测模型ConspEmoLLM-v2。

Result: ConspEmoLLM-v2在原始和情感伪装内容上均表现优异，超越基线模型。

Conclusion: 改进的数据集和模型能有效检测伪装情感的阴谋论内容。

Abstract: Despite the many benefits of large language models (LLMs), they can also
cause harm, e.g., through automatic generation of misinformation, including
conspiracy theories. Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories
by altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their
typically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several
studies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are
usually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from
LLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including
the previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional
features of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised
content may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an
augmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which
supplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM
to reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the
rewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We
subsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of
ConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or
exceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content
in ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other
baselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2. The
project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM.

Motivation: 目前缺乏评估LLM在文本分类任务中可靠性的方法，研究旨在填补这一空白并提供系统化指导。

Method: 采用心理测量学原理，确定样本量、开发无效响应指标，并评估14种LLM在金融新闻情感分类中的表现，每种模型重复5次测试1,350篇文章。

Result: 模型在内部一致性上表现优异（90-98%完全一致），小模型如gemma3:1B表现优于大模型。但所有模型在预测市场走势时表现随机。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM选择、样本量规划和可靠性评估提供了系统化指导，帮助组织优化分类任务资源。

Abstract: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large
language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of
established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles,
we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses,
and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines
financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including
claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and
command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models
demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on
90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical
models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels,
models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models
like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger
counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market
movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our
framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning,
and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for
classification tasks.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在超长上下文中的有效性，尤其是在复杂结构和长距离语义依赖的场景（如小说）中。

Method: 通过TLDM基准测试，测试模型在情节摘要、故事世界配置和叙事时间流逝等方面的表现。

Result: 测试的七种前沿大型语言模型在超过64k标记后均无法保持稳定的理解能力。

Conclusion: 建议开发者需超越传统评估方法，关注复杂长上下文场景，并发布了TLDM基准以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to
millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack
approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of
subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over
128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we
release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's
ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative
time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable
understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers
must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model
performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we

TL;DR: MedBrowseComp是一个新基准，用于测试大型语言模型在临床实践中检索和综合多跳医学事实的能力，揭示了当前模型与临床需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要整合多种知识来源，现有评估方法未能充分测试模型的真实能力，因此需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MedBrowseComp基准，包含1000多个模拟临床场景的问题，测试模型从动态知识库中检索和综合信息的能力。

Result: 前沿模型在MedBrowseComp上的表现低至10%，显示其与临床实践要求的严谨性存在显著差距。

Conclusion: MedBrowseComp为未来模型和工具链的改进提供了明确目标，是可靠医学信息检索的重要测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support
tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating
heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents,
and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often
rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or
conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility
unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that
systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize
multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases.
MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror
clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting
information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to
frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent,
exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded
in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for
reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model
and toolchain upgrades. You can visit our project page at:

TL;DR: 论文提出DECASTE框架，用于检测和评估大语言模型中的种姓偏见，揭示模型系统性强化偏见的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽在NLP领域表现优异，但存在强化社会偏见的问题，尤其是针对印度边缘化种姓群体的偏见尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出DECASTE框架，从社会文化、经济、教育和政治四个维度评估种姓偏见，采用定制化提示策略。

Result: 研究发现多个先进大语言模型系统性强化种姓偏见，边缘化种姓群体（如Dalits和Shudras）受到显著不公平对待。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中潜藏的种姓偏见，强调需要更全面的偏见评估方法以减少现实应用中的风险。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across
diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been
shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based
on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the
reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized
caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by
proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and
assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates
caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,
and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By
benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models
systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in
the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias
scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant
caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.
These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and
emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation
methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in
real-world contexts.

TL;DR: CROSS是一个评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）文化安全推理能力的基准，涵盖多语言、多国家数据，揭示现有模型在文化安全方面的不足，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态安全基准忽视文化规范导致的符号伤害，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CROSS基准和CROSS-Eval框架，评估21个LVLMs，并开发监督微调和偏好调优两种改进策略。

Result: 模型在文化安全方面表现不佳，改进方法显著提升GPT-4o的文化意识和合规性。

Conclusion: 文化安全是LVLMs的重要挑战，改进方法有效但未完全解决问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally
distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to
produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing
multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook
violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To
address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the
cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284
multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday
domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when
images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural
theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness,
norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate
21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models.
Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model
achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some
open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably
short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning
capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To
improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised
fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning
with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors.
These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and
compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with
minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稠密检索模型计算成本高且适应性差，难以应对大规模检索任务和新领域的需求。

Method: CRAFT先使用稀疏检索模型筛选候选表格，再应用计算密集的稠密模型和神经重排序器，同时利用Gemini Flash 1.5生成表格描述和标题。

Result: CRAFT在检索性能上优于现有稀疏、稠密和混合检索方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过级联检索和增强表格表示，显著提升了表格问答的效率和效果。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a
large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval
models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for
large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new
datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In
this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that
first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables
before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural
re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further
enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using
Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models
(LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate
$\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.

Method: 使用文化特定数据集，设计LSKExtractor方法，评估和利用语言模型中的语言特定知识。

Result: 实验表明，模型在某些非英语语言（甚至低资源语言）中表现更好，平均准确率相对提升10%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更具文化包容性的语言模型提供了支持，强调了语言和文化背景对模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different
languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans
code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and
domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive
language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold
more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we
improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We
coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon.
As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ
culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social
behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using
chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even
better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that
semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we
hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in
corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific
"expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple
methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge
present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our
results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement
of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of
language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and
linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

Motivation: 解决在资源受限设备上部署大型语言模型进行信息提取时面临的幻觉、上下文长度限制和高延迟等问题。

Method: 采用双LoRA模块（模式识别LoRA和提取LoRA）结合增量模式缓存，优化模式识别和提取效率。

Result: 在多个信息提取数据集上的实验表明，DLISC在效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DLISC是一种高效且有效的信息提取方法，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) plays a crucial role in natural language
processing (NLP) by converting unstructured text into structured knowledge.
Deploying computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained devices for information extraction is challenging,
particularly due to issues like hallucinations, limited context length, and
high latency-especially when handling diverse extraction schemas. To address
these challenges, we propose a two-stage information extraction approach
adapted for on-device LLMs, called Dual-LoRA with Incremental Schema Caching
(DLISC), which enhances both schema identification and schema-aware extraction
in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, DLISC adopts an
Identification LoRA module for retrieving the most relevant schemas to a given
query, and an Extraction LoRA module for performing information extraction
based on the previously selected schemas. To accelerate extraction inference,
Incremental Schema Caching is incorporated to reduce redundant computation,
substantially improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple
information extraction datasets demonstrate notable improvements in both
effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 当前MAS依赖人工设计角色和协议，难以适应新任务；现有自动方法需验证集且缺乏动态适应性。

Method: SELF-MAS通过元级设计迭代生成、评估和优化MAS配置，支持动态智能体组合和问题分解。

Result: 在数学、QA和软件工程任务中，SELF-MAS平均准确率提升7.44%，且成本高效。

Conclusion: 元级自监督设计为创建高效、自适应MAS提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks.
However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and
communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the
underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent
automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically
necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking
adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first
self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design.
SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and
refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring
a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem
decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness.
Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering
benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying
sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS
baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next
strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore
the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and
adaptive MAS.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态LLMs（MLLMs）在语音输入数学推理任务中的能力，填补现有研究在逻辑逐步推理方面的空白。

Method: 提出Spoken-MQA基准，涵盖多种数学问题类型，包括算术、上下文推理和知识导向问题，通过实验评估语音模型的性能。

Result: 语音LLMs在上下文推理任务中表现尚可，但在直接算术和口头数学表达上表现较差，且数学知识推理能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前语音LLMs在数学推理任务中存在局限性，尤其在口头表达和直接算术方面，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However,
their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains
underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual
speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight
into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical
problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question
Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models
(ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of
math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual
reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in
unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find
that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning
tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic
problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical
expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized
mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities
are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型未直接训练于电子健康记录数据，但在临床自然语言处理任务中表现良好，研究旨在揭示其学习机制与实际需求的差距。

Method: 通过MedLingo数据集评估模型对临床术语的理解，并分析预训练语料库中临床术语和未经验证声明的频率及其来源。

Result: 临床术语在预训练语料中的出现频率与模型性能相关，但实际临床笔记中的高频术语在语料中罕见；模型可能重复未经验证的医学声明。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预训练数据与实际临床需求的不匹配，为未来数据集构建提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical
natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on
electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular
open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through
two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical
jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and
(2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we
investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their
corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data
composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate
clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo.
Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across
major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon
frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining
corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage.
Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed
claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed
the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical
claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

Abstract: Peer review is vital in academia for evaluating research quality. Top AI
conferences use reviewer confidence scores to ensure review reliability, but
existing studies lack fine-grained analysis of text-score consistency,

We employ deep learning to detect hedge sentences and aspects, then analyze
report length, hedge word/sentence frequency, aspect mentions, and sentiment to
evaluate text-score alignment. Correlation, significance, and regression tests
examine confidence scores' impact on paper outcomes. Results show high
text-score consistency across all levels, with regression revealing higher
confidence scores correlate with paper rejection, validating expert assessments

Conclusion: SDCV是一种有效的去噪方法，能够提升概念向量在复杂数据中的鲁棒性和引导效果。

Abstract: Linear Concept Vectors have proven effective for steering large language

difference-in-means derive these vectors from LLM hidden representations,
diverse data introduces noises (i.e., irrelevant features) that challenge
steering robustness. To address this, we propose Sparse Autoencoder-Denoised
Concept Vectors (SDCV), which uses Sparse Autoencoders to filter out noisy
features from hidden representations. When applied to linear probing and
difference-in-means, our method improves their steering success rates. We
validate our noise hypothesis through counterfactual experiments and feature

Method: 采用扩散语言模型构建文本嵌入模型，利用其双向注意力机制更好地编码全局上下文。

Result: 在长文档检索、推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索任务上分别比LLM嵌入模型提升20%、8%和2%，并在传统文本嵌入基准上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型因其双向注意力机制，在文本嵌入任务中表现出色，尤其在长文本和复杂文本的全局上下文编码中具有优势。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large
scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based
models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval.
However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional
attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the
bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting
diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent
bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs
especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the
diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding
model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval,
2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on
traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional
attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图表理解任务中需要大量高质量数据进行微调，导致数据收集和训练成本高。

Method: 提出ChartCards框架，系统合成图表信息（如数据表、可视化代码、视觉元素和多维语义标题），并构建MetaChart数据集。

Result: 在MetaChart上微调6种模型，平均性能提升5%，其中文本到图表检索和图表到表格任务提升显著（17%和28%）。

Conclusion: ChartCards和MetaChart为多任务图表理解提供了高效解决方案，显著降低了数据需求并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new
opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature
of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets
for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training
costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata
generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards
systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables,
visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions.
By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a
single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart
retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description,
and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart,
a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts,
and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through
qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments
across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on
MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all
tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and
chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements
of 17% and 28%, respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于基线，为自动化事实核查提供了新思路，并公开了代码以复现结果。

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in this digital age. To verify a
claim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying
on embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with
evidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later
have not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that
fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through
multiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence
pieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more
complex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on
entailment and the generative ability of language models to produce
''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a
claim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved
superior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different
prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the
literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw
evidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the
best performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training
language models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered
an improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same
dataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)
outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for
LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to
reproduce the results.

using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks

representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular
graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations:
the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition
and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even
worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results
highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary
molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will
catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for
chemical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架PSN-IRT，用于更准确评估大语言模型（LLMs）的能力，并揭示了当前基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估大语言模型时存在不一致性和区分度不足的问题，无法真实反映模型能力。

Method: 提出PSN-IRT框架，结合丰富的项目参数，基于项目反应理论（IRT）进行改进。

Result: 分析显示当前基准测试存在显著缺陷，PSN-IRT能构建更小但更符合人类偏好的基准。

Conclusion: PSN-IRT提供了一种更可靠的大语言模型评估方法，优化了基准测试的质量。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread,
yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among
top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic
model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark
effectiveness, examining main-stream prominent LLM benchmarks using results
from diverse models. We first propose a new framework for accurate and reliable
estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Specifically, we
propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced
Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters
within an IRT-grounded architecture. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive
analysis which reveals significant and varied shortcomings in the measurement
quality of current benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging
PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger
alignment with human preference.

*Jiashu He,Jinxuan Fan,Bowen Jiang,Ignacio Houine,Dan Roth,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-GIVE是一种基于检索-强化学习的框架，通过自动关联思维增强大型语言模型（LLM）在科学问题解答中的表现，解决了GIVE方法在效率、通用性和准确性上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GIVE方法在知识外推时的高计算成本、难以部署到小型LLM以及知识修剪不准确的问题。

Method: 提出Self-GIVE框架，结合检索和强化学习，自动提取结构化信息和实体集，帮助模型关联查询概念。

Result: 在生物医学QA任务中，Self-GIVE显著提升了3B和7B模型的性能（最高提升28.5%→71.4%和78.6%→90.5%），并减少90%以上的token使用。

Conclusion: Self-GIVE通过结构化检索和关联思维，实现了高效、可扩展的知识推理，使小型LLM性能媲美GPT3.5 turbo。

Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often
associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For
instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate
"hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and
insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models
(LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving
scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not
directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE)
addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured
knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many
hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose
Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic
associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts
structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the
queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls
and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on
smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate
knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE
with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B
models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and
$\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging
biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or
outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%.
Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and
reasoning with associative thinking.

TL;DR: 论文提出了UrduFactCheck，首个针对乌尔都语的模块化事实核查框架，填补了低资源语言事实核查的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在乌尔都语等低资源语言中的事实可靠性问题亟待解决，现有解决方案主要针对英语。

Method: 开发了动态多策略证据检索管道，结合单语和翻译方法，并发布两个新标注基准UrduFactBench和UrduFactQA。

Result: UrduFactCheck在多项指标上优于基线模型，翻译增强版本表现更优，同时评估了12种SOTA LLM在乌尔都语中的表现。

Conclusion: UrduFactCheck为乌尔都语事实核查提供了有效工具，开源代码和数据集推动相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns
regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource
languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions
overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million
Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first
comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu.
Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that
combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity
of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated
benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating
LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck,
particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms
baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further
benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in
Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models.

TL;DR: 小型语言模型（0.5B-5B参数）能否有效参与针对PTSD患者的创伤知情、共情对话？研究通过TIDE数据集和实验表明，微调可提升共情表现，但效果因场景和用户而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型语言模型在创伤知情对话中的潜力，为开发高效、安全的共情AI提供基础。

Method: 引入TIDE数据集（10,000条对话），基于三因素共情模型评估8个小型模型，并与前沿模型对比。

Result: 微调提升共情感知，但小型模型存在共情天花板；用户背景影响偏好。

Conclusion: 需结合上下文和用户需求设计系统，TIDE数据集为开发补充临床护理的AI奠定基础。

Abstract: Can small language models with 0.5B to 5B parameters meaningfully engage in
trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue for individuals with PTSD? We address this
question by introducing TIDE, a dataset of 10,000 two-turn dialogues spanning
500 diverse PTSD client personas and grounded in a three-factor empathy model:
emotion recognition, distress normalization, and supportive reflection. All
scenarios and reference responses were reviewed for realism and trauma
sensitivity by a clinical psychologist specializing in PTSD. We evaluate eight
small language models before and after fine-tuning, comparing their outputs to
a frontier model (Claude Sonnet 3.5). Our IRB-approved human evaluation and
automatic metrics show that fine-tuning generally improves perceived empathy,
but gains are highly scenario- and user-dependent, with smaller models facing
an empathy ceiling. Demographic analysis shows older adults value distress
validation and graduate-educated users prefer nuanced replies, while gender
effects are minimal. We highlight the limitations of automatic metrics and the
need for context- and user-aware system design. Our findings, along with the
planned release of TIDE, provide a foundation for building safe,
resource-efficient, and ethically sound empathetic AI to supplement, not
replace, clinical mental health care.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在低资源语言中，如何通过基于多臂老虎机的算法选择最优神经机器翻译模型，以解决领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的神经机器翻译系统在领域适应任务中面临数据不足和模型泛化能力差的问题，因此需要一种高效的方法选择最优模型。

Method: 采用基于多臂老虎机的算法（如Upper Confidence Bound、Linear UCB等）进行模型选择，以在资源受限的情况下实现高置信度的最优选择。

Result: 在三种非洲语言和多个领域的实验中验证了方法的鲁棒性和有效性，无论目标数据是否可用。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言的领域适应提供了一种高效的模型选择策略。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems face significant challenges when
working with low-resource languages, particularly in domain adaptation tasks.
These difficulties arise due to limited training data and suboptimal model
generalization, As a result, selecting an optimal model for translation is
crucial for achieving strong performance on in-domain data, particularly in
scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible or practical. In this paper, we
investigate strategies for selecting the most suitable NMT model for a given
domain using bandit-based algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound, Linear
UCB, Neural Linear Bandit, and Thompson Sampling. Our method effectively
addresses the resource constraints by facilitating optimal model selection with
high confidence. We evaluate the approach across three African languages and
domains, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in both scenarios where
target data is available and where it is absent.

Motivation: 中文社交媒体中的大量UGC为研究网络流行语提供了可能，探索LLMs是否能基于UGC生成准确的定义。

Method: 提出了RESS方法，通过引导LLMs的理解过程生成更准确的定义，并创建了CHEER数据集进行基准测试。

Result: RESS方法在生成定义上表现有效，但揭示了LLMs的共性问题，如过度依赖先验知识、推理能力不足等。

Conclusion: 本文为基于LLM的定义生成研究奠定了基础，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: The massive user-generated content (UGC) available in Chinese social media is
giving rise to the possibility of studying internet buzzwords. In this paper,
we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for
these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold
contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet
buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we
propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending
process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the
skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the
strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods
and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while
revealing crucial shared challenges: over-reliance on prior exposure,
underdeveloped inferential abilities, and difficulty identifying high-quality
UGC to facilitate comprehension. We believe our work lays the groundwork for
future advancements in LLM-based definition generation. Our dataset and code
are available at https://github.com/SCUNLP/Buzzword.

TL;DR: DISCO是一种改进GRPO的方法，通过领域感知和难度感知奖励缩放，解决多域不平衡数据中的泛化和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在多域不平衡数据中表现不佳，倾向于优化主导域，忽视弱势域，导致泛化和公平性问题。

Method: DISCO提出领域感知奖励缩放和难度感知奖励缩放，分别通过重加权和优先学习不确定提示来优化策略。

Result: DISCO在多个LLM和倾斜训练分布上表现优异，比现有GRPO变体提升5%，在多域对齐基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: DISCO通过创新的奖励缩放策略，显著提升了多域不平衡数据中的泛化能力和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences
through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its
simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned
value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution
and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in
real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO
disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented
ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose
Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled
extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key
innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by
reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward
scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize
uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies
promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that
DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on
Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在现实应用中表现突出，但在跨语言和文化知识整合方面的一致性仍是一个挑战。

Method: 引入KnowRecall（15种语言的视觉问答基准）和VisRecall（9种语言的视觉记忆基准）来评估MLLMs的跨语言一致性。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进模型也难以实现跨语言一致性。

Conclusion: 需要更鲁棒的方法来开发真正多语言且具备文化意识的模型。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

TL;DR: HopWeaver是一个自动生成多跳问题（MHQA）的框架，无需人工干预，能够从非结构化文本中合成高质量的问题，成本低于人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注多跳问题成本高，现有合成方法生成的问题过于简单或需要大量人工指导，因此需要一种自动化的高质量合成方法。

Method: HopWeaver通过识别跨文档的互补信息，合成两种多跳问题（桥接和比较），并构建真实的推理路径。

Result: 合成的问题质量与人工标注数据集相当或更高，且成本更低。

Conclusion: HopWeaver为资源稀缺的专业领域提供了一种高效的多跳问题数据集开发方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) is crucial for evaluating the model's
capability to integrate information from diverse sources. However, creating
extensive and high-quality MHQA datasets is challenging: (i) manual annotation
is expensive, and (ii) current synthesis methods often produce simplistic
questions or require extensive manual guidance. This paper introduces
HopWeaver, the first automatic framework synthesizing authentic multi-hop
questions from unstructured text corpora without human intervention. HopWeaver
synthesizes two types of multi-hop questions (bridge and comparison) using an
innovative approach that identifies complementary documents across corpora. Its
coherent pipeline constructs authentic reasoning paths that integrate
information across multiple documents, ensuring synthesized questions
necessitate authentic multi-hop reasoning. We further present a comprehensive
system for evaluating synthesized multi-hop questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the synthesized questions achieve comparable or superior
quality to human-annotated datasets at a lower cost. Our approach is valuable
for developing MHQA datasets in specialized domains with scarce annotated
resources. The code for HopWeaver is publicly available.

Motivation: 解决跨语言迁移中高资源语言到低资源语言的有效知识转移问题，提升稀疏微调方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DeFT-X方法，利用奇异值分解对预训练模型权重矩阵去噪，再进行基于幅度的剪枝，生成更鲁棒的稀疏微调向量。

Result: 在极低资源语言的情感分类和自然语言推理任务中，DeFT-X表现优于或与现有稀疏微调方法及其他基线方法相当。

Conclusion: DeFT-X通过去噪和稀疏微调结合，显著提升了跨语言迁移的效果，适用于低资源语言任务。

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the
benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages.
Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task
knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and
language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One
notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual
transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select
a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned.
These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the
pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a
target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These
sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning.
In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises
the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using
singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate
DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment
classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and
demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent
cross-lingual transfer baselines.

Result: 对先进LLMs进行评估，揭示了其在科学上下文理解中的优势和局限。

Conclusion: SciCUEval为未来科学领域LLMs的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual
understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across
diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks
primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity
of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding
capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning
biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating
diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and
unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies:
Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection,
Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a
variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of
state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their
strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering
valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺因其表面与隐含情感的不一致而对情感分析构成挑战，尤其是在特定国家或地区的语境中。研究旨在利用PMP技术解决这一问题。

Method: 使用PMP技术对澳大利亚和印度英语数据集BESSTIE进行讽刺检测，并与标准英语数据集FLUTE进行比较。测试了两种开源LLM（GEMMA和LLAMA）的性能。

Result: PMP方法在所有任务和数据集上均显著优于其他四种提示策略。此外，代理提示等技术通过外部知识检索缓解了上下文相关的问题。

Conclusion: PMP方法在生成多种英语变体的讽刺解释方面具有显著优势，为讽刺检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity
between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the
implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region.
Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that
has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for
explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a
benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to
an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called
BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them
with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our
approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA)
achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and
datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find
that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related
failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of
our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of
English.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SSMs在语言建模中的性能差异，尤其是其在关联召回任务中的表现，以揭示不同模型的内部工作机制。

Method: 在AR任务上测试多种模型（Transformers、Based SSM、Mamba、H3、Hyena），并通过因果干预分析其机制。此外，引入新的合成任务ATR以验证发现。

Result: Transformers和Based SSM在AR任务中表现最佳，Mamba次之，其他SSMs失败。因果干预显示，Transformers和Based通过归纳头存储关联，而SSMs仅在最后状态计算关联。ATR任务进一步验证了这些发现。

Conclusion: 不同架构在相同任务中可能有显著机制差异，强调了机制评估的重要性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and
performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable
performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance
on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency,
behavioural metrics provide little information as to why--on a mechanistic
level--certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we
conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models
fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3,
Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that
Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using
induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the
last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution
component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative
Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR
introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find
that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the
same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures
with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the
adoption of mechanistic evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于强化学习的LLM在多跳QA中因稀疏全局奖励而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 引入StepSearch框架，采用逐步近端策略优化方法，结合中间搜索奖励和基于信息增益的令牌级监督。

Result: 在标准多跳QA基准上显著优于基线，3B和7B模型分别提升11.2%和4.2%。

Conclusion: 细粒度逐步监督能有效优化深度搜索LLM，仅需少量训练数据即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based
agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based
document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but
underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from
global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce
StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal
policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed
intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on
information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We
constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing
sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a
set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it
significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2%
absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL
baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our
implementation is publicly available at

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual
Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for
expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been
linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide,
facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of
capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation
techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition
and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent
decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for
the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed
through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk
literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and
alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing
assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured
approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a
high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss
potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive
model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe
deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking
of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a
foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in
the domain of AI-driven mental health support.

TL;DR: 论文提出Row-of-Thought（RoT）方法，通过逐行遍历表格进行推理，减少幻觉问题，无需训练，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Long Chain-of-Thought（Long CoT）方法训练成本高且存在表格内容幻觉问题，需改进。

Method: RoT通过逐行遍历表格，结合LLM的反思能力，实现推理扩展和优化。

Result: RoT在非推理模型上平均优于RLLMs 4.3%，在WikiTableQuestions和TableBench上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: RoT高效且性能优越，显著减少幻觉问题，适用于表格推理任务。

Abstract: The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to
answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language
models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance
reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning.
However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low
reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose
Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal,
allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each
traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging
reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal
encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations.
Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an
average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions
and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT
outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在训练搜索代理方面表现出潜力，但其最优设计尚未完全理解，特别是奖励设计、LLM选择和搜索引擎的作用。

Method: 通过全面的实证研究，系统分析了奖励设计、LLM特性和搜索引擎在强化学习过程中的影响。

Result: 研究发现格式化奖励有效提升性能，LLM的规模和初始化对结果影响显著，搜索引擎的选择对训练动态和代理鲁棒性至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为实际应用中构建和部署基于LLM的搜索代理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training
large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world
problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated
LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use.
While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design
of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such
as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying
LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further
investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to
systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight
several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final
performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the
scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized)
significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a
critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained
agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully
building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code

Motivation: 研究发现过度依赖链式思维（CoT）推理会降低模型性能并导致输出冗长，影响效率。

Method: CAR框架首先生成简短答案并评估其困惑度，仅在模型置信度低时触发长推理。

Result: 实验表明，CAR在多种多模态VQA/KIE基准和文本推理数据集上优于简短答案和长推理方法。

Conclusion: CAR在准确性和效率之间实现了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened
outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does
not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks.
To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel
framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form
reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and
evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low
confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal
VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both
short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance
between accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReAct在复杂环境中推理步骤不连贯或脱离实际的问题，因其无法保持一致的内部信念和目标对齐。

Method: 引入ReflAct框架，强调对代理状态与目标的持续反思，并明确将决策基于状态。

Result: ReflAct在ALFWorld中平均成功率比ReAct提高27.7%，达到93.3%，且优于增强版的ReAct。

Conclusion: 强化核心推理框架是提升代理性能的关键，ReflAct通过持续反思和状态对齐实现了更高的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like
ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However,
ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to
misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that
this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and
goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely
planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative
to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing
goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This
design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7%
on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even
outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM),
showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent
performance.

Method: 论文将EcomScript定义为三个子任务，提出一个框架，通过语义相似性将产品关联到脚本步骤，并构建了大规模数据集EcomScriptBench。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs在EcomScript任务上表现不佳，但引入产品购买意图后性能有所提升。

Conclusion: 论文为电子商务脚本规划提供了首个大规模数据集和评估基准，并展示了改进LLMs性能的方法。

Abstract: Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of
actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for
typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based
assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby
facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this
capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the
inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product
retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies
between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark
data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the
task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks.
We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of
product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the
semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By
applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very
first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229
scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted
to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark.
Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges
with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase
intentions improves their performance.

Motivation: 解决现有机器遗忘评估方法假设遗忘集和保留集完全分离的问题，提出更现实的评估场景。

Method: 引入DUSK基准，构建描述相同事实但风格不同的文档集，定义七种评估指标。

Result: 评估九种现有方法，发现它们能移除表层文本但难以选择性删除深层知识。

Conclusion: DUSK为开发更精确的机器遗忘技术提供了公共基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or
sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while
preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing
evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint,
overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For
instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,
such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.
Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article
while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a
benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.
DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in
different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and
other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for
unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving
shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning
methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent
unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove
surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge
without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to
support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用知识图谱的结构信息和约束条件，导致大语言模型在推理和生成中存在不足。

Method: DP采用渐进式知识蒸馏策略，结合监督微调和Kahneman-Tversky优化，并引入推理-反思策略进行验证。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DP实现了最优性能，特别是在ComplexWebQuestions数据集上Hit@1提升了13%。

Conclusion: DP框架显著提升了模型的忠实性和可靠性，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or
outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the
prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their
structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can
enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the
reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a
trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which
sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a
progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors
into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky
optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation.
Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which
guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted
constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new
state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the
ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We
also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The
code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/Deliberation-on-Priors.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在推理链中嵌入私有或版权信息，使得信息遗忘比传统LLMs更复杂，需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 引入R-TOFU基准，结合梯度法和偏好优化基线，提出Reasoned IDK方法以平衡遗忘效果和模型效用。

Result: 传统方法在推理步骤中残留知识，而Reasoned IDK能更好地保留推理能力。解码变体仍可能泄露遗忘内容。

Conclusion: R-TOFU为LRMs的信息遗忘研究提供了系统基础，强调需在多样化解码设置下评估模型。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) embed private or copyrighted information not
only in their final answers but also throughout multi-step chain-of-thought
(CoT) traces, making reliable unlearning far more demanding than in standard
LLMs. We introduce Reasoning-TOFU (R-TOFU), the first benchmark tailored to
this setting. R-TOFU augments existing unlearning tasks with realistic CoT
annotations and provides step-wise metrics that expose residual knowledge
invisible to answer-level checks. Using R-TOFU, we carry out a comprehensive
comparison of gradient-based and preference-optimization baselines and show
that conventional answer-only objectives leave substantial forget traces in
reasoning. We further propose Reasoned IDK, a preference-optimization variant
that preserves coherent yet inconclusive reasoning, achieving a stronger
balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility than earlier refusal
styles. Finally, we identify a failure mode: decoding variants such as
ZeroThink and LessThink can still reveal forgotten content despite seemingly
successful unlearning, emphasizing the need to evaluate models under diverse
decoding settings. Together, the benchmark, analysis, and new baseline
establish a systematic foundation for studying and improving unlearning in LRMs
while preserving their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成内容缺乏文化多样性的问题。

Result: 多语言提示在多种模型上优于现有多样性增强技术，且能减少文化特定信息的幻觉。

Conclusion: 多语言提示有效提升LLM生成内容的多样性和文化准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and
overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering
factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting:
a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with
added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses,
and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have
language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity
by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training
data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA
70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently
outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature
sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show
that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level
and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues
reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show great potential in temporal
reasoning, most existing work focuses heavily on enhancing performance, often
neglecting the explainable reasoning processes underlying the results. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range
of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs'
capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings
reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying
solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel
structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text
for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal
knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural
information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix
adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally,
LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token
with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER
achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its
effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities. Our dataset and
code are available at https://github.com/carryTatum/GETER.

Conclusion: 当前LVLM评估系统存在漏洞，亟需更鲁棒的评估方法。

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred
tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual
modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key
research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool
LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image
induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these
biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel,
fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is
deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing
the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges
exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for
manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases
amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible.
Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation
strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems
and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

Conclusion: MentalMAC方法有效提升心理操纵检测能力，并开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse
that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the
complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders
the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for
training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLM's
performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of
real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose
MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs'
ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach
includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on
evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher-model-generated
multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from
complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000
real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human
annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows
the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs
across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be
released upon paper acceptance. Warning: This paper contains content that may

Result: 消融干预显著提升多语言推理性能，且语言与推理表示可解耦。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法为提升跨语言泛化提供了可解释的策略。

Abstract: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource
languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that
human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we
hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable
components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To
evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific
representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning
11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation
consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses
further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively
decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning
capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential
for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as
supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation
achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead.
These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual
reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for
improving cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Existing AI-generated text detection methods heavily depend on large
annotated datasets and external threshold tuning, restricting interpretability,
adaptability, and zero-shot effectiveness. To address these limitations, we
propose AGENT-X, a zero-shot multi-agent framework informed by classical
rhetoric and systemic functional linguistics. Specifically, we organize
detection guidelines into semantic, stylistic, and structural dimensions, each
independently evaluated by specialized linguistic agents that provide explicit
reasoning and robust calibrated confidence via semantic steering. A meta agent
integrates these assessments through confidence-aware aggregation, enabling
threshold-free, interpretable classification. Additionally, an adaptive
Mixture-of-Agent router dynamically selects guidelines based on inferred
textual characteristics. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that
AGENT-X substantially surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and zero-shot
approaches in accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

Method: 提出Web-Shepherd模型，基于WebPRM Collection（40K步级偏好对和标注清单）和WebRewardBench评估基准。

Result: Web-Shepherd在WebRewardBench上比GPT-4o准确率高30分，在WebArena-lite测试中性能提升10.9分且成本降低10倍。

Conclusion: Web-Shepherd为网页导航任务提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，推动了该领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life
tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making
beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized
reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and
test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and
cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which
poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in
this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd
which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve
this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K
step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains
and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe
that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to
using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by
using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve
10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini
as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DebackX的模型，用于解决复杂场景下的图像内机器翻译问题，提升了翻译质量和视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像内机器翻译研究多基于简化场景（如白底黑字单行文本），与实际应用场景差距较大，缺乏实用性。

Method: 提出DebackX模型，通过分离背景与文本图像、直接翻译文本图像并融合背景生成目标图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在翻译质量和视觉效果上均有提升。

Conclusion: DebackX模型为复杂场景下的图像内机器翻译提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate texts within images
from one language to another. Previous research on IIMT was primarily conducted
on simplified scenarios such as images of one-line text with black font in
white backgrounds, which is far from reality and impractical for applications
in the real world. To make IIMT research practically valuable, it is essential
to consider a complex scenario where the text backgrounds are derived from
real-world images. To facilitate research of complex scenario IIMT, we design
an IIMT dataset that includes subtitle text with real-world background. However
previous IIMT models perform inadequately in complex scenarios. To address the
issue, we propose the DebackX model, which separates the background and
text-image from the source image, performs translation on text-image directly,
and fuses the translated text-image with the background, to generate the target
image. Experimental results show that our model achieves improvements in both
translation quality and visual effect.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）生成长文本时，幻觉（hallucinations）倾向集中在文本的后半部分，需关注注意力机制和解码动态以改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成任务中表现出色，但其生成的幻觉问题仍显著，尤其在长文本的后半部分，缺乏对此位置分布的研究。

Method: 以长文档摘要为案例，研究幻觉在生成长响应中的位置分布，分析注意力机制和解码动态的影响。

Result: 幻觉在生成长文本的后半部分集中出现，表明位置偏差问题。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究缓解幻觉位置偏差的方法，以提高长文本生成的忠实度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation
capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and
fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant
challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research
focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been
paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text,
particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations
occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization
as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware
long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon:
hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of
the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential
contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over
long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional
hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding
segments of long outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxiRewriteCN是首个专注于中文去毒化并保留情感极性的数据集，包含1,556个标注样本，覆盖多种场景。评估17种LLM后发现，商业和MoE模型表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂情境下仍难以平衡安全性与情感保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，去毒化同时保留原意是重要但具挑战性的任务。中文的毒性表达常隐含于表情符号、谐音或语境中，现有方法易过度礼貌化，扭曲情感。

Method: 构建ToxiRewriteCN数据集，包含有毒句子、情感对齐的非毒改写及标注毒性范围。评估17种LLM在去毒准确性、流畅性、内容保留和情感极性四个维度。

Result: 商业和MoE模型整体表现最佳，但在表情符号、谐音和对话等复杂情境中，所有模型均难以平衡安全性与情感保真度。

Conclusion: ToxiRewriteCN为中文可控、情感感知的去毒化研究提供了支持，未来需进一步优化模型在复杂情境下的表现。

Abstract: Detoxifying offensive language while preserving the speaker's original intent
is a challenging yet critical goal for improving the quality of online
interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in rewriting
toxic content, they often default to overly polite rewrites, distorting the
emotional tone and communicative intent. This problem is especially acute in
Chinese, where toxicity often arises implicitly through emojis, homophones, or
discourse context. We present ToxiRewriteCN, the first Chinese detoxification
dataset explicitly designed to preserve sentiment polarity. The dataset
comprises 1,556 carefully annotated triplets, each containing a toxic sentence,
a sentiment-aligned non-toxic rewrite, and labeled toxic spans. It covers five
real-world scenarios: standard expressions, emoji-induced and homophonic
toxicity, as well as single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. We evaluate 17 LLMs,
including commercial and open-source models with variant architectures, across
four dimensions: detoxification accuracy, fluency, content preservation, and
sentiment polarity. Results show that while commercial and MoE models perform
best overall, all models struggle to balance safety with emotional fidelity in
more subtle or context-heavy settings such as emoji, homophone, and
dialogue-based inputs. We release ToxiRewriteCN to support future research on
controllable, sentiment-aware detoxification for Chinese.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双视角关键词引导（DPKG）框架，用于多跳问题生成（MQG），通过区分问题关键词和文档关键词，更有效地定位关键信息片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用关键词的引导潜力，且未区分问题特定和文档特定关键词的不同作用。

Method: 定义了双视角关键词（问题和文档关键词），并设计了DPKG框架，包含扩展的Transformer编码器和两个答案感知的解码器。

Result: 实验证明DPKG框架在多跳问题生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DPKG框架显著提升了MQG任务的性能，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-hop question generation (MQG) aims to generate questions that require
synthesizing multiple information snippets from documents to derive target
answers. The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial
information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying
on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding
potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of
question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define
dual-perspective keywords (i.e., question and document keywords) and propose a
Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates
keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question
keywords capture the questioner's intent, whereas document keywords reflect the
content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords
work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with
question keywords required to appear in the generated question. The DPKG
framework consists of an expanded transformer encoder and two answer-aware
transformer decoders for keyword and question generation, respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, showcasing its
promising performance and underscoring its significant value in the MQG task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感支持对话任务的定义过于简化，忽略了支持者在单轮对话中可能使用多种策略的现象。

Method: 通过分析ESConv数据集，重新定义任务，并提出多种建模方法，包括监督深度学习模型和大型语言模型。

Result: 实验表明，大型语言模型在重新定义的任务中表现优于监督模型和人类支持者，且展现出更全面的支持能力。

Conclusion: 论文强调了情感支持对话中多策略使用的重要性，并展示了大型语言模型在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversations (ESC) are crucial for providing empathy,
validation, and actionable guidance to individuals in distress. However,
existing definitions of the ESC task oversimplify the structure of supportive
responses, typically modelling them as single strategy-utterance pairs. Through
a detailed corpus analysis of the ESConv dataset, we identify a common yet
previously overlooked phenomenon: emotional supporters often employ multiple
strategies consecutively within a single turn. We formally redefine the ESC
task to account for this, proposing a revised formulation that requires
generating the full sequence of strategy-utterance pairs given a dialogue
history. To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling
approaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language
models. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art
LLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary
to some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and
provide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities.

*Silvia Cappelletti,Tobia Poppi,Samuele Poppi,Zheng-Xin Yong,Diego Garcia-Olano,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'prefilling attack'的简单方法，通过在模型输出前添加结构化前缀（如'正确选项是：'），显著提升了多选问答任务中基于首词概率（FTP）评估的准确性、校准性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于首词概率（FTP）的多选问答评估方法存在脆弱性，如模型可能生成无关的高概率词（错位）或将有效词误用为通用前缀（误解），影响符号评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出'prefilling attack'方法，即在模型输出前添加结构化自然语言前缀，引导模型生成清晰有效的选项，无需修改模型参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了FTP在多选问答任务中的准确性、校准性和一致性，性能优于标准FTP，且与需要完整解码和外部分类器的开放生成方法相当，但效率更高。

Conclusion: prefilling是一种简单、鲁棒且低成本的方法，可显著提升FTP在多选问答评估中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice
question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which
selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While
efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated
tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic
preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*),
undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple
solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g.,
"*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored
in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a
clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP
with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and
output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It
outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended
generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers,
while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling
is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of
FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于单元语言的文本无关语音翻译方法，解决了跨模态和跨语言对齐的挑战，并通过任务提示建模优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音到语音翻译（S2ST）面临跨模态特征提取和跨语言长序列对齐的挑战，需要一种新的表示方法。

Method: 使用单元语言作为类文本表示，结合多任务学习和任务提示建模，优化语音翻译过程。

Result: 在Voxpupil数据集的四种语言上，方法显著优于基线模型，性能接近基于文本的模型。

Conclusion: 单元语言和任务提示建模有效解决了S2ST的核心挑战，为无文本翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models
has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1)
extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal
(CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences,
called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two
modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like
representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We
implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the
speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying
source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt
modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of
the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a
strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with
text.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的对比性改写攻击方法（CoPA），利用现成的大语言模型（LLM）欺骗文本检测器，解决了现有方法需要大量数据和计算资源的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）的滥用（如学术抄袭）催生了文本检测器的发展，而改写攻击试图绕过检测。现有方法需大量资源且对高级检测算法效果不佳，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: CoPA通过精心设计的指令让LLM生成更接近人类的文本，并构建辅助的机器化词分布作为对比，在解码过程中减去机器化模式，生成更不易被检测的文本。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，CoPA能有效欺骗多种场景下的文本检测器。

Conclusion: CoPA是一种高效且无需训练的改写攻击方法，显著提升了对抗文本检测器的能力。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has
driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass
these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these
texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require
substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,
and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection
algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive
\textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that
effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is
to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like
texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can
still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes
that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an
auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like
distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns
from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to
produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical
analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlowKV是一种新颖的多轮隔离机制，用于管理KV缓存，避免重复压缩早期对话内容，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的线性增长和多轮对话中的重复压缩导致信息丢失和性能下降，需要一种更高效的缓存管理方法。

Method: FlowKV通过多轮隔离机制，仅压缩最新生成的KV对，保留历史压缩缓存，避免重复压缩。

Result: FlowKV在指令遵循准确性和用户偏好保留方面显著优于基线方法，提升幅度从10.90%到75.40%。

Conclusion: FlowKV有效解决了多轮对话中的KV缓存管理问题，显著提升了性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache
presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with
dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction
strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early
conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting.
This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism}
for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression
method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation
mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns.
Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs
of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of
older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results
demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline
strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference
retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

follows a psychologically grounded taxonomy. Existing datasets either use
inconsistent emotion categories, suffer from limited sample size, or focus on

Motivation: 为了更好地理解KL散度在语言模型中的行为，尤其是在不同架构模型间的比较。

Method: 通过基于对数似然向量的坐标分配方法，系统评估KL散度，涵盖预训练检查点、微调与基础模型及层的比较。

Result: 发现预训练过程中模型轨迹呈螺旋结构，层间轨迹呈线状；对数似然空间中模型轨迹比权重空间中更受限。

Conclusion: 对数似然空间中的KL散度分析揭示了语言模型行为的独特结构，为模型比较提供了新视角。

Abstract: A recently proposed method enables efficient estimation of the KL divergence
between language models, including models with different architectures, by
assigning coordinates based on log-likelihood vectors. To better understand the
behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide
range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis
covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models,
and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as
measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and
thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of
diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more
constrained than those in weight space.

Conclusion: 研究强调了语音产生范式的重要性，为改进脑机接口提供了方向，但需进一步解决噪声和伪影问题。

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential
for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical
communication technologies. In this study, we investigated
magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during
speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks.
Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone
classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine
learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network
architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding
phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding
accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and
playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available
during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently
outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of
traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and
high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency
bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz)
and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy,
suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural
processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether
decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement
artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological
refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of
examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity,
offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals
with severe speech impairments.

Conclusion: 自然语言推理在自动化代码调试和解决复杂编程问题中具有潜力。

Abstract: Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging
efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when
addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of
algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance
code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What
type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what
specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging
process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that
employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code
debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that
NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader
modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our
findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance
automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代理研究主要集中在英语场景，而全球有7000多种语言需要类似的服务。现有研究无法满足多语言代理应用的需求。

Method: 提出X-WebAgentBench，一个交互式网络环境中的多语言代理基准测试工具，评估语言代理的规划和交互性能，并测试不同LLM和跨语言对齐方法的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型结合跨语言技术，也无法取得令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: X-WebAgentBench有望成为多语言代理场景的实用基准测试工具，推动全球代理智能的发展。

Abstract: Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant
success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and
industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research
predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000
languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services.
Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting
the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this
gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an
interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction
performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing
to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the
performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining
their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced
models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to
achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a
valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain
a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the
capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack
the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e.,
which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the
prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where
attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level
semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language
generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for
sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty
measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty
scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as
total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive
detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average
AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty
scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we
preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its
promising usage.

*DongGeon Lee,Joonwon Jang,Jihae Jeong,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在面对真实用户分享的表情包时，安全性显著降低，比合成或文字图像更易产生有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有VLMs在真实表情包场景下的安全性，揭示其潜在风险。

Method: 引入MemeSafetyBench基准，包含50,430个真实表情包与有害/无害指令配对，通过安全分类法和LLM生成指令评估多模型。

Result: 表情包显著增加有害输出并减少拒绝率，多轮交互仅部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 需更生态有效的评估方法和更强的安全机制。

Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet
most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are
current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To
investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance
benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions.
Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we
assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate
how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of
conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to
meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes
significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to
text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation,
elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for
ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否受锚定效应影响及其机制和缓解策略。

Method: 引入新数据集SynAnchors，结合评估指标对主流LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: LLMs普遍存在锚定效应，浅层作用明显，常规策略无效，推理能力可部分缓解。

Conclusion: 呼吁LLM评估应关注认知偏差，而非标准基准或过度优化的鲁棒性测试。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has advanced natural
language processing, yet concerns about cognitive biases are growing. In this
paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind
relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments.
We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms,
and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the
anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined
evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show
that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not
eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some
mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM
evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness
tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在数学和编程等任务上表现出色，但其推理能力提升未必带来安全性改进，甚至可能降低安全性，因此研究如何增强LRMs的安全性。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）进行实验，分析直接蒸馏安全响应的失败模式，并提出改进方法；同时探讨推理过程的复杂性对安全性的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LRMs安全性提供了全面视角，强调推理过程简化的重要性，并公开了代码与数据。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on
reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their
enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety
performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important
research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we
present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs
through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an
unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1
fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify
three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that
explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can
lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and
complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we
find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain
comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn
than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection
on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math
reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and
over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more
holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our
experiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法通常强制新旧LoRA分支对旧任务贡献均等，可能导致遗忘问题。

Method: 提出GainLoRA方法，为每个新任务扩展LoRA分支，并通过门控模块整合新旧分支，最小化新分支对旧任务的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，GainLoRA在持续学习基准测试中优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: GainLoRA通过门控模块有效缓解遗忘问题，提升了语言模型在持续学习中的整体性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks
sequentially, is crucial for language models (LMs). Recently, low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs.
However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA
branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to
contribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this
work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation
(GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task
and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches.
Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the
contribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating
forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results
on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少NSFW内容和社交偏见，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了扩散模型的社会责任，且可与现有方法结合使用。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images
has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen
regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and
exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world
applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on
employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or
alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive
concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal
model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content
in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to
identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text
embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting
individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt
towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model
robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the
impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method
can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social
responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias
generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 解决构建语言模型映射时因依赖大量文本计算对数似然而导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用重采样方法，根据每个文本在不同模型下对数似然的方差选择重要性文本，减少所需文本数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需约一半文本即可达到与均匀采样相当的KL散度估计性能，并能高效整合新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了语言模型映射的高效和可扩展构建。

Abstract: We address the computational cost of constructing a model map, which embeds
diverse language models into a common space for comparison via KL divergence.
The map relies on log-likelihoods over a large text set, making the cost
proportional to the number of texts. To reduce this cost, we propose a
resampling method that selects important texts with weights proportional to the
variance of log-likelihoods across models for each text. Our method
significantly reduces the number of required texts while preserving the
accuracy of KL divergence estimates. Experiments show that it achieves
comparable performance to uniform sampling with about half as many texts, and
also facilitates efficient incorporation of new models into an existing map.
These results enable scalable and efficient construction of language model
maps.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS,
a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It
synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with
Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an
adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching
between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for
complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B
activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,
FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear
complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE
structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context
length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our
comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,
Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage
Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general

on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like
Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏（KD）可将大语言模型压缩为小模型并保持性能，但对小模型的效果及知识转移机制研究不足。本文通过大规模实验发现，KD对小模型（0.5B-7B参数）在零样本任务中平均提升10%，但对大模型效果有限（1.3%）。教师模型性能影响小，任务专长更关键。KD虽提升准确性，但可能损害推理忠实度。

Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏对小语言模型的效果及知识转移机制，填补研究空白。

Method: 对0.5B至7B参数的模型在14个复杂推理任务上进行零样本设置的大规模实证与统计分析。

Result: KD对小模型平均提升10%，峰值任务提升22%；大模型仅提升1.3%。教师任务专长比性能更重要，且KD可能损害推理忠实度。

Conclusion: KD对小模型效果显著，但对大模型有限；需权衡准确性提升与推理忠实度损失。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large language
models into smaller ones while preserving performance. Despite the recent
traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs)
and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this
work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD
across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks
in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average
performance of smaller models by up to $10\%$, with a peak task specific gain
of $22\%$, while providing only marginal benefits ($\sim 1.3\%$) for larger
models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student
outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation
study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show
diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements
in student performance and reasoning fidelity, suggesting that while KD
enhances accuracy, it does not always maintain the structured decision-making
processes of the teacher. Our ablation study further highlights the importance
of teacher signals and logit smoothing in influencing students' performance
after distillation. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive empirical and
statistical assessment of KD, highlighting both its benefits and trade-offs
when distilling knowledge from larger to smaller LMs.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation remains a critical challenge in adapting pre-trained

fine-tuning approaches such as adapters. We introduce AdUE1, an efficient
post-hoc uncertainty estimation (UE) method, to enhance softmax-based
estimates. Our approach (1) uses a differentiable approximation of the maximum

fine-tuned head weights and regularizing the model. Evaluations on five NLP
classification datasets across four language models (RoBERTa, ELECTRA, LLaMA-2,
Qwen) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms established
baselines such as Mahalanobis distance and softmax response. Our approach is
lightweight (no base-model changes) and produces better-calibrated confidence.

Method: 提出RoleRAG框架，包含六个模块，使用角色特定令牌优化，并通过查询图动态分解查询。所有模块由同一LLM驱动。

Result: 在五个开放域问答数据集上的实验证明了框架的有效性、通用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: RoleRAG通过统一框架和动态模块激活，优化了RAG的多任务处理，减少了资源消耗。

Abstract: Existing studies have optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across
various sub-tasks, such as query understanding and retrieval refinement, but
integrating these optimizations into a unified framework remains challenging.
To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework
that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token
optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task
within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent
the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to
the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM,
distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized.
This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a
single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource
consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of
our framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出RLPA框架，通过强化学习动态优化用户画像，提升个性化对话效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态方法在冷启动和长期个性化方面表现不足，需动态优化用户画像。

Method: RLPA框架结合强化学习，通过双层次奖励机制（画像奖励和响应奖励）优化对话模型。

Result: Qwen-RLPA在个性化对话中表现优于现有方法，甚至超越商业模型如Claude-3.5和GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 动态画像推断是构建个性化对话系统的更有效范式。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and
offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in
cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently
static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement
Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts
with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles
through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward
structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user
representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses
consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines,
and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o.
Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting
user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more

TL;DR: 论文提出Joint Flashback Adaptation方法，通过引入少量旧任务提示（flashbacks）并约束模型输出偏差，结合潜在任务插值，解决大语言模型增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在增量学习新任务时易受灾难性遗忘影响，现有方法在现实场景中受限。

Method: 提出Joint Flashback Adaptation，结合flashbacks和潜在任务插值，联合学习新旧任务。

Result: 在1000+任务实验中，方法显著提升新任务泛化能力并减少旧任务遗忘。

Conclusion: Joint Flashback Adaptation是一种高效、任务无关的增量学习方法。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks.
However, it is challenging for them to learn new tasks incrementally due to
catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches rely on experience replay,
optimization constraints, or task differentiation, which encounter strict
limitations in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Joint
Flashback Adaptation. We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of
prompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the
deviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then
interpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly
learning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data
sparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth
adaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without
access to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive
experiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+
instruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning
tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
improving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LoRA在参数高效微调中表现优异，但在多任务场景中任务间干扰限制了其应用。现有方法（如MOE和非对称LoRA）仍面临样本稀缺和噪声干扰问题。

Method: 提出CoLA架构，采用高效初始化方案和三种协作策略，优化矩阵A和B的定量关系。

Result: 实验表明CoLA在低样本场景下表现优于现有PEFT方法，具有更高的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoLA通过灵活的架构和协作策略，显著提升了LoRA在多任务和低样本环境中的性能，为PEFT提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals a power-law
relationship, showing diminishing return on performance as model scale
increases. While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning
a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full
fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally
expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like
LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the
pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in
particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios
is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as
Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these
issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to
their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA
architecture with an efficient initialization scheme, and introduces three
collaborative strategies to enhance performance by better utilizing the
quantitative relationships between matrices $A$ and $B$. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoLA, outperforming existing
PEFT methods, especially in low-sample scenarios. Our data and code are fully
publicly available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/CoLA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in diverse reasoning tasks, yet their application to complex
physics reasoning remains underexplored. Physics reasoning presents unique
challenges, requiring grounding in physical conditions and the interpretation
of multimodal information. Current physics benchmarks are limited, often
focusing on text-only inputs or solely on problem-solving, thereby overlooking
the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process
formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first
multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs
across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process
formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a
comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics
reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在训练中接触社会偏见数据，导致其表现出性别偏见，需要量化评估并减轻这种偏见。

Method: 提出GenBiasEval和GenHintEval数据集及评分标准，并设计LFTF算法，通过BMI评分定位偏见相关模块并微调。

Result: 实验表明LFTF算法能显著减轻LLMs的性别偏见，同时保持其通用能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和算法为评估和减轻LLMs中的性别偏见提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention
due to their powerful performance. However, due to the unavoidable exposure to
socially biased data during training, LLMs tend to exhibit social biases,
particularly gender bias. To better explore and quantifying the degree of
gender bias in LLMs, we propose a pair of datasets named GenBiasEval and
GenHintEval, respectively. The GenBiasEval is responsible for evaluating the
degree of gender bias in LLMs, accompanied by an evaluation metric named
AFGB-Score (Absolutely Fair Gender Bias Score). Meanwhile, the GenHintEval is
used to assess whether LLMs can provide responses consistent with prompts that
contain gender hints, along with the accompanying evaluation metric UB-Score
(UnBias Score). Besides, in order to mitigate gender bias in LLMs more
effectively, we present the LFTF (Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning)
algorithm.The algorithm first ranks specific LLM blocks by their relevance to
gender bias in descending order using a metric called BMI (Block Mitigating
Importance Score). Based on this ranking, the block most strongly associated
with gender bias is then fine-tuned using a carefully designed loss function.
Numerous experiments have shown that our proposed LFTF algorithm can
significantly mitigate gender bias in LLMs while maintaining their general
capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KaFT的知识感知微调方法，通过根据知识冲突水平调整训练权重，显著提升了大型语言模型在领域特定问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调（SFT）方法在领域特定问答任务中表现不佳，主要因为模型内部知识与训练数据上下文知识之间的冲突。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了查询多样化策略以检测知识冲突，并提出KaFT方法，通过为不同冲突水平的训练样本分配不同奖励来调整训练权重。

Result: 实验表明，KaFT在四种大型语言模型上均带来显著改进，同时提升了模型泛化能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: KaFT是一种简单而有效的方法，能够通过知识冲突感知显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the
domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models
(LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between
LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla
SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we
first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and
then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge
conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute
differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic
performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data,
appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by
this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely
KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to
adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training
samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT
brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses
prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates
the hallucination.

Motivation: 探索LLMs如何将预训练中记忆的token序列转化为可重用的知识，并通过泛化利用这些知识。

Method: 提出protoknowledge的分类（词汇、层次、拓扑），并通过KATs测量其特性。采用新分析框架评估模型预测是否与相关protoknowledge的激活一致。

Result: 研究发现protoknowledge的语义偏见等特性，并验证其对文本到SPARQL任务的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为探索语义级数据污染提供了实用工具，并为封闭预训练模型提供了有效策略。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how
sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during
pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token
sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage
this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then
categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms,
varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure
protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general
properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of
protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies
depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework
that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of
the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a
practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an
effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.

Result: 测试时缩放的增益因语言差异显著，低资源语言推理一致性较低。MITT显著提升了低资源语言的推理性能。

Conclusion: MITT是一种有效的轻量级方法，可提升多语言环境下的推理性能，尤其适用于低资源语言。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a widely adopted inference-time strategy for
boosting reasoning performance. However, its effectiveness has been studied
almost exclusively in English, leaving its behavior in other languages largely
unexplored. We present the first systematic study of test-time scaling in
multilingual settings, evaluating DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across both high- and low-resource Latin-script
languages. Our findings reveal that the relative gains from test-time scaling
vary significantly across languages. Additionally, models frequently switch to
English mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts.
We further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning
thoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal
consistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our
findings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an
unsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers
high-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all
languages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance.
MITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance,
especially for underrepresented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中的偏差问题影响其可靠性和公平性，现有方法依赖标注数据且覆盖有限，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合概念激活向量（CAVs）和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）提取可解释概念表示，通过表示相似性量化偏差。

Result: BiasLens与传统偏差评估指标高度一致（Spearman相关系数r > 0.85），并能发现传统方法难以检测的偏差形式。

Conclusion: BiasLens为LLM的公平性和透明度提升提供了可扩展、可解释的高效范式。

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their
reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference
concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,
"positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target
concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For
instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular
sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of
LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring
model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort
and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based
on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract
interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the
variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of
the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong
agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >
0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect
using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a
patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic
assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient
paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and
transparency in LLMs.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）能力时，QA和RC基准的偏见问题可能影响公平性。

Method: 对30篇基准论文进行定性内容分析，对20个基准数据集进行定量分析。

Result: 大多数基准论文未提供创建者信息，仅一篇明确提及解决社会代表性问题的措施。数据中存在性别、宗教和地域偏见。

Conclusion: 需要更透明和关注偏见的基准创建实践，以促进更公平的LLM发展。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) and reading comprehension (RC) benchmarks are
essential for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
retrieving and reproducing knowledge. However, we demonstrate that popular QA
and RC benchmarks are biased and do not cover questions about different
demographics or regions in a representative way, potentially due to a lack of
diversity of those involved in their creation. We perform a qualitative content
analysis of 30 benchmark papers and a quantitative analysis of 20 respective
benchmark datasets to learn (1) who is involved in the benchmark creation, (2)
how social bias is addressed or prevented, and (3) whether the demographics of
the creators and annotators correspond to particular biases in the content.
Most analyzed benchmark papers provided insufficient information regarding the
stakeholders involved in benchmark creation, particularly the annotators.
Notably, just one of the benchmark papers explicitly reported measures taken to
address social representation issues. Moreover, the data analysis revealed
gender, religion, and geographic biases across a wide range of encyclopedic,
commonsense, and scholarly benchmarks. More transparent and bias-aware QA and
RC benchmark creation practices are needed to facilitate better scrutiny and
incentivize the development of fairer LLMs.

Abstract: Critical questions are essential resources to provoke critical thinking when
encountering an argumentative text. We present our system for the Critical
Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) Shared Task at ArgMining 2025. Our approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought prompting to
generate critical questions guided by Walton's argumentation schemes. For each
input intervention, we conversationally prompt LLMs to instantiate the
corresponding argument scheme template to first obtain structured arguments,
and then generate relevant critical questions. Following this, we rank all the
available critical questions by prompting LLMs to select the top 3 most helpful
questions based on the original intervention text. This combination of
structured argumentation theory and step-by-step reasoning enables the
generation of contextually relevant and diverse critical questions. Our
pipeline achieves competitive performance in the final test set, showing its
potential to foster critical thinking given argumentative text and detect
missing or uninformed claims. Code available at

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages
retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates
how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently
based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to
capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting
passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how
state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant
passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with
over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among
the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional
bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by
related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and
distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that
sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM
positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将LLMs转化为更有效的教学工具，同时保留了模型的推理能力，并通过思考标签增强了可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization
for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which
requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an
online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly
adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by
emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving
away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without
human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary
models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance
pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the
Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve
reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally
enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's
instructional planning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by
generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit
substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we
investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,
we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient
reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on
this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method
(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target
length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal
balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based
on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during
training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and
dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of
thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be
difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.
This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow
thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed
LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both
reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and
its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage
by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise
reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理中存在多步逻辑执行的挑战，但现有评估框架仅关注最终答案的准确性，无法全面反映其表现。

Method: 研究提出了一种名为MAPLE的评估指标，通过整合错误率、冗余性和有效性来量化推理偏差。

Result: MAPLE评分能够更全面地评估语言模型在数学推理中的表现，揭示传统准确性评估的局限性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架为评估语言模型的数学推理能力提供了更全面的视角，有助于改进模型的设计和训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable potential in various
natural language tasks but face significant challenges in mathematical
reasoning, particularly in executing precise, multi-step logic. However,
current evaluation frameworks judge their performance solely based on accuracy,
which only accounts for the final answer. This study explores these pitfalls by
employing a novel evaluation framework. We propose an evaluation metric called
the MAPLE score, which holistically quantifies reasoning misalignment by
integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity.

Method: 自动评估模型忠实性，并分析指令微调对ClimateGPT忠实性的影响，通过排除不忠实训练数据改进模型。

Result: 改进后的ClimateGPT Faithful+在支持的原子声明中忠实性从30%提升至57%。

Conclusion: 改进训练数据可显著提升检索增强生成模型的忠实性，为气候科学领域提供更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the
potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the
public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible.
While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on
retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether
the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we
explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this
setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in
climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact
the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's
training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement
in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our
automatic metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DeepSeek-R1依赖高质量长CoT数据和微调，成本高。本文旨在通过引导技术提升LLM推理能力，避免数据依赖。

Method: 使用SAE提取CoT特征引导LLM内部状态，或直接计算残差激活的引导方向（SAE-free）。

Result: 实验表明，SAE和SAE-free算法均显著提升LLM推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的引导技术为LLM推理增强提供了一种高效且无需外部数据的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and
mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT
length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this
reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT
data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of
DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of
an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are
then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing
that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce
a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering
directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an
explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and
subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的方法，用于在Canary模型中实现单词级时间戳预测，无需外部对齐机制，准确率在80%-90%之间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的时间戳信息对语音内容检索和定时字幕等下游任务至关重要，传统方法需要外部模块，而新方法避免了这一需求。

Method: 利用NeMo Forced Aligner作为教师模型生成时间戳，并训练Canary模型直接预测时间戳，同时引入新标记<|timestamp|>。

Result: 在四种语言中，时间戳预测误差为20-120毫秒，准确率和召回率为80%-90%，WER退化最小；在自动语音翻译任务中误差约为200毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在单词级时间戳预测上表现优异，且适用于多种语言和任务。

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach for enabling word-level timestamp
prediction in the Canary model. Accurate timestamp information is crucial for a
variety of downstream tasks such as speech content retrieval and timed
subtitles. While traditional hybrid systems and end-to-end (E2E) models may
employ external modules for timestamp prediction, our approach eliminates the
need for separate alignment mechanisms. By leveraging the NeMo Forced Aligner
(NFA) as a teacher model, we generate word-level timestamps and train the
Canary model to predict timestamps directly. We introduce a new <|timestamp|>
token, enabling the Canary model to predict start and end timestamps for each
word. Our method demonstrates precision and recall rates between 80% and 90%,
with timestamp prediction errors ranging from 20 to 120 ms across four
languages, with minimal WER degradation. Additionally, we extend our system to
automatic speech translation (AST) tasks, achieving timestamp prediction errors
around 200 milliseconds.

Motivation: 揭示开源LLM微调后私有数据被提取的新风险，强调其严重性。

Method: 通过后门训练，仅需黑盒访问微调模型，提取私有数据。实验覆盖4种开源模型和2个数据集。

Result: 提取率高达76.3%（实际场景）和94.9%（理想场景），防御策略易被绕过。

Conclusion: 开源LLM微调存在严重数据泄露风险，亟需更多研究应对。

Abstract: Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data
is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific
LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the
practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private
downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring
black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive
experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B
parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance
can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream
fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly
extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings.
We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed
with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly
identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up
research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型多局限于轮换式交互，缺乏实时适应性（如用户打断）。

Method: 采用预训练的流式编码器处理用户输入，无需语音预训练；独立建模代理和用户架构，优化代理语音并降低比特率。

Result: 模型在推理、轮换和打断能力上优于现有双工模型，且所需语音数据更少。

Conclusion: 该模型是首个公开可用的双工S2S模型，简化了从任意LLM构建双工S2S模型的过程。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet
current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based
exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a
novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user
inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models
simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for
user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech
pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec
fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared
to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in
abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech
pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex
S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S
model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遗忘方法在平衡遗忘效果和模型能力上的不足，避免模型崩溃或泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：(I)通过令牌优化将遗忘目标绑定到模型的自回归概率分布，(II)轻量级模型编辑激活令牌以概率性诱导遗忘目标。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，UniErase仅修改约3.66%的LLM参数，遗忘效果提升4.01倍，同时模型能力保持更好。

Conclusion: UniErase在遗忘领域实现了双重顶级性能，为令牌学习诱导遗忘目标提供了新研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as
knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or
illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for
targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of
sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based
unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability,
frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge
removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual
prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from
limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this
work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable
parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted
forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an
optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's
autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by
(II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to
probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new
research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and
precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings.
Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66%
of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around
4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly,
UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by
35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current
unlearing domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解具体性在心理和大脑中的表征是心理学、神经科学和计算语言学的核心问题，但语言模型如何表征具体性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过行为判断估计人类隐含的语义距离，并使用表征相似性分析比较人类和语言模型的语义表征。

Result: 人类和语言模型的表征空间在具体性维度上显著一致，且这种一致性主要由具体性驱动。

Conclusion: 人类和语言模型在具体性维度上趋同，但在其他维度上不一致，表明具体性是两者表征的共同基础。

Abstract: The nouns of our language refer to either concrete entities (like a table) or
abstract concepts (like justice or love), and cognitive psychology has
established that concreteness influences how words are processed. Accordingly,
understanding how concreteness is represented in our mind and brain is a
central question in psychology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics.
While the advent of powerful language models has allowed for quantitative
inquiries into the nature of semantic representations, it remains largely
underexplored how they represent concreteness. Here, we used behavioral
judgments to estimate semantic distances implicitly used by humans, for a set
of carefully selected abstract and concrete nouns. Using Representational
Similarity Analysis, we find that the implicit representational space of
participants and the semantic representations of language models are
significantly aligned. We also find that both representational spaces are
implicitly aligned to an explicit representation of concreteness, which was
obtained from our participants using an additional concreteness rating task.
Importantly, using ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the human-to-model
alignment is substantially driven by concreteness, but not by other important
word characteristics established in psycholinguistics. These results indicate
that humans and language models converge on the concreteness dimension, but not
on other dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 私有数据分散且高质量，但现有联邦学习方法在隐私、效率和适应性上存在不足。

Method: 采用本地客户端处理输入输出块、注入高斯噪声、并行训练策略、动态调整分割点等技术。

Result: 在NLU、摘要和对话任务中性能接近集中式LLaMA2，训练速度提升2倍，推理速度提升8倍。

Conclusion: FL-LLaMA在隐私、效率和适应性上表现优异，适用于联邦学习环境。

Abstract: Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data,
offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution
across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their
deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based
split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the
server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to
ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,
efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,
leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of
LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,
causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack
adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a
secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.
First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject
Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end
propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies
to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV
cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs
effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points
for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware
limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show
that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and
achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of
privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the
effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

TL;DR: ThinkLess是一个推理高效框架，通过提前终止推理生成减少延迟和内存使用，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示中推理令牌过长导致的延迟、内存占用高及答案截断问题。

Method: 利用注意力分析发现答案令牌主要关注推理终止符，插入终止符提前终止冗余推理，并采用轻量后调节机制保持答案结构。

Result: 在不微调或额外数据的情况下，ThinkLess达到与完整CoT解码相当的准确性，同时显著减少解码时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: ThinkLess通过高效推理设计，平衡了推理质量与资源消耗，为LLMs推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and
KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context
limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates
reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the
model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on
earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token,
due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight,
ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant
reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format
discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight
post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following
ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary
data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while
greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法偏向奖励最大化路径，缺乏外部知识，限制了探索能力和推理边界。

Method: TAPO通过自适应整合结构化思维模式，平衡模型内部探索与外部指导利用。

Result: 在AIME、AMC和Minerva Math上分别超越GRPO 99%、41%和17%，且思维模式仅需500样本即可泛化。

Conclusion: TAPO具有广泛适用性，能生成更具解释性和可读性的推理模型。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training
reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's
output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external
knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower
reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this
limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel
framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance
("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during
training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external
guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva
Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500
prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This
highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and
domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance
produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference
behavior and enhanced output readability.

Abstract: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into
customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex,

traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online
Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol
designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions
effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides
extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive
opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content,
thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive
capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs
exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion
miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for
LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this

Motivation: [CLS]令牌在BERT中常用于分类任务，但其他令牌和中间层也包含有价值信息，需要更高效的表示方法。

Method: 提出MaxPoolBERT，通过三种改进：（1）跨层最大池化[CLS]令牌，（2）添加多头注意力层使[CLS]关注最终层，（3）结合序列最大池化和MHA。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，MaxPoolBERT性能优于标准BERT-base，尤其在低资源任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: MaxPoolBERT在不增加预训练或显著增大模型的情况下，有效提升了分类任务的准确性。

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for
classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and
intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we
propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS]
representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens.
Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token
across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire
final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii)
combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances
BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without
requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on
the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better
performance on the standard BERT-base model.

Motivation: 大语言模型在连续编辑中因缺乏长期知识保留机制导致性能下降，亟需一种能兼顾编辑效果和知识保留的方法。

Method: 将连续编辑建模为约束随机规划问题，结合排队论和Lyapunov优化，分解为可逐步求解的子问题。

Conclusion: LyapLock是首个具有理论保证的模型编辑框架，在长期知识保留和编辑性能上均表现优异，并可增强基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated
knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates.
However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive
performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for
long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential
editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by
the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing
tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov
optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable
stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing
framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal
editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge
preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential
editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities
and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines.
Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline
methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.

*Tianqi Du,Zeming Wei,Quan Chen,Chenheng Zhang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRR的框架，利用大语言模型的内部隐藏状态来评估和选择安全响应，显著提升了对抗性提示的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法仅基于文本响应，忽略了模型内部嵌入的丰富信息，导致潜在的安全隐患。

Method: 提出Safety Representation Ranking (SRR)框架，通过模型的中间表示对指令和候选完成进行编码，并使用轻量级相似性评分器对候选进行排序。

Result: 实验表明，SRR在多个基准测试中显著提高了对对抗性提示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SRR通过直接利用模型内部状态和列表级监督，有效捕捉了细微的安全信号，为LLM安全评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating
harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety
evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses,
overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal
representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR),
a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states
from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions
using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a
lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal
model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety
signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly
improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在复杂叙事环境中识别证词与证据之间矛盾的能力，揭示现有推理增强策略的局限性。

Method: 通过设计长叙事背景下的矛盾识别任务，评估12种先进LLMs的表现，分析上下文大小、推理步骤数和答案空间对性能的影响。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现有限，现有策略如Chain-of-Thought提示效果不佳。

Conclusion: TurnaboutLLM为评估LLMs在复杂叙事环境中的演绎推理能力提供了挑战性基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces TurnaboutLLM, a novel framework and dataset for
evaluating the deductive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
leveraging the interactive gameplay of detective games Ace Attorney and
Danganronpa. The framework tasks LLMs with identifying contradictions between
testimonies and evidences within long narrative contexts, a challenging task
due to the large answer space and diverse reasoning types presented by its
questions. We evaluate twelve state-of-the-art LLMs on the dataset, hinting at
limitations of popular strategies for enhancing deductive reasoning such as
extensive thinking and Chain-of-Thought prompting. The results also suggest
varying effects of context size, the number of reasoning step and answer space
size on model performance. Overall, TurnaboutLLM presents a substantial
challenge for LLMs' deductive reasoning abilities in complex, narrative-rich
environments.

TL;DR: PsyLLM是一个专为心理健康咨询设计的大型语言模型，通过整合诊断和治疗推理，结合国际标准和多种治疗框架，显著优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的心理健康支持方法缺乏临床基础，无法满足实际心理咨询需求，特别是在诊断和治疗推理方面。

Method: 提出自动数据合成流程，处理真实心理健康帖子，生成多轮对话结构，并利用LLM结合DSM/ICD标准和多种治疗框架模拟临床推理。

Result: PsyLLM在全面性、专业性、真实性和安全性四个维度上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyLLM为心理健康咨询提供了更系统、临床化的解决方案，填补了现有LLM方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health
support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic
conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical
grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in
explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and
incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single
strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first
large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and
therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we
propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes
real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and
leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and
multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate
detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering
ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In
addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing
counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness,
professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that
PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this
benchmark.

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面分析了多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）中的记忆现象，发现语言相似性对记忆模式的影响，并提出了一种基于图的相关性度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，理解其记忆行为变得至关重要。然而，以往研究主要关注单语言模型，忽视了多语言记忆的探索。

Method: 研究分析了95种语言，使用不同规模、架构和记忆定义的模型，并提出了一种基于语言相似性的图相关性度量方法。

Result: 研究发现，语言相似性显著影响记忆模式，训练数据较少的相似语言表现出更高的记忆性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言感知视角的重要性，为多语言NLP中的记忆漏洞评估和缓解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual
Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across
diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are
increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become
critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving
multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed
nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that
memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to
fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating
languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true
patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based
correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze
cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,
those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend
that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.
These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in
evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also
constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains
Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad
implications for multilingual NLP.

Result: 实验结果显示当前模型能力存在显著差异，各有优势和不足，为未来语音交互系统研究提供了指导。

Conclusion: VocalBench为语音交互模型的全面评估提供了新工具，有助于推动该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the
development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike
text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including
semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental
context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models
predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, often
overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance and lacking benchmarks with
vocal-specific test instances. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speech interaction models'
capabilities in vocal communication. VocalBench comprises 9,400 carefully
curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic
performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental
skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal
significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct
strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future
research in speech-based interaction systems. Code and evaluation instances are

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型依赖大量数据提升推理能力，但仅靠数据增长已不现实，需探索自主提升方法。

Method: 提出了DTE框架，结合多智能体辩论和Reflect-Critique-Refine提示策略，无监督地优化模型推理。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，DTE平均提升8.92%准确率，并展现出强跨领域泛化能力（平均提升5.8%）。

Conclusion: DTE框架有效提升了语言模型的自主推理能力，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning
through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on
additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical,
highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning
without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve
(DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent
debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new
prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by
explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive
evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that
our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy
gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe
strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on
all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合上下文压缩方法（HyCo$_2$），通过结合全局和局部视角优化LLMs的长序列推理效率，减少冗余处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在长序列推理中存在计算效率低和冗余处理的问题，现有方法容易丢失有价值信息，需要一种更平衡的压缩方法。

Method: HyCo$_2$结合全局语义适配器和局部分类层，通过辅助预训练平衡信息保留。

Result: 实验表明HyCo$_2$显著提升长文本推理性能，平均提高13.1%，同时减少88.8%的token消耗。

Conclusion: HyCo$_2$有效平衡了全局和局部信息保留，显著提升了LLMs的长序列推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in
long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant
processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing
methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or
encode context into latent representations for soft global compression.
However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity
of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the
loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for
LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context
compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details
for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global
semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different
adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer
that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local
view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a
balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary
paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This
promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant
information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing
local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show
that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while
reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an
average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover,
HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token
consumption by 88.8\%.

TL;DR: ConvSearch-R1是一个自驱动的对话查询重构框架，通过强化学习优化检索信号，无需外部监督，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话查询重构方法对外部监督的高依赖性和与下游检索器对齐不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：自驱动策略预热和检索引导的强化学习，结合排名激励奖励机制。

Result: 在TopiOCQA和QReCC数据集上表现优异，TopiOCQA上提升超过10%。

Conclusion: ConvSearch-R1通过自驱动框架有效解决了对话查询重构的挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent
queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational
Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these
queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers.
However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high
dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large
language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and
downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven
framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision
by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through
retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy
Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided
self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a
specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the
sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on
TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement
on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models
without any external supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理模型受限于离散语言令牌，表达能力受限，无法充分探索推理路径。

Method: 通过概率加权的令牌嵌入生成连续的抽象概念令牌，形成连续概念空间，实现平滑过渡和更丰富的表示。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Soft Thinking将pass@1准确率提升2.48分，同时减少22.4%的令牌使用。

Conclusion: Soft Thinking突破了离散语言推理的瓶颈，提供高效且可解释的推理路径。

Abstract: Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts
rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning
models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human
language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in
the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and
upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration
of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling
one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free
method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract
concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created
by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the
continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer
representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,
each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related
discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge
effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse
mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points
while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard
CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain
highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking
to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为延迟KV-Cache的机制，用于加速扩散语言模型（DLMs）的解码过程，显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型因非自回归架构和双向注意力机制导致推理速度慢，缺乏自回归模型中的键值缓存（KV-Cache）加速机制。

Method: 提出了两种延迟和条件化的键值状态缓存策略：dKV-Cache-Decode（几乎无损加速）和dKV-Cache-Greedy（更高速度但性能略有下降）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理速度上实现了2-10倍的提升，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 延迟KV-Cache机制显著缩小了自回归模型与扩散语言模型之间的性能差距，且无需额外训练即可应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for
autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long
been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their
non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the
key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by
proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising
process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different
tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.
Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and
value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value
step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless
acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that
existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2)
dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving
higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance
degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference,
largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on
several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language
understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments
demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner
from current DLMs.

Result: DoveScore在AUC-ROC上优于现有方法8%，提供更鲁棒的评估方案。

Conclusion: DoveScore通过建模事实间关系，显著提升评估鲁棒性，为长文本对齐评估提供新方案。

Abstract: Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks
and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user
trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually
but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this
work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs
deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing
explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based
evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack,
with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained
evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies
factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact
relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%,
providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dannalily/DoveScore.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-judge评估框架易受恶意攻击，如通过调整候选LLM的输出来迎合评委LLM的偏好，因此需要探索更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 利用评委LLM提供的信号作为奖励，通过强化学习对抗性地优化生成前导文本的模型，以间接提升评分。

Result: 优化的前导文本生成模型能显著提高评分，且方法难以检测，同时在未参与训练的模型上也能泛化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM-as-a-judge框架的潜在风险，并提出了一种新的优化方法，为未来更可靠的评估设计和应用提供了启示。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by
other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as
LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also
vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit
the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by
a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them
by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal
provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate
text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen
LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than
existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene
directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers
when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not
used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design
of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that
human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to
optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could
find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved
remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their
training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement
learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate
reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding
of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two
benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the
performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed
through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human
annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room
for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially
smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive
analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and
developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as
effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the
reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在敏感领域的广泛应用，确保其遵守用户定义的安全政策（尤其是信息非披露）变得至关重要。目前缺乏针对上下文安全保护的大规模基准。

Method: 通过构建CoPriva数据集，包含明确政策和直接/间接攻击查询，评估了10个LLM的上下文安全表现。

Result: 许多模型违反政策并泄露敏感信息，尤其是面对间接攻击时表现更差。模型在生成时难以融入政策约束，但部分能在明确提示下修正输出。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在敏感应用中的安全性存在重大缺陷，亟需更鲁棒的方法保障上下文安全。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to
user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with
respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on
general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for
contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address
this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating
LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering.
Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and
queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited
information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant
vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive
information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks,
highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive
applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the

Abstract: Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm,
coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought
reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial
performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis
experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design,
output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising
from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding
tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate
chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse
grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals
or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and
poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy
examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to
under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three
targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages
direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second,
we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate
reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length
normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better
optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on
ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even
outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI
agent grounding. The project repository is available at

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何通过检索增强实现上下文学习，以理解其内部工作机制，从而提升模型的安全性和透明度。

Method: 提出基于归因的方法，识别并分析专门化的注意力头（如上下文头和参数头），并通过修改其注意力权重研究其对答案生成的影响。

Result: 揭示了上下文头和参数头的不同功能，展示了它们如何影响答案生成，并追踪了推理过程中知识的来源。

Conclusion: 研究为理解检索增强的上下文学习机制提供了新视角，有助于开发更安全、透明的语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access
external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation.
While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light
on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by
viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an
attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing
in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual
information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To
better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their
attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process.
Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used
during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Mixture-of-Thought (MoT)框架，通过结合自然语言、代码和符号逻辑（真值表）三种推理模态，提升LLM的逻辑推理能力。实验显示MoT显著优于单模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类使用多种推理模态解决问题，而现有LLM方法通常仅依赖单一模态（如自然语言），限制了模态间的协同效应。

Method: MoT采用两阶段设计：1）自演化的多模态训练；2）推理阶段充分利用三种模态的协同效应。

Result: 在FOLIO和ProofWriter等逻辑推理基准测试中，MoT比单模态方法平均准确率提升高达11.7个百分点。

Conclusion: MoT框架在训练和推理阶段均有效，尤其擅长解决复杂逻辑问题，不同模态互补性强，真值表推理能克服自然语言推理的瓶颈。

Abstract: Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and
solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as
natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing
LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training,
typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection
or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind,
limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose
Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three
complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced
symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases
and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT
adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns
from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT
inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce
better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO
and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and
significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality
chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.
Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and
inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning
problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths,
with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural
language inference.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为LCP1.0的框架，将复杂的病理组学和放射组学特征转化为临床可理解的诊断工具，并通过专家验证提升了AI在肝癌诊断中的透明度和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医学诊断中潜力巨大，但其临床应用受限于缺乏可解释性和泛化性。本研究旨在通过开发LCP1.0框架，解决这一问题。

Method: 使用QuPath和PyRadiomics提取肝癌组织的病理组学和放射组学特征，并通过多分类器和特征选择算法评估其与WHO分级系统的相关性。

Result: 结合SVM模型的Variable Threshold特征选择算法达到最高准确率（0.80），筛选出20个关键特征，这些特征与肿瘤分级和预后密切相关。

Conclusion: LCP1.0为AI输出与专家解释之间提供了临床验证的桥梁，增强了模型的透明度和可用性，支持开发可信赖的肝癌诊断工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds strong potential for medical diagnostics,
yet its clinical adoption is limited by a lack of interpretability and
generalizability. This study introduces the Pathobiological Dictionary for
Liver Cancer (LCP1.0), a practical framework designed to translate complex
Pathomics and Radiomics Features (PF and RF) into clinically meaningful
insights aligned with existing diagnostic workflows. QuPath and PyRadiomics,
standardized according to IBSI guidelines, were used to extract 333 imaging
features from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, including 240
PF-based-cell detection/intensity, 74 RF-based texture, and 19 RF-based
first-order features. Expert-defined ROIs from the public dataset excluded
artifact-prone areas, and features were aggregated at the case level. Their
relevance to the WHO grading system was assessed using multiple classifiers
linked with feature selectors. The resulting dictionary was validated by 8
experts in oncology and pathology. In collaboration with 10 domain experts, we
developed a Pathobiological dictionary of imaging features such as PFs and RF.
In our study, the Variable Threshold feature selection algorithm combined with
the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (0.80, P-value less than 0.05),
selecting 20 key features, primarily clinical and pathomics traits such as
Centroid, Cell Nucleus, and Cytoplasmic characteristics. These features,
particularly nuclear and cytoplasmic, were strongly associated with tumor
grading and prognosis, reflecting atypia indicators like pleomorphism,
hyperchromasia, and cellular orientation.The LCP1.0 provides a clinically
validated bridge between AI outputs and expert interpretation, enhancing model
transparency and usability. Aligning AI-derived features with clinical
semantics supports the development of interpretable, trustworthy diagnostic
tools for liver cancer pathology.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在大型HDL项目中性能受限的问题，通过引入结构信息增强检索能力。

Result: 实验显示HDLxGraph在搜索准确性、调试效率和完成质量上分别提升12.04%、12.22%和5.04%。

Conclusion: HDLxGraph有效提升了LLMs在硬件设计任务中的表现，并提供了HDLSearch基准数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware
design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and
debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects
with thousands or even tens of thousands of code lines is hindered. To this
end, we propose HDLxGraph, a novel framework that integrates Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph
representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow
Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view.
HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the
limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by
incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to
various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally,
to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce
HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world
repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph
significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and
completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based
RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何将Maximal Update Parametrization（μP）推广到扩散Transformer中，验证了其在大规模实验中的有效性，显著降低了调参成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer在视觉生成模型中表现优异，但其大规模扩展受限于高昂的超参数调优成本。研究旨在验证μP方法是否适用于扩散Transformer，以降低成本并提升效率。

Method: 通过理论证明和实验验证，将μP方法推广到主流扩散Transformer（如DiT、U-ViT等），并测试其超参数的可迁移性。

Result: 实验表明，μP方法显著提升了模型性能（如DiT-XL-2收敛速度提升2.9倍），并在文本到图像生成任务中验证了其有效性（如PixArt-α和MMDiT的扩展）。

Conclusion: μP是一种高效且原理清晰的框架，适用于扩散Transformer的扩展，显著降低了调参成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative
models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter
(HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P)
was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from
small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However,
it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion
Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we
generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its
effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that
$\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT,
PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer,
enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging
this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP
transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate
achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling
PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases,
models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small
tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of
consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a
principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Motivation: OoD检测对深度神经网络可靠性至关重要，但现有方法在表征InD和OoD数据差异方面存在不足。本文从非线性特征子空间的新视角出发，探索更有效的差异表征方法。

Method: 利用KPCA框架学习判别性非线性子空间，提出Cosine-Gaussian核函数，并引入两种技术优化大规模InD数据的核矩阵计算。此外，结合InD数据置信度优化子空间学习。

Result: 提出的方法在OoD检测中表现出显著提升的效能和效率，Cosine-Gaussian核函数和计算优化技术有效解决了核函数选择和计算效率问题。

Conclusion: 研究为非线性特征子空间在OoD检测中的应用提供了新见解，并通过核函数设计和高效计算技术实现了更优的检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep
neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the
disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such
disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature
subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD
features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns
of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their
different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations
of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD
detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal
Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and
deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD
data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear
subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the
computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we
reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD
disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for
constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to
approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.
In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD
data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of
discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the
non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical
explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations,
yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 为多维数据提供统一的组合框架，同时保留经典序列建模范式的特性。

Method: 定义每个轴的组合算子 circ_i，确保沿轴的结合性，同时全局算子满足交换律。

Result: 框架能泛化经典序列建模方法（如SSMs和Transformer自注意力），并支持多维递归操作。

Conclusion: 该结构为未来深度学习模型设计提供了理论基础，潜在应用包括结构化位置编码和图像嵌入。

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional
embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core
contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing
theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange
law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine
learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition
operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each
axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific
operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that
enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical
sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and
transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For
example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the
familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the
SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support
recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several
potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured
positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and
symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future
deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of
our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is
theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to
future work, which we plan to undertake.

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address
interpretability in embedded vector spaces where dimensions represent complex
abstractions. We introduce Distance Explainer, a novel method for generating
local, post-hoc explanations of embedded spaces in machine learning models. Our
approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance
between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through
selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance
Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using
established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and
Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our
method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or
dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness
and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask
quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work
addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and
trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

Motivation: 探索扩散去噪平滑技术在不同任务和攻击算法下的有效性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用预训练的扩散模型预处理输入，并在三个数据集上测试四种下游任务和三种对抗攻击算法。

Result: 高噪声扩散去噪会显著降低性能（高达57%），低噪声设置虽保留性能但无法抵御所有攻击。新型攻击策略能绕过低噪声防御。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性与性能之间的权衡仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various
tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores
various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a
pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet,
its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to
address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream
tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal
that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional
transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images
without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%.
Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate
protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack
strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of
circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the
trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to
be addressed.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了SFT的统计效率，为LLM的微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large
language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical
efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples.
Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the
computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The
key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain,
measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it
efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic
regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and
performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back
our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee
correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is
computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model
(EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy
Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to
assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels,
thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting
discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking
candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final
outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks
(GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with
Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively
leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the
performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome
reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Motivation: 现有RL后训练方法中的验证器设计容易受到奖励黑客攻击且泛化能力差，需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Result: 在多个数学推理任务和ProcessBench数据集上取得最佳性能，尤其在困难问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: Tango框架通过生成式验证器和生成器的协同进化，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an
LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,
current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are
fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking
and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently
train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central
innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is
trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is
trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without
requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained
verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to
deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual
reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both
components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:
the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level
math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the
verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit
particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical
reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界预测中多模态数据日益丰富，但现有研究多集中于单模态时间序列。MoTime旨在填补这一空白，推动多模态时间序列预测的全面研究。

Method: 提出MoTime数据集，涵盖多种领域，支持两种场景（常规预测和冷启动预测）下模态效用的结构化评估。

Result: 外部模态在两种场景下均能提升预测性能，部分数据集中短序列效果尤为显著，但效果因数据特性而异。

Conclusion: MoTime的公开数据集和发现旨在支持未来多模态时间序列预测的更全面和现实基准研究。

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world
forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this
work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets
that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and
images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of
modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where
varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no
historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can
improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong
benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending
on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we
aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal
time series forecasting research.

### [265] [SUS backprop: linear backpropagation algorithm for long inputs in transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15080)
*Sergey Pankov,Georges Harik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过随机切断反向传播路径以减少计算量的方法，特别适用于Transformer中的注意力机制，将复杂度从O(n²)降至O(nc)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列中注意力机制的计算复杂度高，且大多数注意力权重较小，适合切断以减少计算量。

Method: 提出基于概率的规则，通过参数c控制每个token和注意力头的反向传播路径，最多保留c个交互。

Result: 实验表明，切断99%的注意力梯度流仅增加1%的梯度方差，且计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效减少反向传播计算量，适用于长序列Transformer训练。

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that
stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a
computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the
computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation
computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient
variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention
mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention
becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically
with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very
small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small
fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising
targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule
controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most
attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention
head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the
attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear
complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical
transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing
$c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about
$1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable
to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the
cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when
training a transformer model on long sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PKPO的方法，通过优化pass@k性能来提升强化学习中的样本多样性和集体效用，解决了传统方法仅优化pass@1的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法独立奖励每个样本，导致样本多样性和集体效用不足，限制了在复杂问题上的表现。

Method: 提出PKPO方法，通过变换最终奖励直接优化pass@k性能，并推导了低方差无偏估计器。

Result: 实验验证了PKPO的有效性，尤其在复杂任务上表现出色，同时支持动态调整k值以平衡pass@1和pass@k性能。

Conclusion: PKPO通过优化样本集的联合效用，显著提升了强化学习的探索能力和性能，尤其在复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts
for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1
performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of
the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes
the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder
examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a
transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of
pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward
when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance
unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and
continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to
standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and
efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable
robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of
trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k
during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1
numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the
variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world
examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation
effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable
solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and
pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1
optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to
better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual
samples.

TL;DR: ReGUIDE是一种新型框架，通过自生成推理和空间感知批评，显著提高了多模态大语言模型在GUI元素定位中的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模数据集提高GUI元素定位精度，但效率低下。ReGUIDE旨在通过数据高效学习解决这一问题。

Method: ReGUIDE结合在线强化学习自生成语言推理过程，并利用空间先验批评预测，测试时通过空间搜索和坐标聚合提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，ReGUIDE在多个基准测试中表现优异，仅需0.2%的训练数据即可超越基线。

Conclusion: ReGUIDE为GUI元素定位提供了一种高效、数据节约的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements
(e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this
remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale
web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose
Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a
novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn
data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism.
More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning
process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii)
criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under
input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance
through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with
coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly
advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming
baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2%
samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

*Yurun Yuan,Fan Chen,Zeyu Jia,Alexander Rakhlin,Tengyang Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TBRM是一种基于贝尔曼残差最小化的价值强化学习方法，适用于大语言模型推理，无需评论家或重要性采样，性能优于策略基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索价值强化学习在大语言模型推理中的应用，填补当前以策略方法为主的空白。

Method: 提出TBRM算法，通过轨迹级贝尔曼目标优化，利用模型自身logits作为Q值，简化了计算流程。

Result: 实验表明TBRM在数学推理任务中优于PPO和GRPO，计算和内存开销更低。

Conclusion: 价值强化学习可能是提升大语言模型推理能力的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines
for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches
largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual
Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an
algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet
effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman
objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for
critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one
rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized
policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved
change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard
mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms
policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower
computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL
might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning
capabilities in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在选项顺序不同时表现出偏好差异，影响其在多选问答和自动评估中的可靠性。

Method: 引入Set-LLM架构，设计新的注意力掩码和位置编码，确保输入集合的排列不变性。

Result: 实验证明Set-LLM有效消除顺序敏感性，性能与原模型相当或更好，且运行时间不变。

Conclusion: Set-LLM为LLMs的顺序敏感性问题提供了实用解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across
numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper
is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This
vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide
between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and
the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered.
The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of
multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators
in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce
Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the
processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The
adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings
specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance
and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively,
achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the
original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的“grokking”现象（延迟泛化），发现嵌入层是导致这一现象的关键因素。通过分析嵌入更新动态和双线性耦合机制，提出了频率感知采样和嵌入特定学习率的方法，以优化训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络中“grokking”现象的成因，特别是在嵌入层中的作用，以改进训练效率和泛化性能。

Method: 在模块化算术任务中，通过引入嵌入层观察延迟泛化现象，分析嵌入更新动态和双线性耦合机制，并提出频率感知采样和嵌入特定学习率的方法。

Result: 发现嵌入层是导致延迟泛化的关键，提出的方法能够有效缓解双线性耦合效应，加速收敛，并适用于Transformer优化。

Conclusion: 嵌入层在“grokking”现象中起核心作用，通过优化嵌入更新和学习率可以显著改善训练动态和泛化性能。

Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training
performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components
driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to
grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular
arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately.
Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics,
where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and
(2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream
weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization.
To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which
balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific
learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss
landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio,
\(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot
\frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating
convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to
broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions
hinder efficient training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论框架无法统一解释LLM的涌现现象，需要建立与算法信息理论的联系。

Method: 通过证明LLM训练过程近似Solomonoff先验和预测任务近似Solomonoff归纳，利用AIT解释上下文学习、少样本学习和缩放定律。

Result: 实验表明，基于低预测置信度的少样本选择策略显著提升了性能，尤其对小模型。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了理论与实践的鸿沟，为未来模型开发提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous
theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant
progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical
frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified
mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM
architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two
fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates
Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length
optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff
induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for
in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our
theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection
that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We
demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that
this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for
smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence
examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and
practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable
insights for future model development.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their
struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world

overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework
that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with
dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's
core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by
establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct
structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage
for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline},
employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and
\textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel
multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool
invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark
demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by
\textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while
markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation
studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various
benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a
promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous

Conclusion: AGNOSTOS和X-ICM为通用机器人操作研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to
unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in
open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of
existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS
comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common
training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization
difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current
VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize
effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large
language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict
action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided
sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing
cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task
zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and
X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic
manipulation.

Conclusion: 元认知学习可以促进机器人规划中的创造性，为LLMs在机器人领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various
domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static,
prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks
under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning
and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a
fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive
capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to
perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an
early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered
multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered
robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that
identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task
scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show
that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly
outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is
capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still
successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis
that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general
reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment
robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist
visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the
reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to
enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual
Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human
tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual
and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper
aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot
trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses
scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot,
task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate
representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions -
based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question
templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710
questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks
from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can
benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大规模合成动脉瘤CFD数据集的机器学习方法，以解决传统CFD计算耗时的问题，并促进动脉瘤研究和临床风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤（IAs）破裂可能导致高死亡率，而当前风险评估方法对血流动力学影响的研究不足。传统CFD方法计算量大，难以用于大规模或实时临床应用。

Method: 通过427个真实动脉瘤几何形状合成10,660个3D形状模拟动脉瘤演变，生成85,280个血流动力学数据，并引入基准测试评估建模方法。

Result: 生成了包含血流动力学参数、分割掩码等多模态数据的大规模数据集，支持机器学习算法的开发。

Conclusion: 该数据集和代码公开，旨在推动动脉瘤研究和数据驱动的生物流体、生物医学工程及临床风险评估方法。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in
approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high
mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and
patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and
rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive,
hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications.
To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD
dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms
for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized
10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The
authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD
computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow
conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key
parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can
support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input.
Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to
assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research
and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and
clinical risk assessment. The code and dataset are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在医学领域生成描述时表现泛泛或不精确，需要针对性改进。

Method: 微调BLIP模型并与零样本版本、BLIP-2基线和ViT-GPT2进行比较，同时分析编码器和解码器微调的贡献。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升性能，解码器微调（编码器冻结）在训练时间减少5%的情况下表现良好，但全模型微调效果最佳。

Conclusion: 医学应用需针对性微调，解码器微调是高效选择，但全模型微调效果最优。

Abstract: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating
clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology
images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini
and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often
produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical
domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP
model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the
fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and
a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific
fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative
and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention
maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the
contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings
highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and
suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong
performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while
full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of
Detail 1 (LOD1), plays a crucial role in various applications such as urban
planning, urban environmental studies, and designing optimized transportation
networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for
accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological
features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net,
Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning
to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+
and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and
0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range,
mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights,
resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of
the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building
modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and
external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the
accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly
affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features,
depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method,
utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height
estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: TransMedSeg提出了一种新的半监督医学图像分割框架，通过跨域语义对齐和域内结构保留，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在医学图像分割中忽视了跨临床领域和成像模态的可转移语义关系。

Method: 引入可转移语义增强（TSA）模块，通过跨域分布匹配和域内结构保护对齐域不变语义，构建统一特征空间。

Result: 在医学图像数据集上，TransMedSeg优于现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: TransMedSeg为医学图像分析中的可转移表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical
image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled
data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook
transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and
imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel
transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module,
which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant
semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain
structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature
space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student
network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic
transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this
augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable
cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper
bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during
training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on
medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing
semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable
representation learning in medical image analysis.

optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when
extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning

positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models.
Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times
better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple
design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses,
including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation
protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging,
materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how
machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise
information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific
applications.

Abstract: We propose an OCT super-resolution framework based on a plug-and-play
diffusion model (PnP-DM) to reconstruct high-quality images from sparse
measurements (OCT B-mode corneal images). Our method formulates reconstruction
as an inverse problem, combining a diffusion prior with Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampling for efficient posterior inference. We collect high-speed
under-sampled B-mode corneal images and apply a deep learning-based up-sampling
pipeline to build realistic training pairs. Evaluations on in vivo and ex vivo
fish-eye corneal models show that PnP-DM outperforms conventional 2D-UNet
baselines, producing sharper structures and better noise suppression. This
approach advances high-fidelity OCT imaging in high-speed acquisition for
clinical applications.

Result: 在真实心脏MRI数据集和复杂模拟变形数据上表现优异，即使运动状态下采样率低至64倍。

Conclusion: 该方法对采样模式、解剖变异和扫描协议具有鲁棒性，适用于低频采样的动态MRI。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts
due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These
artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging.
We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke
diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted
k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to
capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image
first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of
standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on
both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and
non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor
of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical
variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency
components are sampled during each motion state.

Conclusion: LungNodule-SSM方法在肺结节检测中表现优异，为自监督学习在医学影像中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades,
and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The
limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in
developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised
learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more
robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture
and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort
within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream
tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes
selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule
detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two
stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn
robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned
using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate
lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the
challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA
methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method
with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule
detection. The source code, datasets, and pre-processed data can be accessed

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过SC-FC耦合和多视图GNN，为精神分裂症研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Clinical studies reveal disruptions in brain structural connectivity (SC) and
functional connectivity (FC) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia (SZ). Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to
limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and
behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC
interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided
deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe
the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which
operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed
framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling
from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view
graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC
fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a
clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness
of our proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型计算效率低且难以平衡局部与全局特征，SSMs的应用受限于图像令牌和自回归假设。

Method: 提出SAMA-UNet架构，包含SAMA块（结合上下文自注意力与动态权重调制）和CR-MSM模块（通过因果共振学习优化多尺度信息流）。

Result: 在MRI、CT和内窥镜图像上的实验显示，SAMA-UNet在分割精度上优于CNN、Transformer和Mamba。

Conclusion: SAMA-UNet通过创新模块设计有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical
applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational
inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space
Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range
dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in
medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image
tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a
balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic
dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel
architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the
Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates
contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most
relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces
computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image
features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance
Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the
encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows
the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies
across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and
high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and
endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy
than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is
publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Computed Tomography serves as an indispensable tool in clinical workflows,
providing non-invasive visualization of internal anatomical structures.
Existing CT reconstruction works are limited to small-capacity model
architecture, inflexible volume representation, and small-scale training data.
In this paper, we present X-GRM (X-ray Gaussian Reconstruction Model), a large
feedforward model for reconstructing 3D CT from sparse-view 2D X-ray
projections. X-GRM employs a scalable transformer-based architecture to encode
an arbitrary number of sparse X-ray inputs, where tokens from different views
are integrated efficiently. Then, tokens are decoded into a new volume
representation, named Voxel-based Gaussian Splatting (VoxGS), which enables
efficient CT volume extraction and differentiable X-ray rendering. To support
the training of X-GRM, we collect ReconX-15K, a large-scale CT reconstruction
dataset containing around 15,000 CT/X-ray pairs across diverse organs,
including the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and tooth etc. This combination of a
high-capacity model, flexible volume representation, and large-scale training
data empowers our model to produce high-quality reconstructions from various
testing inputs, including in-domain and out-domain X-ray projections. Project

Abstract: Mesh reconstruction is a cornerstone process across various applications,
including in-silico trials, digital twins, surgical planning, and navigation.
Recent advancements in deep learning have notably enhanced mesh reconstruction
speeds. Yet, traditional methods predominantly rely on deforming a standardised
template mesh for individual subjects, which overlooks the unique anatomical
variations between them, and may compromise the fidelity of the
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-template-based mesh
reconstruction network (ATMRN), which generates adaptive templates from the
given images for the subsequent deformation, moving beyond the constraints of a
singular, fixed template. Our approach, validated on cortical magnetic
resonance (MR) images from the OASIS dataset, sets a new benchmark in
voxel-to-cortex mesh reconstruction, achieving an average symmetric surface
distance of 0.267mm across four cortical structures. Our proposed method is
generic and can be easily transferred to other image modalities and anatomical
structures.

Abstract: Cervical cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer in women globally,
requires early detection through Pap smear tests to identify precancerous
changes and prevent disease progression. In this study, we performed a focused
analysis by segmenting the cellular boundaries and drawing bounding boxes to
isolate the cancer cells. A novel Deep Learning (DL) architecture, the
``Multi-Resolution Fusion Deep Convolutional Network", was proposed to
effectively handle images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, with its
efficacy showcased using the SIPaKMeD dataset. The performance of this DL model
was observed to be similar to the state-of-the-art models, with accuracy
variations of a mere 2\% to 3\%, achieved using just 1.7 million learnable
parameters, which is approximately 85 times less than the VGG-19 model.
Furthermore, we introduced a multi-task learning technique that simultaneously
performs segmentation and classification tasks and begets an Intersection over
Union score of 0.83 and a classification accuracy of 90\%. The final stage of
the workflow employs a probabilistic approach for risk assessment, extracting
feature vectors to predict the likelihood of normal cells progressing to
malignant states, which can be utilized for the prognosis of cervical cancer.

Motivation: 传统情感分析工具在软件工程领域未能充分处理语言的细微差别和上下文依赖性，因此需要评估更先进的模型。

Method: 使用GitHub、Stack Overflow和Jira的数据集，对BERT和GPT-4o-mini进行微调和默认配置的基准测试。

Result: 微调的GPT-4o-mini在结构化数据集上表现与BERT相当（F1分数0.93和0.98），但在复杂数据集上默认配置表现更优（准确率85.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型架构与数据集特性匹配的重要性，并提出了优化软件工程情感分析工具的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer
interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software
engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have
made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and
context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against
generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment
analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark
the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The
results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and
other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and
Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively.
However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment
distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits
superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the
fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between
fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study
underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset
characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future
research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个框架BountyBench，用于评估AI代理在网络安全中的攻防能力，通过25个真实系统测试了5种AI代理在漏洞检测、利用和修复任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解AI代理如何改变网络安全格局，并提供一个量化评估攻防能力的框架。

Method: 构建BountyBench框架，设置25个真实系统，定义三种任务类型（检测、利用、修复），并设计新的评估指标。

Result: Claude Code和OpenAI Codex CLI在防御任务中表现更优，而自定义代理在攻防平衡上更佳。

Conclusion: AI代理在网络安全中具有潜力，但攻防能力差异显著，需进一步优化。

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity
landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework
to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world
systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems
with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we
define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit
(exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific
vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is
general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We
manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages,
setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which
are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of
the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy
based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero
day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing
agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on
Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch,
mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at
defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit
scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are
relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of
40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.

TL;DR: 本文评估了当前基于对齐的防御方法的鲁棒性，提出了一种利用中间模型检查点初始化GCG攻击的改进方法，证明现有防御方法存在脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有防御方法声称能抵御GCG等攻击，但攻击者在掌握对齐过程信息时可能更高效地发起攻击。本文旨在验证这种威胁模型的可行性。

Method: 提出一种基于中间模型检查点的初始化方法，结合梯度信息选择检查点，改进GCG攻击的效果和效率。

Result: 该方法在多种防御和模型上表现优异，成功找到通用对抗后缀，证明现有防御方法存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前基于对齐的防御方法脆弱，需考虑更强的威胁模型以确保LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications
ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main
approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and
jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even
against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates
adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search
space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding
successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to
local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we
assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed
threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment
process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the
intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting
as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly
effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show
our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show
a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack
performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to
successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective
across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,
effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,
that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit
alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,
our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and
the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文检索的安全防护方法（SCR），用于增强大型语言模型（LLM）对越狱攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态防御机制难以应对不断演变的越狱攻击技术，因此需要一种更灵活、可扩展的防御方法。

Method: 通过初步研究发现少量安全对齐的示例能显著提升防御能力，进而结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，提出了SCR方法。

Result: 实验表明，SCR能有效防御已知和新兴的越狱攻击，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCR为LLM安全提供了一种新的可扩展且鲁棒的防御范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking
attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce
harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns
about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While
existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent
advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods
to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense
frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking
threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary
study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against
a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack
pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a
scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive
performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,
contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon
publication.

TL;DR: AsynFusion是一种基于扩散变换器的新型框架，用于协调生成音频驱动的全身虚拟形象表情和姿势，解决了现有方法中表情与手势不协调的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全身音频驱动的虚拟形象生成在虚拟现实等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法因表情和手势独立生成导致动画不自然。

Method: 采用双分支DiT架构，引入协作同步模块和异步LCM采样策略，实现表情与手势的并行生成与协调。

Result: 实验表明，AsynFusion在实时同步全身动画生成中表现优异，定量和定性评估均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AsynFusion通过协调表情与手势生成，显著提升了动画的自然性和一致性，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical
task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of
interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality,
digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often
generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which
introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between
facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive
animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel
framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious
expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a
dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial
expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative
Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between
the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance
in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently
outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.

Result: MIKU-PAL达到人类水平准确性（68.5% MELD评分）和高一致性（0.93 Fleiss kappa评分），并支持26种细粒度情感标注。

Conclusion: MIKU-PAL为情感语音合成提供了高质量、灵活且一致的标注工具，并发布了新基准数据集MIKU-EmoBench。

Abstract: Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a
challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated
multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from
unlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we
developed an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large
language model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve
human-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss
kappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With
the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can
annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by
human annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we
further released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2
hours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice
cloning.

Result: 展示了方法在多个领域中的有效性，能够准确预测实体排名。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨领域性能预测提供了实用工具，减少了评估成本。

Abstract: Frequently, multiple entities (methods, algorithms, procedures, solutions,
etc.) can be developed for a common task and applied across various domains
that differ in the distribution of scenarios encountered. For example, in
computer vision, the input data provided to image analysis methods depend on
the type of sensor used, its location, and the scene content. However, a
crucial difficulty remains: can we predict which entities will perform best in
a new domain based on assessments on known domains, without having to carry out
new and costly evaluations? This paper presents an original methodology to
address this question, in a leave-one-domain-out fashion, for various
application-specific preferences. We illustrate its use with 30 strategies to
predict the rankings of 40 entities (unsupervised background subtraction
methods) on 53 domains (videos).

Result: ModelingAgent表现优于基线，解决方案接近人类专家水平。

Conclusion: 该研究为开放式跨学科建模问题提供了全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial
advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often
fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended,
interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address
this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring
real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across
diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource
planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal
mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing
structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid
solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We
also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use,
supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to
generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further
propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as
domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert
perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially
outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable
from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in
open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

Motivation: 探索RL训练的大型推理模型在节省思考时的内部机制，以提高效率。

Result: NT模式减少输出长度但降低准确性，ET和IT模式在保持准确性的同时减少响应长度。

Conclusion: RL优化的LRMs存在不一致性，需适应性改进以提高可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly advanced performance on
complex tasks, yet their tendency to overthink introduces inefficiencies. This
study investigates the internal mechanisms of reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained LRMs when prompted to save thinking, revealing three distinct
thinking modes: no thinking (NT), explicit thinking (ET), and implicit thinking
(IT). Through comprehensive analysis of confidence in thinking termination,
attention from thinking to generation, and attentional focus on input sections,
we uncover key factors influencing the reasoning behaviors. We further find
that NT reduces output length at the cost of accuracy, while ET and IT maintain
accuracy with reduced response length. Our findings expose fundamental
inconsistencies in RL-optimized LRMs, necessitating adaptive improvements for
reliable efficiency.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务上存在冗余推理问题，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出ASRR框架，利用准确性感知长度奖励调节，根据问题难度自适应分配推理资源。

Result: ASRR在多个基准测试中减少推理资源消耗达32.5%，性能损失仅为1.2%。

Conclusion: ASRR为大型推理模型提供了高效、自适应且安全的推理解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long
reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to
redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we
systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and
No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery
Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer
generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery
Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables
implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR
adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty,
achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments
across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR
reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal
accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates
on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of
ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点击流数据高维且复杂，传统方法缺乏通用性和可扩展性，需要一种更高效的解释方法。

Method: 提出ClickSight，利用LLM从原始点击流和学习策略列表中生成行为解释，评估了四种提示策略和自我优化的效果。

Result: LLM能合理解释学习策略，但效果因提示策略而异，自我优化改进有限。

Conclusion: ClickSight展示了LLM在教育数据中生成理论驱动洞察的潜力。

Abstract: Clickstream data from digital learning environments offer valuable insights
into students' learning behaviors, but are challenging to interpret due to
their high dimensionality and granularity. Prior approaches have relied mainly
on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models,
therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we
introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline
that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies.
ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input
and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during
interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate
the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans
two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert
evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning
strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting
strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from
educational interaction data.

Motivation: ComBAT是MRI数据标准化的常用方法，但其假设条件可能导致结果偏差，需进一步优化。

Method: 通过修改版的Pairwise-ComBAT实验，评估人口规模、年龄分布等因素的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了不同因素对结果的影响，并提出了五项改进建议。

Conclusion: 五项建议可提升ComBAT的稳定性和可重复性，支持开放科学和临床部署。

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing
MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related
additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability.
However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result
in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's
mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their
implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of
ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we
assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population
size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of
additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present
five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance
consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open
science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化方法DF-FLOPS，用于减少高文档频率（DF）术语的使用，从而降低检索延迟，同时保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高DF术语会增加检索延迟，现有方法如FLOPS正则化无法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DF-FLOPS正则化技术，惩罚高DF术语的使用，缩短倒排索引的列表长度。

Result: DF-FLOPS显著减少高DF术语的使用，检索延迟降低约10倍，同时保持检索效果。

Conclusion: DF-FLOPS为LSR模型在生产环境中的实际部署提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors,
which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval.
SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage
vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure
sparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very
high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production
retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To
address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS
regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage
of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval
latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword
removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of
high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that
DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers
retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while
maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and
cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested).
With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step
towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.

Conclusion: MIRB为数学信息检索系统提供了一个全面的评估框架，有助于推动针对数学领域的更有效检索模型的开发。

Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving
information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various
applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer
retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving.
However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has
been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information
Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB
includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval,
premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We
evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges
inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for
evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective
retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.

### [308] [QUADS: QUAntized Distillation Framework for Efficient Speech Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14723)
*Subrata Biswas,Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,Bashima Islam*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: QUADS是一个统一框架，通过多阶段训练结合蒸馏和量化，优化SLU系统在资源受限环境中的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别应用蒸馏和量化，导致压缩效果不佳，因为蒸馏忽略了量化约束。

Method: 提出QUADS框架，通过多阶段训练和预调模型，同时优化蒸馏和量化，适应低比特环境。

Result: 在SLURP和FSC数据集上分别达到71.13%和99.20%的准确率，计算复杂度降低60-73倍，模型大小减少83-700倍。

Conclusion: QUADS在极端量化下表现稳健，是资源受限SLU应用的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and
efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods
apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal
compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS,
a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a
pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining
accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with
only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models.
Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and
model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme
quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for
real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

### [309] [TCSinger 2: Customizable Multilingual Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14910)
*Yu Zhang,Wenxiang Guo,Changhao Pan,Dongyu Yao,Zhiyuan Zhu,Ziyue Jiang,Yuhan Wang,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: TCSinger 2是一个多任务多语言零样本歌声合成模型，通过风格迁移和多样化提示实现风格控制，解决了现有模型对音素和音符边界注释的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌声合成模型在零样本场景中表现不佳，且缺乏多级风格控制能力，TCSinger 2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TCSinger 2包含三个关键模块：模糊边界内容编码器、自定义音频编码器和基于流的自定义Transformer，分别处理平滑过渡、对齐表示和风格建模。

Result: 实验表明，TCSinger 2在主观和客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TCSinger 2通过改进的模块设计和风格控制能力，显著提升了零样本歌声合成的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various
potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However,
existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations,
limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions
between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level
style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer
and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three
key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration,
extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable
smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to
extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3)
Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision,
enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated
singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline
models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

### [310] [Segmentation-Variant Codebooks for Preservation of Paralinguistic and Prosodic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15667)
*Nicholas Sanders,Yuanchao Li,Korin Richmond,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Segmentation-Variant Codebooks (SVCs)的方法，通过在不同语言单元（帧、音素、单词、语句）上量化语音，有效保留韵律和副语言信息，同时避免了传统方法中增加码本大小带来的高比特率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SSL语音模型（如HuBERT）在量化过程中往往丢失韵律和副语言信息（如情感、重音），而增加码本大小虽然能部分缓解这一问题，但会导致比特率上升。

Method: 提出Segmentation-Variant Codebooks (SVCs)，在不同语言单元（帧、音素、单词、语句）上分别量化语音，生成多个分段特定的离散特征流。此外，研究发现离散化前进行池化比离散化后更能保留分段级信息。

Result: 实验表明，SVCs在多种探测任务中显著更有效地保留了韵律和副语言信息。重合成实验进一步证实了其能更好地实现语音风格，同时略微提升质量并保持可懂度。

Conclusion: SVCs通过分段变体码本量化语音，显著提升了韵律和副语言信息的保留效果，同时避免了传统方法的高比特率问题，为语音任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization in SSL speech models (e.g., HuBERT) improves compression and
performance in tasks like language modeling, resynthesis, and text-to-speech
but often discards prosodic and paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion,
prominence). While increasing codebook size mitigates some loss, it
inefficiently raises bitrates. We propose Segmentation-Variant Codebooks
(SVCs), which quantize speech at distinct linguistic units (frame, phone, word,
utterance), factorizing it into multiple streams of segment-specific discrete
features. Our results show that SVCs are significantly more effective at
preserving prosodic and paralinguistic information across probing tasks.
Additionally, we find that pooling before rather than after discretization
better retains segment-level information. Resynthesis experiments further
confirm improved style realization and slightly improved quality while
preserving intelligibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出ToxicTone数据集和一种多模态检测框架，填补了普通话语音毒性检测的空白，并证明了语音特征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本毒性检测，而普通话语音毒性检测缺乏标注数据集和针对性方法。

Method: 引入ToxicTone数据集，结合声学、语言和情感特征，提出多模态检测框架。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于纯文本和基线模型，验证了语音特征的关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究填补了普通话语音毒性检测的空白，强调了多模态方法的重要性。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on toxic speech detection in text, a critical gap
remains in handling spoken Mandarin audio. The lack of annotated datasets that
capture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in
Mandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed
annotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)
and sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,
sourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,
mirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal
detection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional
features using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models,
underscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden
toxic expressions.

TL;DR: AI技术有潜力提升特殊教育需求儿童的包容性教育和临床康复环境，但需系统性生态视角和伦理考量。研究提出基于能力方法的参与式策略，通过ARTIS项目案例展示如何整合伦理、教育和技术设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何支持特殊教育需求儿童的学习和康复，同时解决伦理和技术挑战。

Method: 采用参与式研究策略，结合伦理、教育、临床和技术专家，通过焦点小组和协作设计会议开发AI技术。

Result: 提出了一种基于能力方法的框架，强调功能性和技术适应性，并通过ARTIS项目验证其可行性。

Conclusion: 通过整合伦理与技术，AI在教育中的应用可以弥合创新与责任之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: AI-based technologies have significant potential to enhance inclusive
education and clinical-rehabilitative contexts for children with Special
Educational Needs and Disabilities. AI can enhance learning experiences,
empower students, and support both teachers and rehabilitators. However, their
usage presents challenges that require a systemic-ecological vision, ethical
considerations, and participatory research. Therefore, research and
technological development must be rooted in a strong ethical-theoretical
framework. The Capability Approach - a theoretical model of disability, human
vulnerability, and inclusion - offers a more relevant perspective on
functionality, effectiveness, and technological adequacy in inclusive learning
environments. In this paper, we propose a participatory research strategy with
different stakeholders through a case study on the ARTIS Project, which
develops an AI-enriched interface to support children with text comprehension
difficulties. Our research strategy integrates ethical, educational, clinical,
and technological expertise in designing and implementing AI-based technologies
for children's learning environments through focus groups and collaborative
design sessions. We believe that this holistic approach to AI adoption in
education can help bridge the gap between technological innovation and ethical
responsibility.

TL;DR: 开发了一种深度学习模型，利用H&E染色活检图像预测TNBC患者对新辅助化疗的反应，模型表现优异，并揭示了与免疫生物标志物的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TNBC缺乏靶向治疗选择，准确预测NACT反应对优化治疗和改善患者预后至关重要。

Method: 使用深度学习模型分析H&E染色活检图像，结合mIHC数据验证模型关注区域与免疫生物标志物的关联。

Result: 模型在五折交叉验证中表现优异（准确率82%，AUC 0.86），高预测重要性与PD-L1表达、CD8+ T细胞浸润等生物标志物一致。

Conclusion: 结合IHC免疫分析数据可提升模型解释性和预测性能，为TNBC个性化治疗提供新方向。

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the
lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, resulting in limited targeted
treatment options. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the standard treatment
for early-stage TNBC, with pathologic complete response (pCR) serving as a key
prognostic marker; however, only 40-50% of patients with TNBC achieve pCR.
Accurate prediction of NACT response is crucial to optimize therapy, avoid
ineffective treatments, and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we
developed a deep learning model to predict NACT response using pre-treatment
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy images. Our model achieved promising
results in five-fold cross-validation (accuracy: 82%, AUC: 0.86, F1-score:
0.84, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.81, precision: 0.80). Analysis of model
attention maps in conjunction with multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data
revealed that regions of high predictive importance consistently colocalized
with tumor areas showing elevated PD-L1 expression, CD8+ T-cell infiltration,
and CD163+ macrophage density - all established biomarkers of treatment
response. Our findings indicate that incorporating IHC-derived immune profiling
data could substantially improve model interpretability and predictive
performance. Furthermore, this approach may accelerate the discovery of novel
histopathological biomarkers for NACT and advance the development of
personalized treatment strategies for TNBC patients.

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于模型的评估系统（如LLM-as-a-Judge）对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分则无此差异，揭示了评估中的“调节偏差”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型评估系统（如LLM-as-a-Judge）在伦理拒绝和技术拒绝上的评分差异，揭示其与人类用户评价的分歧。

Method: 利用Chatbot Arena数据和两种AI模型（GPT-4o和Llama 3 70B）的评估结果，比较伦理拒绝和技术拒绝的评分差异。

Result: 模型评估系统对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分无显著差异，表现出“调节偏差”。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型评估系统在伦理拒绝上的评分偏差，引发了对自动化评估系统的透明度、价值对齐和规范假设的思考。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those
involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content
moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed
as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research
suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated
assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and
training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used
to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking
and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess
refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot
Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how
different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which
explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that
because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system
limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find
that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more
favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.
We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for
model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.
This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the
normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.
