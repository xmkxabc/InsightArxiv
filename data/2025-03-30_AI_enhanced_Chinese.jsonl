However, as the scale of KGs increases, manually\nannotating pre-aligned seed pairs becomes difficult. Existing research utilizes\nentity embeddings obtained by aggregating single structural information to\nidentify potential seed pairs, thus reducing the reliance on pre-aligned seed\npairs. However, due to the structural heterogeneity of KGs, the quality of\npotential seed pairs obtained using only a single structural information is not\nideal. In addition, although existing research improves the quality of\npotential seed pairs through semi-supervised iteration, they underestimate the\nimpact of embedding distortion produced by noisy seed pairs on the alignment\neffect. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a seed expanded-aware\ngraph neural network with iterative optimization for semi-supervised entity\nalignment, named SE-GNN. First, we utilize the semantic attributes and\nstructural features of entities, combined with a conditional filtering\nmechanism, to obtain high-quality initial potential seed pairs.

We\nexplore this with the English dative alternation (DO: \"gave Y the X\" vs. PO:\n\"gave the X to Y\"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively\ntrain small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on properties\nthat affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are\ndirectly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter\nelements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates.

Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC)\naddresses this limitation, yet existing methods struggle to align multimodal\nfeatures and explain why emotions evolve within dialogues.

Additionally, the Dialogical Emotion Decoder (DED) refines emotion\npredictions by modelling contextual dependencies.

Most of\nthe existing SSDG methods rely on pseudo-labeling (PL) for unlabeled data,\noften assuming access to domain labels-a privilege not always available.\nHowever, domain shifts introduce domain noise, leading to inconsistent PLs that\ndegrade model performance. Methods derived from FixMatch suffer particularly\nfrom lower PL accuracy, reducing the effectiveness of unlabeled data. To\naddress this, we tackle the more challenging domain-label agnostic SSDG, where\ndomain labels for unlabeled data are not available during training. First, we\npropose a feature modulation strategy that enhances class-discriminative\nfeatures while suppressing domain-specific information. This modulation shifts\nfeatures toward Similar Average Representations-a modified version of class\nprototypes-that are robust across domains, encouraging the classifier to\ndistinguish between closely related classes and feature extractor to form\ntightly clustered, domain-invariant representations.

Our approach\nhighlights the safety and reliability of referencing information over its\ninterpretation and response generation. Seven doctors from the ward assessed\nthe chatbot's performance by comparing its answers to the gold standard.\n  Results: Our chatbot demonstrates promising performance in terms of\nrelevance, with ~73% of its responses rated as very relevant, showcasing a\nstrong understanding of the clinical context. Importantly, our chatbot achieves\na recall of 0.98 for extracted guideline lines, substantially minimising the\nrisk of missing critical information.

Especially for\nframing in the news, this leaves out valuable information about editorial\nchoices, which include not just the written article but also accompanying\nphotographs.

As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI\nagents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring\nexplicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on\nthe visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs),\nleading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that\nrequire multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex\nspatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which\nmay require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs\nand may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally,\nbeing primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they\nscale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an\nagent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS\nwithout LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time\ndigital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the\nconstruction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using\nspecialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin\nas \"just-in-time\" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific\ninformation and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating\nevery specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin\nrepresentation to identify target objects.

Through an ensemble\nmethodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we\ndemonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold\nhigher visual similarity to the Indus script (61.7%-63.5%) than to the Bronze\nAge Proto-Cuneiform (10.2%-10.9%) or Proto-Elamite (7.6%-8.7%) systems.\nAdditionally and contrarily to our current understanding of the networks of the\nIndus Valley Civilization, the Indus script unexpectedly maps closer to\nTibetan-Yi Corridor scripts, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.629, than to\nthe aforementioned contemporaneous West Asian signaries, both of which recorded\nmean cosine similarities of 0.104 and 0.080 despite their close geographic\nproximity and evident trade relations. Across various dimensionality reduction\npractices and clustering methodologies, the Indus script consistently clusters\nclosest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts.

However, existing methods primarily focus on\nreal-time generation of head movements, but struggle to produce synchronized\nbody motions that match these head actions. Additionally, achieving\nfine-grained control over the speaking style and nuances of facial expressions\nremains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nframework for stylized real-time portrait video generation, enabling expressive\nand flexible video chat that extends from talking head to upper-body\ninteraction. Our approach consists of the following two stages. The first stage\ninvolves efficient hierarchical motion diffusion models, that take both\nexplicit and implicit motion representations into account based on audio\ninputs, which can generate a diverse range of facial expressions with stylistic\ncontrol and synchronization between head and body movements. The second stage\naims to generate portrait video featuring upper-body movements, including hand\ngestures. We inject explicit hand control signals into the generator to produce\nmore detailed hand movements, and further perform face refinement to enhance\nthe overall realism and expressiveness of the portrait video. Additionally, our\napproach supports efficient and continuous generation of upper-body portrait\nvideo in maximum 512 * 768 resolution at up to 30fps on 4090 GPU, supporting\ninteractive video-chat in real-time.

Most existing methods for crafting\nphysical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary\nmodifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to\nspecific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world\nadversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally\noccurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical\nobjects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges\norganically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual\ndeterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step\napproach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network\nis employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the\ncontext of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the\ncharacteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the\nsecond step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code,\nstrategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly\nalters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate\nadversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually\nrealistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading\nneural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign\ndatasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and\nphysical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater\nrobustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world\nadversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a\nmodel's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672cAdvWT\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7136\u78e8\u635f\u73b0\u8c61\u4ee5\u6b3a\u9a97\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4e34\u65f6\u6027\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u7136\u78e8\u635f\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528GAN\u5efa\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u78e8\u635f\uff1b2) \u5728\u78e8\u635f\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "AdvWT\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bef\u5bfcDNN\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u5916\u89c2\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u78e8\u635f\u6807\u5fd7\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AdvWT\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7136\u78e8\u635f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

It provides a\ntech-nical pathway for efficient deployment of visual image segmentation,\ndemon-strating significant application value in a wide range of downstream\ntasks and specialized fields within image segmentation.Project page:\nhttps://github.com/CheneyXuYiMin/SAM2DINO-Seg", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u548cSAM2\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SAM\u7cfb\u5217\u548cDINOv2\uff09\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acbDINOv2\u4e0eSAM2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eU-net\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still face two\nmajor challenges: (1) architectural limitations, most models rely on U-Net,\nwhich underperforms compared to the MM-DiT; and (2) the neglect of textual\ninformation, which can enhance controllability. In this work, we introduce\nDynamiCtrl, a novel framework that not only explores different pose-guided\ncontrol structures in MM-DiT, but also reemphasizes the crucial role of text in\nthis task. Specifically, we employ a Shared VAE encoder for both reference\nimages and driving pose videos, eliminating the need for an additional pose\nencoder and simplifying the overall framework. To incorporate pose features\ninto the full attention blocks, we propose Pose-adaptive Layer Norm (PadaLN),\nwhich utilizes adaptive layer normalization to encode sparse pose features. The\nencoded features are directly added to the visual input, preserving the\nspatiotemporal consistency of the backbone while effectively introducing pose\ncontrol into MM-DiT. Furthermore, within the full attention mechanism, we align\ntextual and visual features to enhance controllability. By leveraging text, we\nnot only enable fine-grained control over the generated content, but also, for\nthe first time, achieve simultaneous control over both background and motion.\nExperimental results verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating its strong identity preservation, heterogeneous\ncharacter driving, background controllability, and high-quality synthesis.

This paper introduces the concept\nof Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the\nexplicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and\nprovides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By\nemulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is\nhypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of\nLLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently\ndemonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e.,\ngeneration without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger\nprompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive\nperformance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning).\nAdditionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on\nreasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks,\nwhere SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation.

Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of SeRKD over existing methods, underscoring its efficacy in\nenhancing model performance and generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SeRKD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSeRKD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSeRKD\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SeRKD\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Typically, pruning focuses on the resulting\nefficiency gains at the cost of effectiveness. However, when looking at how\nindividual data points are affected by pruning, it turns out that a particular\nsubset of data points always bears most of the brunt (in terms of reduced\naccuracy) when pruning, but this effect goes unnoticed when reporting the mean\naccuracy of all data points. These data points are called PIEs and have been\nstudied in image processing, but not in NLP. In a study of various NLP\ndatasets, pruning methods, and levels of compression, we find that PIEs impact\ninference quality considerably, regardless of class frequency, and that BERT is\nmore prone to this than BiLSTM. We also find that PIEs contain a high amount of\ndata points that have the largest influence on how well the model generalises\nto unseen data. This means that when pruning, with seemingly moderate loss to\naccuracy across all data points, we in fact hurt tremendously those data points\nthat matter the most.

CLAIMCHECK is richly annotated by ML experts for\nweakness statements in the reviews and the paper claims that they dispute, as\nwell as fine-grained labels of the validity, objectivity, and type of the\nidentified weaknesses. We benchmark several LLMs on three claim-centric tasks\nsupported by CLAIMCHECK, requiring models to (1) associate weaknesses with the\nclaims they dispute, (2) predict fine-grained labels for weaknesses and rewrite\nthe weaknesses to enhance their specificity, and (3) verify a paper's claims\nwith grounded reasoning. Our experiments reveal that cutting-edge LLMs, while\ncapable of predicting weakness labels in (2), continue to underperform relative\nto human experts on all other tasks.", "AI": {"task": "Introduce CLAIMCHECK, an annotated dataset for benchmarking LLMs on claim-centric peer review tasks.", "motivation": "To address the challenge of generating sound and grounded reviews for scientific papers, especially in assessing claims.", "method": "Create CLAIMCHECK, a dataset annotated by ML experts with weakness statements, disputed claims, and fine-grained labels for validity, objectivity, and type of weaknesses.", "result": "LLMs perform well in predicting weakness labels but underperform humans in associating weaknesses with claims, rewriting weaknesses, and verifying claims.", "conclusion": "CLAIMCHECK provides a valuable benchmark for improving LLMs in scientific peer review tasks, though human expertise remains superior."}}

Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and\nimplementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for\ndeveloping better models.

We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill\nunlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation\ndistribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model\ndemonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering\nthe same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other\nqueries using a hypercube.

The noise dataset is created by subtracting predicted\npseudo-clean images from real noisy images at each iteration.

These\nchallenges underscore the need for robust evaluation frameworks, standardized\nbenchmarks for specialized domains, and improved techniques to address the\nunique requirements of privacy-sensitive fields such that this technology can\ndeliver on its considerable potential.", "AI": {"task": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e13\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u9886\u5148\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff08\u03b5\u22644\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e13\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This task is especially\nchallenging due to the absence of auditory information and the inherent\nambiguity when visually distinguishing phonemes that have overlapping visemes\nwhere different phonemes appear identical on the lips. Current methods\ntypically attempt to predict words or characters directly from these visual\ncues, but this approach frequently encounters high error rates due to\ncoarticulation effects and viseme ambiguity. We propose a novel two-stage,\nphoneme-centric framework for Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) that\naddresses these longstanding challenges. First, our model predicts a compact\nsequence of phonemes from visual inputs using a Video Transformer with a CTC\nhead, thereby reducing the task complexity and achieving robust speaker\ninvariance. This phoneme output then serves as the input to a fine-tuned Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), which reconstructs coherent words and sentences by\nleveraging broader linguistic context. Unlike existing methods that either\npredict words directly-often faltering on visually similar phonemes-or rely on\nlarge-scale multimodal pre-training, our approach explicitly encodes\nintermediate linguistic structure while remaining highly data efficient.

In autonomous driving, 3D semantic segmentation plays an\nimportant role for enabling safe navigation. Despite significant advances in\nthe field, the complexity of collecting and annotating 3D data is a bottleneck\nin this developments. To overcome that data annotation limitation, synthetic\nsimulated data has been used to generate annotated data on demand. There is\nstill however a domain gap between real and simulated data. More recently,\ndiffusion models have been in the spotlight, enabling close-to-real data\nsynthesis. Those generative models have been recently applied to the 3D data\ndomain for generating scene-scale data with semantic annotations. Still, those\nmethods either rely on image projection or decoupled models trained with\ndifferent resolutions in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such intermediary\nrepresentations impact the generated data quality due to errors added in those\ntransformations. In this work, we propose a novel approach able to generate 3D\nsemantic scene-scale data without relying on any projection or decoupled\ntrained multi-resolution models, achieving more realistic semantic scene data\ngeneration compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides improving 3D\nsemantic scene-scale data synthesis, we thoroughly evaluate the use of the\nsynthetic scene samples as labeled data to train a semantic segmentation\nnetwork. In our experiments, we show that using the synthetic annotated data\ngenerated by our method as training data together with the real semantic\nsegmentation labels, leads to an improvement in the semantic segmentation model\nperformance.

Through an ensemble\nmethodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we\ndemonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold\nhigher visual similarity to the Indus script (61.7%-63.5%) than to the Bronze\nAge Proto-Cuneiform (10.2%-10.9%) or Proto-Elamite (7.6%-8.7%) systems.\nAdditionally and contrarily to our current understanding of the networks of the\nIndus Valley Civilization, the Indus script unexpectedly maps closer to\nTibetan-Yi Corridor scripts, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.629, than to\nthe aforementioned contemporaneous West Asian signaries, both of which recorded\nmean cosine similarities of 0.104 and 0.080 despite their close geographic\nproximity and evident trade relations. Across various dimensionality reduction\npractices and clustering methodologies, the Indus script consistently clusters\nclosest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts. Our computational results align with\nqualitative observations of specific pictorial parallels in numeral systems,\ngender markers, and key iconographic elements; this is further supported by\narchaeological evidence of sustained contact networks along the ancient\nShu-Shendu road in tandem with the Indus Valley Civilization's decline,\nproviding a plausible transmission pathway.

Pre-trained diffusion models have been very\nsuccessfully used as image priors in zero-shot image restoration methods.\nHowever, how to best handle the degradation operator is still an open problem.\nIn real-world data, methods that rely on specific parametric assumptions about\nthe degradation model often face limitations in their applicability. To address\nthis, we introduce Invert2Restore, a zero-shot, training-free method that\noperates in both fully blind and partially blind settings -- requiring no prior\nknowledge of the degradation model or only partial knowledge of its parametric\nform without known parameters. Despite this, Invert2Restore achieves\nhigh-fidelity results and generalizes well across various types of image\ndegradation. It leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as a deterministic\nmapping between normal samples and undistorted image samples.

It outperforms the baseline system on\nbenchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and\nambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the\ncritical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.\nIndustrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80%\nwhile maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented\nresults, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot\nexamples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from\ndiverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner\nautomotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical\nworkflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test\nresult analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release\ndecisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in\nautomotive systems.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u5177GateLens\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6c7d\u8f66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53d1\u5e03\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6c7d\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "GateLens\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee3\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "GateLens\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "GateLens\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53d1\u5e03\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c7d\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these\nchallenges by jointly modeling camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using\na generic ray camera model.

We propose AlignDiff, a diffusion model conditioned on geometric\npriors, enabling the simultaneous estimation of camera distortions and scene\ngeometry. To enhance distortion prediction, we incorporate edge-aware\nattention, focusing the model on geometric features around image edges, rather\nthan semantic content. Furthermore, to enhance generalizability to real-world\ncaptures, we incorporate a large database of ray-traced lenses containing over\nthree thousand samples.

Our method includes first localising\nthe hand joints using a CNN based model and then refining them by extracting\ncontextual information. The self attention transformer then identifies the\nspecific joints along with the hand identity. This helps the model to identify\nthe hand belongingness of a particular joint which helps to detect the joint\neven in the occluded region. Further, these joints with hand identity are then\nused to estimate the pose using cross attention mechanism. Thus, by identifying\nthe joints in the occluded region, the obtained network becomes robust to\nocclusion. Hence, this network achieves state-of-the-art results when evaluated\non the InterHand2.6M, HO3D and H$_2$O3D datasets.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba13D\u624b-\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u906e\u6321\u662f3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u624b\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u53cc\u624b\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\uff0c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5173\u6ce8\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u5173\u8282\u53ca\u624b\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728InterHand2.6M\u3001HO3D\u548cH$_2$O3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Compared to state-of-the-art methods for 3D human mesh recovery, our\nmodel achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, while it\nsignificantly outperforms them in settings with extreme 3D poses and\nviewpoints. Additionally, we show that previous reconstruction methods\nfrequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural rotations. In\ncontrast, our approach leverages the biomechanically plausible degrees of\nfreedom making more realistic joint rotation estimates. We validate our\napproach across multiple human pose estimation benchmarks.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such\nas VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors\nlike per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.\nHowever, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus\non whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres\nto real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on\nthese metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just\nvisually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real \"world models\"\nthrough video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to\nensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,\nanatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of\nrealism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and\nsimulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a\nnext-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative\nmodels for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key\ndimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and\nCommonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored\nfor individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such\nas state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection\nmethods proposed for video generation.

We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot,\nthat uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic\nmanner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a \"double-forward pass\" training\nstrategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates\na bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of\nsummary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the\nlanguage instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct\nreplacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses:\nan autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct\noptimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after\nthe first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for\ndiscriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific\nadapters.

Specifically, we\ndiscuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video\ngeneration from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier\ntaxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of\nphysical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world\nsimulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and\nbenchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this\ndomain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to\nadvancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through\nstructured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide\ndirectional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically\nconsistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models\nfrom the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like\nphysical comprehension''.", "AI": {"task": "\u603b\u7ed3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u8ba8\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u4eff\u8fc8\u5411\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u3002"}}

While effective, the existing VICL paradigm exhibits poor\ngeneralizability under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose test-time\nVisual In-Context Tuning (VICT), a method that can adapt VICL models on the fly\nwith a single test sample. Specifically, we flip the role between the task\nprompts and the test sample and use a cycle consistency loss to reconstruct the\noriginal task prompt output. Our key insight is that a model should be aware of\na new test distribution if it can successfully recover the original task\nprompts.

We evaluate our model across well-established six video\nunderstanding benchmarks (e.g., MVBench, EgoSchema, NextQA, and PercepTest).\nOur results show that Mobile-VideoGPT-0.5B can generate up to 46 tokens per\nsecond while outperforming existing state-of-the-art 0.5B-parameter models by 6\npoints on average with 40% fewer parameters and more than 2x higher throughput.\nOur code and models are publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/Amshaker/Mobile-VideoGPT.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6Mobile-VideoGPT\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u591a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e27\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "Mobile-VideoGPT-0.5B\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad82\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "Mobile-VideoGPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing server-side FCL methods in nature domain construct a\ncontinually learnable server model by client aggregation on all-involved tasks.\nHowever, they are challenged by: (1) Catastrophic forgetting for previously\nlearned tasks, leading to error accumulation in server model, making it\ndifficult to sustain comprehensive knowledge across all tasks.

Moreover, to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference\nsemantic frame is introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in\ncommon video coding methods. At the receiver, multi-frame compensation (MFC) is\nproposed to produce compensated current semantic frame with a multi-frame\nfusion attention module.

A key aspect of sensing integration is\nparameter estimation, which involves extracting information about the\nsurrounding environment, such as the direction, distance, and velocity of\nvarious objects within. This is typically of a high-dimensional nature, which\nleads to significant computational complexity, if performed jointly across\nmultiple sensing dimensions, such as space, frequency, and time. Additionally,\ndue to the incorporation of sensing on top of the data transmission, the time\nwindow available for sensing is likely to be short, resulting in an estimation\nproblem where only a single snapshot is accessible. In this work, we propose\nPLAIN, a tensor-based estimation architecture that flexibly scales with\nmultiple sensing dimensions and can handle high dimensionality, limited\nmeasurement time, and super-resolution requirements. It consists of three\nstages: a compression stage, where the high dimensional input is converted into\nlower dimensionality, without sacrificing resolution; a decoupled estimation\nstage, where the parameters across the different dimensions are estimated in\nparallel with low complexity; an input-based fusion stage, where the decoupled\nparameters are fused together to form a paired multidimensional estimate. We\ninvestigate the performance of the architecture for different configurations\nand compare it against practical sequential and joint estimation baselines, as\nwell as theoretical bounds.

Despite its importance, there is no single,\nunified account of objecthood, though multiple theoretical frameworks provide\ninsights. In the first part of this paper, we present a comprehensive overview\nof the main theoretical frameworks in objecthood research - Gestalt psychology,\nenactive cognition, and developmental psychology - and identify the core\ncapabilities each framework attributes to object understanding, as well as what\nfunctional roles they play in shaping world models in biological agents. Given\nthe foundational role of objecthood in world modelling, understanding\nobjecthood is also essential in AI. In the second part of the paper, we\nevaluate how current AI paradigms approach and test objecthood capabilities\ncompared to those in cognitive science. We define an AI paradigm as a\ncombination of how objecthood is conceptualised, the methods used for studying\nobjecthood, the data utilised, and the evaluation techniques. We find that,\nwhilst benchmarks can detect that AI systems model isolated aspects of\nobjecthood, the benchmarks cannot detect when AI systems lack functional\nintegration across these capabilities, not solving the objecthood challenge\nfully.

While recent attempts have adapted\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into\ngenerators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor\nquality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at\novercoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as\nProgressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D\nground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a\nnative 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to\nprogressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each\nstep it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion\nmodels, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill\ntext-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score\ndistillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can\neasily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for\nchallenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate\nthe inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we\ntrain a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\\%$\ntrainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo\noutperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality.\nSpecifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and\ngeneralize well for challenging text input.
