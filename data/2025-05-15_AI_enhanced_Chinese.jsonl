This research investigates the use of\nauthorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a\nmeans to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting\ntransparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior\nwork, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and\nexpansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three\ndatasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of\nMelbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include\nLLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from\n506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology\nto construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture\nmeaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's\neffectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing\nbetween student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against\nLLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the\nenhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and\nmeasure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing\neducators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.\nThis work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the\ndynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4f5c\u8005\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316AI\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u91cf\u5316AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6311\u6218\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f5c\u8005\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u5b66\u751f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u8c03\u67e5\u3002"}}

Current approaches that prevent unsafe generation are\nbased on the models' own knowledge, and the majority of them require\nfine-tuning. This article explores the use of external sources for ensuring\nsafe outputs in SBMs. Our safe-for-work (SFW) sampler implements a Conditional\nTrajectory Correction step that guides the samples away from undesired regions\nin the ambient space using multimodal models as the source of conditioning.\nFurthermore, using Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), our method\nadmits user-defined NSFW classes, which can vary in different settings.

However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data\ndrift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these\nissues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state\nestimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six\nintegrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB\nsensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in\nresolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with\nanthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors\nare affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled\nUnscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor\ndata and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF\niteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain\nhuman motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over\nstate of the art in pose accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "UMotion\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u548cUWB\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7UKF\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u53163D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u59ff\u6001\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0fIMU\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUMotion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408IMU\u548cUWB\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528UKF\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u878d\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUMotion\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "UMotion\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional creativity assessments\nare often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human\nratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In\ncontrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual\nembeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We\nevaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish,\nGerman, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating\nrobust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts.

Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher\nlogits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the\ncontext prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual\nentrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the\nrelevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the\nsentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon.

This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as\nchat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g.,\nQwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat\ntemplates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing\nusers to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby\nbalancing latency and performance based on task complexity.

While recent advancements focus on designing increasingly complex\nneural network models, we observe a peculiar phenomenon: resetting certain\nparameters to random values unexpectedly improves enhancement performance for\nsome images. Drawing inspiration from biological genes, we term this phenomenon\nthe gene effect. The gene effect limits enhancement performance, as even random\nparameters can sometimes outperform learned ones, preventing models from fully\nutilizing their capacity. In this paper, we investigate the reason and propose\na solution. Based on our observations, we attribute the gene effect to static\nparameters, analogous to how fixed genetic configurations become maladaptive\nwhen environments change. Inspired by biological evolution, where adaptation to\nnew environments relies on gene mutation and recombination, we propose\nparameter dynamic evolution (PDE) to adapt to different images and mitigate the\ngene effect. PDE employs a parameter orthogonal generation technique and the\ncorresponding generated parameters to simulate gene recombination and gene\nmutation, separately.

This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning\nmethods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a\ndataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares\nvarious MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2,\nwith conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision\nTransformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such\nas ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation.\nResults: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task,\ntraditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype\nclassification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional\ndeep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged\nprecision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While\nMLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH\nsubtyping is inferior to deep networks.

Some existing anomaly detection\nmethods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external\ndata.

A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient\nexploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to\nrobust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs\npossess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous\nconclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal\nrelationships, using the well-established \"Blicket Test\" paradigm from\ndevelopmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive\ndisjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual,\nyet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones.

RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new\ncorruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables\npublic two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a\ncurated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not\nnecessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type.\nRobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a\nfirst-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience.

A pragmatic investigation was\ndeployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency\nDepartment in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or\npatients with suspected stroke (site-2).

To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated\nsegmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS.\nSpecifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and\nglobal-level class representations.

However, existing position\nencoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language\nprocessing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships\nbetween image patches.

However, deep learning models are\noften overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty.\nMoreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood\npredictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results.\nSuch challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic\nframework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for\ntrained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model\nuncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing\nconformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set\nincludes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous\nclasses. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end\nusers, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations\nrather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely\nclasses. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets\nusing expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators.

To\naddress this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN),\na novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU\nactivation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This\ninnovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce\nintricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN\nmodule for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution\noperations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and\nfidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator\nnetwork using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and\ngenerated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions\nof the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M\nparameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both\nspeech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of\nthe DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers\nsuperior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its\nrobustness and adaptability.
