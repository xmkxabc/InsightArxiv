This study presents\na comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B\nto 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP,\nMercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three\ndimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational\nefficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The\nfindings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive\nresults while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making\nthem viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However,\nachieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models.\nThese models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require\nmuch more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance\nimprovements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption,\nhighlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the\nmultilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in\nlanguages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker\nperformance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these\ndifferences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across\nprogramming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into\nthe design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03160v1", "cate": "cs.SE", "date": "2025-07-03", "updated": "2025-07-03"}

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns.

Two models are typically\nconsidered: the one-pass model, which outputs results only at the end of the\nstream, and the continual observation model, which requires releasing private\nsummaries at every time step. While the one-pass model allows more efficient\nsolutions, continual observation better reflects scenarios where timely and\nongoing insights are critical.\n  In the one-pass setting, sketches have proven to be an effective tool for\ndifferentially private frequency analysis, as they can be privatized by a\nsingle injection of calibrated noise.

To\naddress this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a\nnew post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in\ntransformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods;\nwe have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally\ndetermined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using\nthese structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid\nresidues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method\nand others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the\ndataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\ninterpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03197v1", "cate": "cs.CE", "date": "2025-07-03", "updated": "2025-07-03"}

LVM4CSI maps CSI\ntasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats\ncompatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt\nextracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI\nthrough three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human\nactivity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI\nachieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an\nimprovement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%\nreduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the\nnumber of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN\ndesign.", "comment": "This work has been submitted for possible publication", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05121v1", "cate": "cs.IT", "date": "2025-07-07", "updated": "2025-07-07"}

However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,\nsuch as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars\nsignificantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across\nplatforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state\nand high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently\nexamined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from\nmultiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped\nMid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.\nNotably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively\nincludes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state\nand spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark\nevaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor\ndata. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud\nregistration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and\nhybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar\nsystems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for\nfuture research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar\nplatforms.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04321v1", "cate": "cs.RO", "date": "2025-07-06", "updated": "2025-07-06"}

We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize\nplanning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to\nanalyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules\nthat improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft\ndiamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving\nefficiency compared to baseline LLM planners.

Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel\nPrediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,\nwhere the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of\nmultinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts\nsemantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to\nrealize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic\nExclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity\ninherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest\nimprovements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV\nsegmentation tasks, respectively.

Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos.

Inspired by recent advances in state-space models\n(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range\nmodeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial\nsince our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity\nmethods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade\nperformance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information\nduring multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To\nresolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise\nheight information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby\nenhancing camera-LiDAR alignment.

In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a\nnovel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-\nand post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth\narrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:\n(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn\nthe distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the\ngeneration of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style\ngeneration module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models\nby incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative\nand quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns\nclosely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth\nalignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.\nThe code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/lcshhh/teeth_generator.", "comment": "Accepted by ICCV 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04685v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-07", "updated": "2025-07-07"}

To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting\naccelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and\nflexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators\ncould serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively\nmodulating the synaptic weight updates.", "comment": "12 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, presented at 34th Annual Computational\n  Neuroscience Meeting", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03222v1", "cate": "q-bio.NC", "date": "2025-07-03", "updated": "2025-07-03"}
