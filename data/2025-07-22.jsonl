To\nmanage the complexity, the task is divided into four subtasks: entity detection\n(T1), entity type identification (T2), related pair detection (T3), and\nrelationship type identification (T4). We apply task-specific fine-tuning to\naccurately extract relevant entities and infer their relationships in\naccordance with the STIX specification. To address the lack of training data,\nwe compiled a comprehensive dataset with 4,011 entities and 2,075 relationships\nextracted from 141 full threat analysis reports, all annotated in alignment\nwith the STIX standard. Our models achieved F1-scores of 84.43% for T1, 88.49%\nfor T2, 95.47% for T3, and 84.60% for T4 in real-world scenarios. We validated\ntheir performance against a range of open- and closed-parameter models, as well\nas state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improvements of 2-25% across tasks.", "comment": "This paper is accepted at RAID 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16576v1", "cate": "cs.CR", "date": "2025-07-22", "updated": "2025-07-22"}

Therefore, this study focuses on the optimization of leg\nstructures for construction robots, proposing a topology optimization strategy\nbased on the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) variable\ndensity method along with a structural re-design approach. The design\nperformance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using\nANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the\nrationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the\nSIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which\naccounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative\ncalculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After\noptimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\\%, and the overall leg\nmass decreases by 7.92\\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally,\nstatic and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg.

A\nnovel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric\nsaturation function.

The reduced 6G latency coupled\nwith edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic\noffloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally\nintensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and\ninto the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery\nneeds in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with\nsmaller form factors. However, offloading introduces increased delays compared\nto local execution, primarily due to network transmission latency and queuing\ndelays at edge servers, especially under multi-user concurrency. Despite the\ncomputational power of edge platforms, the resulting motion-to-photon (MTP)\nlatency negatively impacts user experience. To mitigate this, motion prediction\nhas been proposed to offset delays. Existing approaches build on either deep\nlearning or Kalman filtering. Deep learning techniques face scalability\nlimitations at the resource-constrained edge, as their computational expense\nintensifies with increasing user concurrency, while Kalman filtering suffers\nfrom poor handling of complex movements and fragility to packet loss inherent\nin 6G's high-frequency radio interfaces. In this work, we introduce a\ncontext-aware error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) prediction framework, which\nforecasts the user's head motion trajectory to compensate for MTP latency in\nremote XR. By integrating a motion classifier that categorizes head motions\nbased on their predictability, our algorithm demonstrates reduced prediction\nerror across different motion classes.

These draw on existing\nliterature, expert interviews, and original analysis, all within the scope of\nconfidentially overseeing AI development and deployment that uses thousands of\nhigh-end AI chips. We find that states could eventually verify compliance by\nusing six largely independent verification approaches with substantial\nredundancy: (1) built-in security features in AI chips; (2-3) separate\nmonitoring devices attached to AI chips; and (4-6) personnel-based mechanisms,\nsuch as whistleblower programs. While promising, these approaches require\nguardrails to protect against abuse and power concentration, and many of these\ntechnologies have yet to be built or stress-tested. To enable states to\nconfidently verify compliance with rules on large-scale AI development and\ndeployment, the R&D challenges we list need significant progress.", "comment": "80 pages, summary included", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15916v1", "cate": "cs.CY", "date": "2025-07-21", "updated": "2025-07-21"}

Second, prior approaches tend to\nintroduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,\nleading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current\nframeworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the\nevaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search.

Our\nrepresentation is differentiable in nature, making it suitable for\ngradient-based optimization approaches for shape search. As these symmetry\nconstraints naturally arise in tiling classes, our method is ideal for\nrepresenting tile shapes belonging to any tiling class. To demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method, we design two frameworks for addressing the challenging\nproblems of Escherization and Density Estimation. The first framework is\ndedicated to the Escherization problem, where we parameterize tile shapes\nbelonging to different isohedral classes.

It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%,\nwhich is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal\nmethods.", "comment": "6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables. Accepted to ICSM 2025.

However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy.

While GNNWR extends traditional\nGeographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial\nweighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed\ndistance-based schemes and limited inductive bias.

GNNs have proven\nhighly effective in various network-based learning applications and require\nsome form of node features to function.

In social networks, node\nfeatures are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of\ninherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal\nperformance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for\nconstructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average\ncontrollability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as\nnode-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building\non this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average\ncontrollability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional\nfeature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive\nnumerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network\ndatasets to compare different node feature construction methods.

We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross\nvalidation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk.\nHowever, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as\nthe data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable\nunbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we\ndub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the\ntest point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often\nencountered in time series forecasting.
