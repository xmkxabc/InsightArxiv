While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that\nstructured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling\nrapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how\ndeep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models."}

Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs\noften undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra\nand incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of\nthe root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and\npersonalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach\nto address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\nusing knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response\ngeneration tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing\ncontinuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can\nbe used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,\ncontact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper.

In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach\nthat leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter\ncount and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the\nlarge V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K\nembedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of\nthese K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,\nwhich are then efficiently \"scattered\" to the full vocabulary space using the\nlearned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on\nstandard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits\ncan achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in\nlogit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to\nfull softmax baselines.

In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the\nbest-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and\nMBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of\ngenerated code."}

In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension.

Its versatility enables real-time\napplications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS\nfaces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as\npopping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in\ndisturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when\nrendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for\nVR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by\nlarge field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of\nhead-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine\nand extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR\nholistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal\nProjection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques\nand core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated\nrasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch,\navoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also\nincorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on\nStopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method\nthrough a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong\npreference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is\nthe first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern\nVR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and\nstereo-disrupting floaters."}
