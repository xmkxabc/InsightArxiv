We term such transitions as coordinated interactions\nand decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous\nmethods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are\ncritical for multiple characters.

The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related\n3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the\nmotion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects. As the\ndeformation and optimization are only conducted on the motion-related 3DGs,\nMGStream avoids flickering artifacts and improves the storage efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets N3DV and MeetRoom demonstrate that\nMGStream surpasses existing streaming 3DGS-based approaches in terms of\nrendering quality, training/storage efficiency and temporal consistency.

By dynamically combining\nlearnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness\nagainst spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on\nthe refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture\nfrequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence,\nwhile simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task.\nComprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and\ncross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods\nby a large margin.

Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM\nby supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is\nuseful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as\nmemory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the\nFG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same\nidentity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step\nis incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo\nquery memory, matching with query features in a compatible way.

Controlling the motion of\nsubjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes\nto describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the\nmotion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image\noften differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial\nposition, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion\nPrior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses\nthe powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to\nenable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos\nin both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first\nintroduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between\nmoving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference\nin the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed\nto allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To\navoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an\nappearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference\nsubject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed\nprompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the\neffectiveness of our method.

Across several challenging\nmathematical reasoning datasets, we find that models trained with DRP achieve\nsubstantial improvements in token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.\nSpecifically, DRP reduces average token usage on GSM8K from 917 to 328 while\nimproving accuracy from 91.7% to 94.1%, and achieves a 43% token reduction on\nAIME with no performance drop. Further analysis shows that aligning the\nreasoning structure of training CoTs with the student's reasoning capacity is\ncritical for effective knowledge transfer and performance gains."}

While recent efforts have explored\nadversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional\ndiscriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the\ndiscrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein,\nwe address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly\nderived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a\ntwo-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target\npredictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the\ntraditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a\nDeep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component.\nSubsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate\nan adversarial loss using the Fr\\'echet distance. The proposed framework is\ntherefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids\nthe expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method.

The diversity of human actions\nfurther complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion\npatterns.

Fusing\nmonocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased\nmonocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the\ngeneralization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the\nunbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the\ngeneralization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and\nobserve three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The\nfirst problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular\ndepth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular\nfeature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity\nupdate leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map\ncould alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed\nat the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we\npropose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the\ndepth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute\ndepth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight\nthe initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In\naddition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the\ndisparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression\nmodule can globally and adaptively align them.

However,\nthese goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by\nthe limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to\neffectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing\nmethods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this\nviewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this\npaper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS),\na framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance\nto novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D\ngeneration and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference\nappearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the\npersonalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided\nby geometric cues.

However,\nvisualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been\nprimarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like\nPCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within\na single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore)\nacross multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique\ndesigned to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by\nlearning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space.\nSpecifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a\npost-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized\nkernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach\nenables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex\nmetric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom\nand overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that\nAKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and\ntrustworthy visualizations.

Diffusion-based language\nmodels have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel\ngeneration capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are\noften constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to\ncombine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,\nmodeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete\ndiffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the\npreceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered\nby two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible\ncontrol mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed\ngranularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language\nmodels. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive\nframework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on\nlocal semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a\nclassifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient\npost-hoc conditioning without retraining.

We term such transitions as coordinated interactions\nand decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous\nmethods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are\ncritical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis\nusually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.\nOptimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective\nfunctions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more\ncharacters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two\nchallenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data\nand the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)\npresent new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks\nlike requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks.\nSimultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010,\nISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured\nframeworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the\nintersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards,\nhighlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while\nmaintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational\nsoftware quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software\nengineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including\nrequirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation\nmaintenance.

RADAR improves report generation by systematically\nleveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved\ninformation. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge\nthat aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves\nrelevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally,\nby aggregating both sources, RADAR generates more accurate and informative\nradiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU\nX-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both\nlanguage quality and clinical accuracy"}

In this work, we extend the\ndebate paradigm to a multimodal setting, exploring its potential for weaker\nmodels to supervise and enhance the performance of stronger models. We focus on\nvisual question answering (VQA), where two \"sighted\" expert vision-language\nmodels debate an answer, while a \"blind\" (text-only) judge adjudicates based\nsolely on the quality of the arguments. In our framework, the experts defend\nonly answers aligned with their beliefs, thereby obviating the need for\nexplicit role-playing and concentrating the debate on instances of expert\ndisagreement. Experiments on several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the\ndebate framework consistently outperforms individual expert models. Moreover,\njudgments from weaker LLMs can help instill reasoning capabilities in\nvision-language models through finetuning."}

In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of\nresponse types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on\nsubtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we\nintroduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational\nvideos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.\nThis dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic\ninteractions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal\nLLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual\ncontext to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is\nappropriate.

To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight\nalignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at\nthe start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the\nrest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while\nmaintaining reasoning performance.

In this paper, we introduce\nContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates\nextensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.\nContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory\nperceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.\nContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from\nhistorical data to predict the necessity for proactive services.

However, while this paradigm\nenhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has\nhistorically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can\ncontinuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,\nfine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In\ncontrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,\nspanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet\ntypically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This\nintroduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output\ncannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it\ndifficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In\nthis paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to\nreintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.\nNExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows\nengaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a\npersonalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted\nfeedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these\nfeedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines\ncurrent search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates\ninteraction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and\ngeneration models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative\nAI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for\nbuilding feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside\nhuman feedback."}
