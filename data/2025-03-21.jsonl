However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on\nsegmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than\ncontinuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a\ncontinuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By\nreformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding\ndiffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent\nrepresentations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our\nkey contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that\nlearns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range\ndependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture\ncombining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided\ntransformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for\nsemantic mask reconstruction.

The omission of\ncontextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to\ngenerate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases.

To address this challenge, we introduce\nAutoDrive-QA, an automatic pipeline that converts existing driving QA datasets\n(including DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, and LingoQA) into a structured multiple-choice\nquestion (MCQ) format. This benchmark systematically assesses perception,\nprediction, and planning tasks, providing a standardized and objective\nevaluation framework. AutoDrive-QA employs an automated pipeline that leverages\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality, contextually relevant\ndistractors based on domain-specific error patterns commonly found in\nautonomous driving scenarios. To evaluate both general capabilities and\ngeneralization performance, we test the benchmark on three public datasets and\nconduct zero-shot experiments on an unseen dataset. The zero-shot evaluations\nreveal that GPT-4V leads with 69.57% accuracy -- achieving 74.94% in\nPerception, 65.33% in Prediction, and 68.45% in Planning -- demonstrating that\nwhile all models excel in Perception, they struggle in Prediction.\nConsequently, AutoDrive-QA establishes a rigorous, unbiased standard for\nintegrating and evaluating different vision-language models across various\nautonomous driving datasets, thereby improving generalization in this field.

Additionally, inconsistencies in training\ndata and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it\ndifficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce\nLLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with\ndiverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified\ntraining protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis\nsystematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4,\nLLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and\ninstruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and\nperformance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based\narchitectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional\nexperiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and\nvariations in pre-training datasets.

We propose an end-to-end framework for\naffinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental\ntechnical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that\npreserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii)\nan adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space\nModel with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and\n(iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity\nthrough hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this\nstudy presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within\ncollaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for\nenhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive\nevaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates\nsubstantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Notably, on the\nNUS-WIDE dataset, our method achieves significant gains of 18.22% and 18.65% in\nimage-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks, respectively.

However,\napplying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data\nthrough vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization\nerrors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks.\nHowever, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the\nautoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the\nbenefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more\ndifficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with\nsimilar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated\nimage, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this\ninsight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by\nassigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of\ntwo stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse\nlabels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that\nsimultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their\ncoarse labels. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate our method's superior\nperformance, achieving an average improvement of 59 points in Inception Score\ncompared to baselines.

To process high-level\nintent and intuitive control in diverse scenarios, we propose a practical\ncontrollable motions synthesis framework that respects sparse and flexible\nkeyjoint signals. Our approach employs a decomposed diffusion-based motion\nsynthesis framework that first synthesizes keyjoint movements from sparse input\ncontrol signals and then synthesizes full-body motion based on the completed\nkeyjoint trajectories. The low-dimensional keyjoint movements can easily adapt\nto various control signal types, such as end-effector position for diverse\ngoal-driven motion synthesis, or incorporate functional constraints on a subset\nof keyjoints. Additionally, we introduce a time-agnostic control formulation,\neliminating the need for frame-specific timing annotations and enhancing\ncontrol flexibility. Then, the shared second stage can synthesize a natural\nwhole-body motion that precisely satisfies the task requirement from dense\nkeyjoint movements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sparse and flexible\nkeyjoint control through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets and\nscenarios."}

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful\nframework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as\nwell as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and\nvisualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model\nparameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited\nfor low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor\nregularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity\nconstraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for\nextending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated\nPnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson\nlikelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a\nRiemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the\nlikelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is\ndemonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with\nstate-of-the-art methods."}

However, existing FL\nframeworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to\nperformance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving\ntechniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen\nfairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias\ncorrection. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in\nFL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution\noptimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and\nuncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a\ngradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks\nwhile maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an\nevidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing\ncontributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This\nensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET\ndataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience,\nand robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy,\nreduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while\ndemonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other\napproaches."}

Yet, few metrics directly model human visual perception, and\nmost rely on hand-crafted formulas or training datasets to achieve alignment\nwith perceptual data. In this paper, we propose a set of tests for\nfull-reference quality metrics that examine their ability to model several\naspects of low-level human vision: contrast sensitivity, contrast masking, and\ncontrast matching. The tests are meant to provide additional scrutiny for newly\nproposed metrics. We use our tests to analyze 33 existing image and video\nquality metrics and find their strengths and weaknesses, such as the ability of\nLPIPS and MS-SSIM to predict contrast masking and poor performance of VMAF in\nthis task. We further find that the popular SSIM metric overemphasizes\ndifferences in high spatial frequencies, but its multi-scale counterpart,\nMS-SSIM, addresses this shortcoming. Such findings cannot be easily made using\nexisting evaluation protocols."}

Achieving this requires the rapid and precise alignment of 2D\nintraoperative images (e.g., X-ray) with 3D preoperative volumes (e.g., CT,\nMRI). However, current 2D/3D registration methods fail across the broad\nspectrum of procedures dependent on X-ray guidance: traditional optimization\ntechniques require custom parameter tuning for each subject, whereas neural\nnetworks trained on small datasets do not generalize to new patients or require\nlabor-intensive manual annotations, increasing clinical burden and precluding\napplication to new anatomical targets. To address these challenges, we present\nxvr, a fully automated framework for training patient-specific neural networks\nfor 2D/3D registration. xvr uses physics-based simulation to generate abundant\nhigh-quality training data from a patient's own preoperative volumetric\nimaging, thereby overcoming the inherently limited ability of supervised models\nto generalize to new patients and procedures. Furthermore, xvr requires only 5\nminutes of training per patient, making it suitable for emergency interventions\nas well as planned procedures. We perform the largest evaluation of a 2D/3D\nregistration algorithm on real X-ray data to date and find that xvr robustly\ngeneralizes across a diverse dataset comprising multiple anatomical structures,\nimaging modalities, and hospitals.
