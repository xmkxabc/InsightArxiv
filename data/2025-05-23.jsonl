The system employs a Digital Twin framework, which enables iterative\nfeedback and refinement, thereby improving the accuracy and quality of the\ncaustic patterns produced. This paper extends the foundational work in caustic\ngeneration by integrating liquid surfaces as refractive media. This concept has\npreviously been explored in simulations but not fully realised in practical\napplications. The utilisation of ultrasound to directly manipulate these\nsurfaces enables the generation of dynamic caustics with a high degree of\nflexibility. The Digital Twin approach further enhances this process by\nallowing for precise adjustments and optimisation based on real-time feedback.\nExperimental results demonstrate the technique's capacity to generate\ncontinuous animations and complex caustic patterns at high frequencies.\nAlthough there are limitations in contrast and resolution compared to\nsolid-surface methods, this approach offers advantages in terms of real-time\nadaptability and scalability. This technique has the potential to be applied in\na number of areas, including interactive displays, artistic installations and\neducational tools.

RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to\ninternalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than\nmerely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard\nSFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime,\nunlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation."}

More importantly, we contribute a comprehensive metric named PancapScore\nand a human-curated test set for reliable model evaluation.Experiments show\nthat our PancapChain-13B model can beat state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs like\nInternVL-2.5-78B and even surpass proprietary models like GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.0-Pro, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data engine and method.\nProject page: https://visual-ai.github.io/pancap/"}

To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS)\nframework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene,\nthat models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven\nmotion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this\nframework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first\nidentify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion\nregions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these\nkeypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a\nspatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian\npoints with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction\nstrategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous\nregions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall,\nComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to\n3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining\ncompetitive visual fidelity and rendering speed.

Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model\n(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with\nthis limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image\nembeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose\nto use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,\nwhich boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for\nderiving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base\nretriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two\nacceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear\napproximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5\nwhen prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when\nprompts are only available during inference."}

This paper investigates the\ncapabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating\nhigh-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models.\nWe conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points\nfrom Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three\nstrategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3)\ngenerate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different\ndatasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., \"Click\" and \"Listing\nInteractions\")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic\ndata to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings\nunderscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and\nlistings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low\nlevels of hallucination.

The primary challenge involves preserving the visual\nauthenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique\nof the subject.

Most current video virtual try-on\napproaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet\nstill overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and\ngarment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial\nalignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for\nthe temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such\nmotivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction\nDiffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic\npose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a\nskeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses\ninto the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely\ndesigned to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term\nhuman pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms.

To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a\nparadigm shift: instead of selective removal, we advocate for inducing model\ncollapse--effectively forcing the model to \"unlearn everything\"--specifically\nin response to updates characteristic of malicious adaptation. This collapse\ndirectly neutralizes the very general capabilities that attackers exploit,\ntackling the core issue unaddressed by selective unlearning. We introduce the\nCollapse Trap (CTRAP) as a practical mechanism to implement this concept\nconditionally. Embedded during alignment, CTRAP pre-configures the model's\nreaction to subsequent fine-tuning dynamics. If updates during fine-tuning\nconstitute a persistent attempt to reverse safety alignment, the pre-configured\ntrap triggers a progressive degradation of the model's core language modeling\nabilities, ultimately rendering it inert and useless for the attacker.\nCrucially, this collapse mechanism remains dormant during benign fine-tuning,\nensuring the model's utility and general capabilities are preserved for\nlegitimate users.

In\nthis work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated\nlearning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and\nReasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations,\ntask formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We\nhave extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation\nto heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable\nenvironments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in\nFL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench\nlays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated\nlearning with real-world relevance.

Selective Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training\nstrategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that\nencourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,\nleading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the\nhuman-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but\nthink carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when\nreasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training\nstrategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective\n'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with\nempty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold\nstart for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to\nfreely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome\nrewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by\nup to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even\nimproving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering\na range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently\nreveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning\nsteps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward\nhuman-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/kokolerk/TON."}

Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm.

In this paper, we observe that\nbackdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing\nabnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term\nattention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),\na data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as\nself-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates\nvia a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned\nmodel, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal\nseparation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious\nsamples.
