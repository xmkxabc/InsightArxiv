Health information leakage due to\nmalicious attacks can lead to serious problems such as misdiagnoses and patient\nidentification issues. Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies, particularly federated learning (FL), have\nemerged in recent years as innovative solutions to balance privacy protection\nwith data utility; however, they also suffer from inherent privacy\nvulnerabilities. Gradient inversion attacks constitute major threats to data\nsharing in federated learning. Researchers have proposed many defenses against\ngradient inversion attacks. However, current defense methods for healthcare\ndata lack generalizability, i.e., existing solutions may not be applicable to\ndata from a broader range of populations. In addition, most existing defense\nmethods are tested using non-healthcare data, which raises concerns about their\napplicability to real-world healthcare systems. In this study, we present a\ndefense against gradient inversion attacks in federated learning. We achieve\nthis using latent data perturbation and minimax optimization, utilizing both\ngeneral and medical image datasets.

Existing healthcare data\nsystems are often fragmented and lack a holistic representation of patient\ntrajectories, creating challenges for coordinated care and personalized\ninterventions. Patient Journey Knowledge Graphs (PJKGs) represent a novel\napproach to addressing the challenge of fragmented healthcare data by\nintegrating diverse patient information into a unified, structured\nrepresentation. This paper presents a methodology for constructing PJKGs using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to process and structure both formal clinical\ndocumentation and unstructured patient-provider conversations. These graphs\nencapsulate temporal and causal relationships among clinical encounters,\ndiagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, enabling advanced temporal reasoning and\npersonalized care insights. The research evaluates four different LLMs, such as\nClaude 3.5, Mistral, Llama 3.1, and Chatgpt4o, in their ability to generate\naccurate and computationally efficient knowledge graphs. Results demonstrate\nthat while all models achieved perfect structural compliance, they exhibited\nvariations in medical entity processing and computational efficiency.

Gemini 2.0 demonstrates\nreduced gender bias, notably with female-specific prompts achieving a\nsubstantial rise in acceptance rates compared to results obtained by\nChatGPT-4o. It adopts a more permissive stance toward sexual content and\nmaintains relatively high acceptance rates for violent prompts, including\ngender-specific cases. Despite these changes, whether they constitute an\nimprovement is debatable. While gender bias has been reduced, this reduction\ncomes at the cost of permitting more violent content toward both males and\nfemales, potentially normalizing violence rather than mitigating harm.\nMale-specific prompts still generally receive higher acceptance rates than\nfemale-specific ones. These findings underscore the complexities of aligning AI\nsystems with ethical standards, highlighting progress in reducing certain\nbiases while raising concerns about the broader implications of the model's\npermissiveness.

In order to geographically align the SV\nimage and RS image, we propose a novel implicit neural representations (INR)\nmodule that learns a continuous RS image representation and looks up the RS\nembedding at the SV image's geolocation. Next, these geographically aligned SV\nembedding, RS embedding, and location embedding are trained with contrastive\nlearning objectives from unlabeled data.

In this paper, we propose Cross-modal and Uncertainty-aware\nAgglomeration for Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding dubbed CUA-O3D, the\nfirst model to integrate multiple foundation models-such as CLIP, DINOv2, and\nStable Diffusion-into 3D scene understanding. We further introduce a\ndeterministic uncertainty estimation to adaptively distill and harmonize the\nheterogeneous 2D feature embeddings from these models. Our method addresses two\nkey challenges: (1) incorporating semantic priors from VLMs alongside the\ngeometric knowledge of spatially-aware vision foundation models, and (2) using\na novel deterministic uncertainty estimation to capture model-specific\nuncertainties across diverse semantic and geometric sensitivities, helping to\nreconcile heterogeneous representations during training.

General-purpose LLMs often\nstruggle with hallucinations, where generated responses deviate from\nauthoritative sources, raising concerns about their reliability in religious\ncontexts. This challenge highlights the need for systems that can integrate\ndomain-specific knowledge while maintaining response accuracy, relevance, and\nfaithfulness. In this study, we investigate 13 open-source LLMs categorized\ninto large (e.g., Llama3:70b, Gemma2:27b, QwQ:32b), medium (e.g., Gemma2:9b,\nLlama3:8b), and small (e.g., Llama3.2:3b, Phi3:3.8b). A Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) is used to make up for the problems that come with using\nseparate models. This research utilizes a descriptive dataset of Quranic surahs\nincluding the meanings, historical context, and qualities of the 114 surahs,\nallowing the model to gather relevant knowledge before responding. The models\nare evaluated using three key metrics set by human evaluators: context\nrelevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. The findings reveal that\nlarge models consistently outperform smaller models in capturing query\nsemantics and producing accurate, contextually grounded responses. The\nLlama3.2:3b model, even though it is considered small, does very well on\nfaithfulness (4.619) and relevance (4.857), showing the promise of smaller\narchitectures that have been well optimized.

Submitted for publication in the Encyclopedia\n  of Language & Linguistics", "summary": "This article provides a brief overview of the field of Natural Language\nGeneration. The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest\ndefinition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of\ninformation through natural language. That information could be stored in a\nlarge database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG\nresearchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning\n(image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG\nis closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT)\nand Dialog Systems.

One of the reasons for this issue is\nusers' lack of understanding in crafting effective prompts that accurately\nconvey their information needs. Meanwhile, the existence of real-world\nconversational datasets on the one hand, and the text understanding faculties\nof LLMs on the other, present a unique opportunity to study this problem, and\nits potential solutions at scale. Thus, in this paper we present the first\nLLM-centric study of real human-AI chatbot conversations, focused on\ninvestigating aspects in which user queries fall short of expressing\ninformation needs, and the potential of using LLMs to rewrite suboptimal user\nprompts. Our findings demonstrate that rephrasing ineffective prompts can\nelicit better responses from a conversational system, while preserving the\nuser's original intent. Notably, the performance of rewrites improves in longer\nconversations, where contextual inferences about user needs can be made more\naccurately. Additionally, we observe that LLMs often need to -- and inherently\ndo -- make \\emph{plausible} assumptions about a user's intentions and goals\nwhen interpreting prompts.

However, these models may inadvertently generate inappropriate\ncontent, such as copyrighted works or offensive images. While existing methods\nattempt to eliminate specific unwanted concepts, they often fail to ensure\ncomplete removal, allowing the concept to reappear in subtle forms. For\ninstance, a model may successfully avoid generating images in Van Gogh's style\nwhen explicitly prompted with 'Van Gogh', yet still reproduce his signature\nartwork when given the prompt 'Starry Night'. In this paper, we propose SAFER,\na novel and efficient approach for thoroughly removing target concepts from\ndiffusion models. At a high level, SAFER is inspired by the observed\nlow-dimensional structure of the text embedding space. The method first\nidentifies a concept-specific subspace $S_c$ associated with the target concept\nc. It then projects the prompt embeddings onto the complementary subspace of\n$S_c$, effectively erasing the concept from the generated images.

After making the fully connected layer, the embedding vector is\nprocessed by the Spatial Multi-Head Attention Transformer, which captures\nspatial dependencies between joints. In the next stage, the Temporal Multi-Head\nAttention Transformer captures long-range temporal dependencies, and again, the\nfeatures are concatenated with the output using another skip connection. The\nprocessed features are then passed to the Feed-Forward Network (FFN), which\nrefines the feature representations further. After the FFN, additional skip\nconnections are applied to combine the output with earlier layers, followed by\na final normalization layer to produce the final output feature tensor.

Existing\ntext-to-video alignment metrics like CLIPScore only generate coarse-grained\nscores without fine-grained alignment details, failing to align with human\npreference. To address this limitation, we propose ETVA, a novel Evaluation\nmethod of Text-to-Video Alignment via fine-grained question generation and\nanswering. First, a multi-agent system parses prompts into semantic scene\ngraphs to generate atomic questions. Then we design a knowledge-augmented\nmulti-stage reasoning framework for question answering, where an auxiliary LLM\nfirst retrieves relevant common-sense knowledge (e.g., physical laws), and then\nvideo LLM answers the generated questions through a multi-stage reasoning\nmechanism.

Recent studies have shown that\nhigh-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of\nGaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless,\nexisting 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of\nGaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a\nsmaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute\ncompression, leading to severe quality degradation.

The production of multi-instance 2D line\nart colorization adheres to an industry-standard workflow, which consists of\nthree crucial stages: the design of line art characters, the coloring of\nindividual objects, and the refinement process. The artists are required to\nrepeat the process of coloring each instance one by one, which is inaccurate\nand inefficient. Meanwhile, current generative methods fail to solve this task\ndue to the challenge of multi-instance pair data collection. To tackle these\nchallenges, we incorporate three technical designs to ensure precise character\ndetail transcription and achieve multi-instance sketch colorization in a single\nforward. Specifically, we first propose the self-play training strategy to\nsolve the lack of training data. Then we introduce an instance guider to feed\nthe color of the instance. To achieve accurate color matching, we present\nfine-grained color matching with edge loss to enhance visual quality. Equipped\nwith the proposed modules, MagicColor enables automatically transforming\nsketches into vividly-colored images with accurate consistency and\nmulti-instance control. Experiments on our collected datasets show that our\nmodel outperforms existing methods regarding chromatic precision. Specifically,\nour model critically automates the colorization process with zero manual\nadjustments, so novice users can produce stylistically consistent artwork by\nproviding reference instances and the original line art.

We then analyzed the\ninteraction quality, examining aspects such as utterance counts, interruption\nfrequency, and participant perceptions of the avatar.

Moreover, existing\nsemantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla\nsoftmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for\nthe pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of\nparametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque\nprocess of classification decision.

Specifically, for each\nclass, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding\npixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes\nthrough hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we\nintroduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of\npixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms.\nEspecially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide\ninterpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the\ntraining set.

EasyRobust targets at two types of robustness: 1)\nAdversarial robustness enables the model to defense against malicious inputs\ncrafted by worst-case perturbations, also known as adversarial examples; 2)\nNon-adversarial robustness enhances the model performance on natural test\nimages with corruptions or distribution shifts. Thorough benchmarks on image\nclassification enable EasyRobust to provide an accurate robustness evaluation\non vision models. We wish our EasyRobust can help for training\npractically-robust models and promote academic and industrial progress in\nclosing the gap between human and machine vision.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for leveraging\nsynthetic experiments performed exclusively by Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ninitially bypass the need for human participation in experiments involving\nonline moderation. We evaluate six LLM moderation configurations; two currently\nused real-life moderation strategies (guidelines issued for human moderators\nfor online moderation and real-life facilitation), two baseline strategies\n(guidelines elicited for LLM alignment work, and LLM moderation with minimal\nprompting) a baseline with no moderator at all, as well as our own proposed\nstrategy inspired by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation of the problem.\nWe find that our own moderation strategy significantly outperforms established\nmoderation guidelines, as well as out-of-the-box LLM moderation.

However, existing\ntoken reduction techniques, such as token pruning and token merging, often\ndisrupt essential spatial-temporal positional embeddings, failing to adequately\nbalance computational efficiency with fewer tokens. Consequently, these methods\nresult in relatively lengthy token sequences, limiting their applicability in\nscenarios requiring extreme token compression, such as video large language\nmodels. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of extreme short token\nreduction, aiming to represent extensive video sequences with a minimal number\nof tokens. To address this challenge, we propose Token Dynamics, a new video\nrepresentation framework that dynamically reduces token count while preserving\nspatial-temporal coherence. Specifically, we disentangle video representations\nby separating visual embeddings from grid-level motion information, structuring\nthem into: 1. a concise token base, created by clustering tokens that describe\nobject-level content; 2. a token dynamics map, capturing detailed\nspatial-temporal motion patterns across grids. Furthermore, we introduce a\ncross-dynamics attention mechanism that integrates motion features into the\ntoken base without increasing token length, thereby maintaining compactness and\nspatial-temporal integrity. The experiments demonstrate a reduction of token\ncount to merely 0.07% of the original tokens, with only a minor performance\ndrop of 1.13%. Additionally, we propose two novel subtasks within extreme token\nreduction (fixed-length and adaptive-length compression), both effectively\nrepresenting long token sequences for video-language tasks.

We benchmark current models and\nfound that exhibiting empathetic actions remains a significant challenge.\nMeanwhile, we train Llama3-8B using EmpathyAgent and find it can potentially\nenhance empathetic behavior. By establishing a standard benchmark for\nevaluating empathetic actions, we hope to advance research in empathetic\nembodied agents.

Existing methods do this by\ndescribing objects at a single level of detail, which often does not capture\nfine-grained details such as varying textures, materials, and shapes of the\nparts of objects. We propose the task of expressive 3D captioning: given an\ninput 3D scene, describe objects at multiple levels of detail: a high-level\nobject description, and a low-level description of the properties of its parts.\nTo produce such captions, we present ExCap3D, an expressive 3D captioning model\nwhich takes as input a 3D scan, and for each detected object in the scan,\ngenerates a fine-grained collective description of the parts of the object,\nalong with an object-level description conditioned on the part-level\ndescription. We design ExCap3D to encourage semantic consistency between the\ngenerated text descriptions, as well as textual similarity in the latent space,\nto further increase the quality of the generated captions. To enable this task,\nwe generated the ExCap3D Dataset by leveraging a visual-language model (VLM)\nfor multi-view captioning. The ExCap3D Dataset contains captions on the\nScanNet++ dataset with varying levels of detail, comprising 190k text\ndescriptions of 34k 3D objects in 947 indoor scenes.

However, due to the unique optical properties, the\ndepth information on these objects is usually incomplete and inaccurate, which\nposes significant challenges for downstream robotics tasks. Therefore, it is\ncrucial to accurately restore the depth information of transparent and specular\nobjects. Previous depth completion methods for these objects usually use RGB\ninformation as an additional channel of the depth image to perform depth\nprediction. Due to the poor-texture characteristics of transparent and specular\nobjects, these methods that rely heavily on color information tend to generate\nstructure-less depth predictions.

The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference\nimage according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image,\nespecially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named\nPrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference\nimages in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a\nworld view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain\nvisual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the\nmanipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs.

To meet\nmodeling requirements, autoregressive models possessing the characteristics of\nscalability and flexibility embrace a discrete-valued tokenizer, but face the\nchallenge of poor image generation quality. In contrast, diffusion models take\nadvantage of the continuous-valued tokenizer to achieve better generation\nquality but are subject to low efficiency and complexity.

As 3D object\ndetection systems (OD) can interpret such point cloud data, they play a key\nrole in the driving decisions of autonomous vehicles. Consequently, such 3D OD\nmust be robust against all types of perturbations and must therefore be\nextensively tested. One approach is the use of adversarial examples, which are\nsmall, sometimes sophisticated perturbations in the input data that change,\ni.e., falsify, the prediction of the OD. These perturbations are carefully\ndesigned based on the weaknesses of the OD. The robustness of the OD cannot be\nquantified with adversarial examples in general, because if the OD is\nvulnerable to a given attack, it is unclear whether this is due to the\nrobustness of the OD or whether the attack algorithm produces particularly\nstrong adversarial examples. The contribution of this work is Hi-ALPS --\nHierarchical Adversarial-example-based LiDAR Perturbation Level System, where\nhigher robustness of the OD is required to withstand the perturbations as the\nperturbation levels increase.

To further address the limitation that the\nproposed bi-directional attention module may not well capture global subtle\nforgery information in the artifact feature (e.g., textures or edges), we\nemploy a fine-grained frequency attention module in the frequency domain. By\ndoing so, we can obtain high-frequency information in the fine-grained\nfeatures, which contains the global and subtle forgery information. Although\nthese features from the diverse domains can be effectively and independently\nimproved, fusing them directly does not effectively improve the detection\nperformance. Therefore, we propose a feature superposition strategy that\ncomplements information from spatial and frequency domains. This strategy turns\nthe feature components into the form of wave-like tokens, which are updated\nbased on their phase, such that the distinctions between authentic and artifact\nfeatures can be amplified. Our method demonstrates significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on five public Deepfake datasets in\ncapturing abnormalities across different manipulated operations and real-life.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9891\u7387\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbDeepfake\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dDeepfake\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u4f2a\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9891\u7387\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u53e0\u52a0\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00Deepfake\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Deepfake\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our approach effectively aligns patch images with tissue types, and\nwe fine-tune our model via prompt learning using only a few labeled WSIs per\ncategory. Experimentation on real-world pathological WSI datasets and ablation\nstudies highlight our method's superior performance over existing MIL- and\nVLM-based methods in few-shot WSI classification tasks.

Thus, the interaction\nbetween spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance\nmore challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that\nadapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a\nsimple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal\ndimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background\nappearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal\nvariations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we\nintroduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature\nspace to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench,\na general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a\nhybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion\nsimilarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than\nprevious works.

We explore a\nbottom-up part-wise procedure undertaken by an RL agent to segment and\nreconstruct these 2D multipart objects. The environment's state is represented\nas a four-colour image, where different colours correspond to background, a\ntarget edge, a reconstruction line, and the overlap of both. At each step, the\nagent can transform the reconstruction line within a four-dimensional action\nspace or terminate the episode using a specific termination action. To\ninvestigate the impact of reward function formulations, we tested episodic and\nincremental rewards, as well as combined approaches. Empirical results\ndemonstrated that the latter yielded the most effective training performance.\nTo further enhance efficiency and stability, we introduce curriculum learning\nstrategies. First, an action-based curriculum was implemented, where the agent\nwas initially restricted to a reduced action space, being able to only perform\nthree of the five possible actions, before progressing to the full action\nspace. Second, we test a task-based curriculum, where the agent first solves a\nsimplified version of the problem before being presented with the full, more\ncomplex task. This second approach produced promising results, as the agent not\nonly successfully transitioned from learning the simplified task to mastering\nthe full task, but in doing so gained significant performance. This study\ndemonstrates the potential of an iterative RL wire-frame reconstruction in two\ndimensions. By combining optimized reward function formulations with curriculum\nlearning strategies, we achieved significant improvements in training success.\nThe proposed methodology provides an effective framework for solving similar\ntasks and represents a promising direction for future research in the field.", "AI": {"task": "\u4ece\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u610f3D\u7ebf\u6846\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u5206\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u548c\u91cd\u5efa2D\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u7ef4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u91cd\u5efa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u53ca\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Diffusion\nmodels have shown promise in LCPET denoising for recovering degraded image\nquality. However, training such models requires large and diverse datasets,\nwhich are challenging to obtain in the medical domain. To address data scarcity\nand privacy concerns, we combine diffusion models with federated learning -- a\ndecentralized training approach where models are trained individually at\ndifferent sites, and their parameters are aggregated on a central server over\nmultiple iterations. The variation in scanner types and image noise levels\nwithin and across institutions poses additional challenges for federated\nlearning in LCPET denoising. In this study, we propose a novel noise-embedded\nfederated learning diffusion model (Fed-NDIF) to address these challenges,\nleveraging a multicenter dataset and varying count levels. Our approach\nincorporates liver normalized standard deviation (NSTD) noise embedding into a\n2.5D diffusion model and utilizes the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to\naggregate locally trained models into a global model, which is subsequently\nfine-tuned on local datasets to optimize performance and obtain personalized\nmodels.

A\nsignificant challenge in video-to-speech synthesis lies in the substantial\nmodality gap between silent video and multi-faceted speech. In this paper, we\npropose a novel video-to-speech system that effectively bridges this modality\ngap, significantly enhancing the quality of synthesized speech. This is\nachieved by learning of hierarchical representations from video to speech.\nSpecifically, we gradually transform silent video into acoustic feature spaces\nthrough three sequential stages -- content, timbre, and prosody modeling.

This research explores\npartial denoising techniques to provide practical solutions for improved\nfracture analysis, ultimately enhancing patient care. The study explores deep\nlearning model DenseNet and handcrafted feature extraction. Decision Tree and\nRandom Forest, were employed to train and evaluate distinct image\nrepresentations.

However, the computationally intensive\nsampling steps associated with diffusion models hinder their practicality in\nreal-world applications. Hence, we present DIDiffGes, for a Decoupled\nSemi-Implicit Diffusion model-based framework, that can synthesize\nhigh-quality, expressive gestures from speech using only a few sampling steps.\nOur approach leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enable\nlarge-step sampling for diffusion model. We decouple gesture data into body and\nhands distributions and further decompose them into marginal and conditional\ndistributions. GANs model the marginal distribution implicitly, while L2\nreconstruction loss learns the conditional distributions exciplictly. This\nstrategy enhances GAN training stability and ensures expressiveness of\ngenerated full-body gestures. Our framework also learns to denoise root noise\nconditioned on local body representation, guaranteeing stability and realism.\nDIDiffGes can generate gestures from speech with just 10 sampling steps,\nwithout compromising quality and expressiveness, reducing the number of\nsampling steps by a factor of 100 compared to existing methods.

Recently, well-designed\nattack, which restores the unauthorized-domain performance by fine-tuning NTL\nmodels on few authorized samples, highlights the security risks of NTL-based\napplications. However, such attack requires modifying model weights, thus being\ninvalid in the black-box scenario. This raises a critical question: can we\ntrust the security of NTL models deployed as black-box systems? In this work,\nwe reveal the first loophole of black-box NTL models by proposing a novel\nattack method (dubbed as JailNTL) to jailbreak the non-transferable barrier\nthrough test-time data disguising. The main idea of JailNTL is to disguise\nunauthorized data so it can be identified as authorized by the NTL model,\nthereby bypassing the non-transferable barrier without modifying the NTL model\nweights. Specifically, JailNTL encourages unauthorized-domain disguising in two\nlevels, including: (i) data-intrinsic disguising (DID) for eliminating domain\ndiscrepancy and preserving class-related content at the input-level, and (ii)\nmodel-guided disguising (MGD) for mitigating output-level statistics difference\nof the NTL model. Empirically, when attacking state-of-the-art (SOTA) NTL\nmodels in the black-box scenario, JailNTL achieves an accuracy increase of up\nto 55.7% in the unauthorized domain by using only 1% authorized samples,\nlargely exceeding existing SOTA white-box attacks.", "AI": {"task": "\u63ed\u793a\u9ed1\u76d2\u975e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NTL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aJailNTL\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u751f\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u76d2NTL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u4f2a\u88c5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f2a\u88c5\uff09\u7ed5\u8fc7NTL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5c4f\u969c\u3002", "result": "JailNTL\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281%\u6388\u6743\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u672a\u6388\u6743\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe55.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "JailNTL\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2NTL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However,\ngenerating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing\nmethods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In\nthis paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating\nmechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance\ngeneration, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic\nsensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to\nprecisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on\nthe intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we\npropose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic\nfeatures, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We\nalso introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately\nmodel upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby\nimproving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive\nexperiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity.
