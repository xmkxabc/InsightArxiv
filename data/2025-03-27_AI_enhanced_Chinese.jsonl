This challenge also\napplies to domain- or language-specific models, where fine-tuning on\nspecialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this\npaper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions.\nSpecifically, we derive the diff vector from one source model version, which\nrepresents the weight changes from fine-tuning, and apply it to the base model\nof a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various\nopen-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can\nsignificantly improve the target base model, often achieving performance\ncomparable to its fine-tuned counterpart. For example, reusing the fine-tuning\nupdates from Llama 3.0 8B leads to an absolute accuracy improvement of 10.7% on\nGPQA over the base Llama 3.1 8B without additional training, surpassing Llama\n3.1 8B Instruct. In a multilingual model development setting, we show that this\napproach can significantly increase performance on target-language tasks\nwithout retraining, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.7% and 15.5% on\nGlobal MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively, compared to Llama 3.1 8B\nInstruct. Our controlled experiments reveal that fine-tuning transfer is most\neffective when the source and target models are linearly connected in the\nparameter space. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning transfer offers\na stronger and more computationally efficient starting point for further\nfine-tuning. Finally, we propose an iterative recycling-then-finetuning\napproach for continuous model development, which improves both efficiency and\neffectiveness.

With the transition from mere tools to\nhuman-like assistants, understanding their psychological aspects-such as\nemotional tendencies and personalities-becomes essential for ensuring their\ntrustworthiness. However, current psychological evaluations of LLMs, often\nbased on human psychological assessments like the BFI, face significant\nlimitations. The results from these approaches often lack reliability and have\nlimited validity when predicting LLM behavior in real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel evaluation instrument specifically designed for\nLLMs, called Core Sentiment Inventory (CSI). CSI is a bilingual tool, covering\nboth English and Chinese, that implicitly evaluates models' sentiment\ntendencies, providing an insightful psychological portrait of LLM across three\ndimensions: optimism, pessimism, and neutrality. Through extensive experiments,\nwe demonstrate that: 1) CSI effectively captures nuanced emotional patterns,\nrevealing significant variation in LLMs across languages and contexts; 2)\nCompared to current approaches, CSI significantly improves reliability,\nyielding more consistent results; and 3) The correlation between CSI scores and\nthe sentiment of LLM's real-world outputs exceeds 0.85, demonstrating its\nstrong validity in predicting LLM behavior.

With advancements in vision-language\npretrained (VLP) models, recent two-class FAS techniques have leveraged the\nadvantages of using VLP guidance, while this potential remains unexplored in\none-class FAS methods. The one-class FAS focuses on learning intrinsic liveness\nfeatures solely from live training images to differentiate between live and\nspoof faces. However, the lack of spoof training data can lead one-class FAS\nmodels to inadvertently incorporate domain information irrelevant to the\nlive/spoof distinction (e.g., facial content), causing performance degradation\nwhen tested with a new application domain. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel framework called Spoof-aware one-class face anti-spoofing with Language\nImage Pretraining (SLIP). Given that live faces should ideally not be obscured\nby any spoof-attack-related objects (e.g., paper, or masks) and are assumed to\nyield zero spoof cue maps, we first propose an effective language-guided spoof\ncue map estimation to enhance one-class FAS models by simulating whether the\nunderlying faces are covered by attack-related objects and generating\ncorresponding nonzero spoof cue maps.

Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training\nconditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to\nuse a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise\nprediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe\nthat the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in\ntraining results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly,\nthese poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for\ndegrading the quality of conditional generation.

These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly\ndetailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs\nduring inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes\nprompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods\noften rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context\nlearning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent,\nomit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize\nprompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can\nlead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a\nprincipled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles:\nharmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully\npreserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of\ngenerated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization\napproach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset\nbased on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both\ntext-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with\npreference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO\nsignificantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to\nbaseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video\ngeneration models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be\ncombined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the\neffectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

Main Track", "summary": "Adversarial attacks in black-box settings are highly practical, with\ntransfer-based attacks being the most effective at generating adversarial\nexamples (AEs) that transfer from surrogate models to unseen target models.\nHowever, their performance significantly degrades when transferring across\nheterogeneous architectures -- such as CNNs, MLPs, and Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) -- due to fundamental architectural differences. To address this, we\npropose Feature Permutation Attack (FPA), a zero-FLOP, parameter-free method\nthat enhances adversarial transferability across diverse architectures. FPA\nintroduces a novel feature permutation (FP) operation, which rearranges pixel\nvalues in selected feature maps to simulate long-range dependencies,\neffectively making CNNs behave more like ViTs and MLPs. This enhances feature\ndiversity and improves transferability both across heterogeneous architectures\nand within homogeneous CNNs.

Our approach allows\ndirect analysis of 3D object movements from video, tackling the uncertainty\nthat typically occurs when translating real-world motion into recorded footage.\nThe project page is accessible via: https://jaeah.me/liv3stroke_web}", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLiv3Stroke\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u53d8\u5f623D\u7b14\u89e6\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u76843D\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u53c2\u6570\u53163D\u66f2\u7ebf\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d63D\u70b9\u4e91\u8fd0\u52a8\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u66f2\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f62\u4ee5\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u76843D\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Liv3Stroke\u901a\u8fc73D\u7b14\u89e6\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue,\nrecent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational\ncosts of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient\nprojectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in\ndifficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic\npyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as\na hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with\nincreasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio,\nfine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To\nmaximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling\nExperts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate\naccording to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned\nlarger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten\nbenchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs\non LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the\ngeneralization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution\nMLLM called LLaVA-HR.

The IVTON task involves seamlessly\nsuperimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a\nrealistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike\nconventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large\npre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable\ntransformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme,\nachieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key\ncomponent of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA),\na dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image\nencoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep\nand garment image complexity.

At the beginning a\nbrief overview of the revious work in this project is provided. Afterwards the\nfocus shifts to a crucial problem in the fruit farming domain: the difficulty\nof making reliable yield predictions early in the season. Following three Satin\nsweet cherry trees along the year 2023 enabled the collection of accurate\nground truth data about the development of cherries from dormancy until\nharvest. The methodology used to collect this data is presented, along with its\nvaluation and visualization. The predictive power of counting objects at all\nrelevant vegetative stages of the fruit development cycle in cherry trees with\nregards to yield predictions is investigated. It is found that all investigated\nfruit states are suitable for yield predictions based on linear regression.\nConceptionally, there is a trade-off between earliness and external events with\nthe potential to invalidate the prediction. Considering this, two optimal\ntimepoints are suggested that are opening cluster stage before the start of the\nflowering and the early fruit stage right after the second fruit drop. However,\nboth timepoints are challenging to solve with automated procedures based on\nimage data. Counting developing cherries based on images is exceptionally\ndifficult due to the small fruit size and their tendency to be occluded by\nleaves.

This research area presents a complex\nchallenge in computer vision because of the rapid and intricate movements\ninherent in sign languages, which encompass hand gestures, body postures, and\neven facial expressions. Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has\nattracted increasing attention due to its ability to handle variations in\nsubjects and backgrounds independently. However, current skeleton-based SLR\nmethods exhibit three limitations: 1) they often neglect the importance of\nrealistic hand poses, where most studies train SLR models on non-realistic\nskeletal representations; 2) they tend to assume complete data availability in\nboth training or inference phases, and capture intricate relationships among\ndifferent body parts collectively; 3) these methods treat all sign glosses\nuniformly, failing to account for differences in complexity levels regarding\nskeletal representations.

Detecting these hallucinations\nis essential for establishing trust in MLLMs among clinicians and patients,\nthereby enabling their real-world adoption. Current hallucination detection\nmethods, especially semantic entropy (SE), have demonstrated promising\nhallucination detection capacity for LLMs. However, adapting SE to medical\nMLLMs by incorporating visual perturbations presents a dilemma.

To address this issue, we propose Vision\nAmplified Semantic Entropy (VASE), which incorporates weak image\ntransformations and amplifies the impact of visual input, to improve\nhallucination detection in medical VQA. We first estimate the semantic\npredictive distribution under weak visual transformations to preserve clinical\nvalidity, and then amplify visual influence by contrasting this distribution\nwith that derived from a distorted image.

To\naddress these problems, we propose a novel Truncated Diffusion model for\nefficient Blind Face Restoration (TD-BFR), a three-stage paradigm tailored for\nthe progressive resolution of degraded images. Specifically, TD-BFR utilizes an\ninnovative truncated sampling method, starting from low-quality (LQ) images at\nlow resolution to enhance sampling speed, and then introduces an adaptive\ndegradation removal module to handle unknown degradations and connect the\ngeneration processes across different resolutions.

However, they have limitations in precisely defining visual redundancy\ndue to their inability to capture the influence of visual tokens on MLLMs'\nvisual understanding (i.e., the predicted probabilities for textual token\ncandidates).

Without access to\npreviously learned tasks and unseen tasks, memory-constrained MCIL suffers from\nforward and backward forgetting. To alleviate the above challenges,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT), such as prompt tuning, are\nemployed to adapt the PT-VLM to the diverse incrementally learned tasks. To\nachieve effective new task adaptation, existing methods only consider the\neffect of PEFT strategy selection, but neglect the influence of PEFT parameter\nsetting (e.g., prompting). In this paper, we tackle the challenge of optimizing\nprompt designs for diverse tasks in MCIL and propose an Instance-Aware\nPrompting (IAP) framework. Specifically, our Instance-Aware Gated Prompting\n(IA-GP) module enhances adaptation to new tasks while mitigating forgetting by\ndynamically assigning prompts across transformer layers at the instance level.\nOur Instance-Aware Class-Distribution-Driven Prompting (IA-CDDP) improves the\ntask adaptation process by determining an accurate task-label-related\nconfidence score for each instance.

However, most\nexisting methods focus primarily on generating static 3D models, overlooking\nthe potentially dynamic nature of certain shapes, such as humanoids, animals,\nand insects. To address this gap, we focus on rigging, a fundamental task in\nanimation that establishes skeletal structures and skinning for 3D models. In\nthis paper, we introduce OmniRig, the first large-scale rigging dataset,\ncomprising 79,499 meshes with detailed skeleton and skinning information.\nUnlike traditional benchmarks that rely on predefined standard poses (e.g.,\nA-pose, T-pose), our dataset embraces diverse shape categories, styles, and\nposes. Leveraging this rich dataset, we propose ARMO, a novel rigging framework\nthat utilizes an autoregressive model to predict both joint positions and\nconnectivity relationships in a unified manner. By treating the skeletal\nstructure as a complete graph and discretizing it into tokens, we encode the\njoints using an auto-encoder to obtain a latent embedding and an autoregressive\nmodel to predict the tokens. A mesh-conditioned latent diffusion model is used\nto predict the latent embedding for conditional skeleton generation.

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of\narticle-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating\nhigh-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user\nprovided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The\nfundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and\nthe scarcity of high-quality business content data.\n  In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of\nsub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to\nultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business\ncontent is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i)\nthe construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e.,\nInfographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by\nimplementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme;\nand (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of\nregion-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the\nultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference\nusing a layout conditional CFG.\n  We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA\nsystems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set.

Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule\nsegmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis.\nUnlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can\nstreamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS\nmethods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of\nthem depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation\nalgorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D\nboxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to\nerase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with\nthe erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key\ncontributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a\nsuperpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment,\ncapturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction\nof three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score\nreward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing\nprocess precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation.

As a\nfirst step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible\nprobability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen,\nurinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an\nautomated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net\narchitecture that localizes and delineates these anatomical structures on\nWB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using \"soft-labels\" (non-binary\nsegmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach.\nFor training and validation, we employed a multi-center WB-DWI dataset\ncomprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or\nMultiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our\nweakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice\nscore/precision/recall of 0.66/0.6/0.73 for skeletal delineations,\n0.8/0.79/0.81 for internal organs, and 0.85/0.79/0.94 for spinal canal, with\nsurface distances consistently below 3 mm.

Recently,\ndeep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance and widespread\napplication. However, change detection faces data scarcity due to the\nlabor-intensive process of accurately aligning remote sensing images of the\nsame area, which limits the performance of deep learning algorithms. To address\nthe data scarcity issue, we develop a fine-tuning strategy called the Semantic\nChange Network (SCN). We initially pre-train the model on single-temporal\nsupervised tasks to acquire prior knowledge of instance feature extraction. The\nmodel then employs a shared-weight Siamese architecture and extended Temporal\nFusion Module (TFM) to preserve this prior knowledge and is fine-tuned on\nchange detection tasks. The learned semantics for identifying all instances is\nchanged to focus on identifying only the changes. Meanwhile, we observe that\nthe locations of changes between the two images are spatially identical, a\nconcept we refer to as spatial consistency. We introduce this inductive bias\nthrough an attention map that is generated by large-kernel convolutions and\napplied to the features from both time points. This enhances the modeling of\nmulti-scale changes and helps capture underlying relationships in change\ndetection semantics. We develop a binary change detection model utilizing these\ntwo strategies.

We believe that BASKET could be a useful resource for developing new\nvideo models with advanced long-range, fine-grained recognition capabilities.\nIn addition, we hope that our dataset will be useful for domain-specific\napplications such as fair basketball scouting, personalized player development,\nand many others.

In this work, we extend network\ninversion techniques to generate Confidently Classified Counterfeits-synthetic\nsamples that are confidently classified by the model despite being\nsignificantly different from the training data. We achieve this by modifying\nthe generator's conditioning mechanism from soft vector conditioning to one-hot\nvector conditioning and applying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the\none-hot vectors and the classifier's output distribution.

To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs,\nboth audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To\nsynchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio\nand video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position\nembedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently\ngenerate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two\nmodalities, we propose \\textbf{Thinker-Talker} architecture. In this framework,\nThinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while\nTalker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden\nrepresentations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the\nThinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an\nend-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we\nintroduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to\nreduce the initial package delay.

Integration of\nnetwork pruning into an adversarial training framework has been proposed to\npromote adversarial robustness. It has been observed that a highly pruned\nweight matrix tends to be ill-conditioned, i.e., increasing the condition\nnumber of the weight matrix. This phenomenon aggravates the vulnerability of a\nDNN to input noise. Although a highly pruned weight matrix is considered to be\nable to lower the upper bound of the local Lipschitz constant to tolerate large\ndistortion, the ill-conditionedness of such a weight matrix results in a\nnon-robust DNN model. To overcome this challenge, this work develops novel\njoint constraints to adjust the weight distribution of networks, namely, the\nTransformed Sparse Constraint joint with Condition Number Constraint (TSCNC),\nwhich copes with smoothing distribution and differentiable constraint functions\nto reduce condition number and thus avoid the ill-conditionedness of weight\nmatrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analyses unveil the relevance between\nthe condition number and the local Lipschitz constant of the weight matrix,\nnamely, the sharply increasing condition number becomes the dominant factor\nthat restricts the robustness of over-sparsified models.

They are handy for\ntasks in the image domain, where the quality of the explanations benefits from\nrecent advances in generative models. Although counterfactual explanations have\nbeen widely applied to classification models, their application to regression\ntasks remains underexplored. We present two methods to create counterfactual\nexplanations for image regression tasks using diffusion-based generative models\nto address challenges in sparsity and quality: 1) one based on a Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model that operates directly in pixel-space and 2)\nanother based on a Diffusion Autoencoder operating in latent space. Both\nproduce realistic, semantic, and smooth counterfactuals on CelebA-HQ and a\nsynthetic data set, providing easily interpretable insights into the\ndecision-making process of the regression model and reveal spurious\ncorrelations.

Random perturbation introduces\nsmall changes or noise to modified instances of the original data, leading to\ninconsistent explanations. Even slight variations in the generated samples\nsignificantly affect the explanations provided by such models, undermining\ntrust and hindering the adoption of interpretable models. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MindfulLIME, a novel algorithm that intelligently\ngenerates purposive samples using a graph-based pruning algorithm and\nuncertainty sampling. MindfulLIME substantially improves the consistency of\nvisual explanations compared to random sampling approaches. Our experimental\nevaluation, conducted on a widely recognized chest X-ray dataset, confirms\nMindfulLIME's stability with a 100% success rate in delivering reliable\nexplanations under identical conditions. Additionally, MindfulLIME improves the\nlocalization precision of visual explanations by reducing the distance between\nthe generated explanations and the actual local annotations compared to LIME.\nWe also performed comprehensive experiments considering various segmentation\nalgorithms and sample numbers, focusing on stability, quality, and efficiency.\nThe results demonstrate the outstanding performance of MindfulLIME across\ndifferent segmentation settings, generating fewer high-quality samples within a\nreasonable processing time. By addressing the stability limitations of LIME in\nimage data, MindfulLIME enhances the trustworthiness and interpretability of\nmachine learning models in specific medical imaging applications, a critical\ndomain.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMindfulLIME\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LIME\u5728\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u53f8\u6cd5\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LIME\uff09\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "method": "MindfulLIME\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMindfulLIME\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a100%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MindfulLIME\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3LIME\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}
