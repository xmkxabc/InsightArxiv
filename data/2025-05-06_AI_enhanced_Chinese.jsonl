However, current customization methods face\nseveral limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone;\n2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or\nconfusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent\nbackgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a\ntuning-free method that enables high-quality image customization using both\ntext and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key\noperations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel\ndiffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows\nMCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while\nmaintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to\nmitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual\nscenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise\nsubject and editable image layers based on user instructions.

This paper presents a machine learning approach for\napproximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse\nellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate\nsurface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points\nconstructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately\nwith as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e.,\nrepresent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and\napproximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is\nintroduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly\noptimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve\ncomputational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,\nrestricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.\nThe computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which\nsignificantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical\noctree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the\ninitialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using\ncoarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice\npoints are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and\nenhance training efficiency.

The challenges of PDA exist due to not only domain shift but also the\nnon-identical label spaces of domains. In this paper, a Soft-masked Semi-dual\nOptimal Transport (SSOT) method is proposed to deal with the PDA problem.\nSpecifically, the class weights of domains are estimated, and then a reweighed\nsource domain is constructed, which is favorable in conducting\nclass-conditional distribution matching with the target domain. A soft-masked\ntransport distance matrix is constructed by category predictions, which will\nenhance the class-oriented representation ability of optimal transport in the\nshared feature space. To deal with large-scale optimal transport problems, the\nsemi-dual formulation of the entropy-regularized Kantorovich problem is\nemployed since it can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms. Further, a\nneural network is exploited to approximate the Kantorovich potential due to its\nstrong fitting ability. This network parametrization also allows the\ngeneralization of the dual variable outside the supports of the input\ndistribution.

While previous efforts have focused on\ndemographic fairness, the fairness of individual biological face components\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we focus on face component fairness, a\nfairness notion defined by biological face features. To our best knowledge, our\nwork is the first work to mitigate bias of face attribute prediction at the\nbiological feature level. In this work, we identify two key challenges in\noptimizing face component fairness: attribute label scarcity and attribute\ninter-dependencies, both of which limit the effectiveness of bias mitigation\nfrom previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{B}ayesian\n\\textbf{N}etwork-informed \\textbf{M}eta \\textbf{R}eweighting (BNMR), which\nincorporates a Bayesian Network calibrator to guide an adaptive\nmeta-learning-based sample reweighting process. During the training process of\nour approach, the Bayesian Network calibrator dynamically tracks model bias and\nencodes prior probabilities for face component attributes to overcome the above\nchallenges. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on a large-scale real-world human face dataset. Our results show\nthat BNMR is able to consistently outperform recent face bias mitigation\nbaselines. Moreover, our results suggest a positive impact of face component\nfairness on the commonly considered demographic fairness (e.g.,\n\\textit{gender}).

To facilitate training and evaluation, we developed the\nMediInstruct-CXR dataset, containing structured image representations paired\nwith diverse, clinically relevant instruction-response examples, and the\nCXR-ClinEval benchmark for comprehensive assessment across various\ninterpretation tasks. Extensive experiments on CXR-ClinEval demonstrate that\nCXR-TextInter achieves state-of-the-art quantitative performance across\npathology detection, report generation, and visual question answering,\nsurpassing existing multimodal foundation models. Ablation studies confirm the\ncritical contribution of the knowledge integration module. Furthermore, blinded\nhuman evaluation by board-certified radiologists shows a significant preference\nfor the clinical quality of outputs generated by CXR-TextInter. Our work\nvalidates an alternative paradigm for medical image AI, showcasing the\npotential of harnessing advanced LLM capabilities when visual information is\neffectively structured and domain knowledge is integrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "CXR-TextInter\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\uff08CXR\uff09\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728CXR\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCXR-TextInter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06CXR\u5185\u5bb9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728CXR-ClinEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCXR-TextInter\u5728\u75c5\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "CXR-TextInter\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cfAI\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Experiments on four 3D point cloud datasets\ndemonstrate that NPISeg3D achieves superior segmentation performance with fewer\nclicks while providing reliable uncertainty estimations.", "AI": {"tldr": "NPISeg3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6982\u7387\u539f\u578b\u8c03\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u51fb\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f3D\u5206\u5272\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7528\u6237\u70b9\u51fb\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "NPISeg3D\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u6982\u7387\u539f\u578b\u8c03\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a3D\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNPISeg3D\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u70b9\u51fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "NPISeg3D\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To further refine camera pose\nestimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss,\nimproving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on\nautonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot\nsignificantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both\ndiffusion-based and auto-regressive world models.

Since\nthese attributes are inherently noisy under multiple frames, test-time global\noptimizations are often employed to fully recover the geometry, which is liable\nto failure and incurs heavy inference costs.

However, existing large\nvision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution\ndata well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB\nimages. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution\ndata, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation\nefforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda,\ndesigned to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited\nlabeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating\ninformative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively\nfine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we\npropose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture\nbehavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate\nhigh-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second,\nwe propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and\ntemporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels.

While the existing methods enable synthesizing\ngestures cooperated by individual self-talking, they overlook the practicality\nof concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations.\nMoreover, the lack of high-quality datasets with concurrent co-speech gestures\nalso limits handling this issue. To fulfill this goal, we first construct a\nlarge-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M\nframes for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed GES-Inter.\nAdditionally, we propose Co$^3$Gesture, a novel framework that enables coherent\nconcurrent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive\nmovements. Considering the asymmetric body dynamics of two speakers, our\nframework is built upon two cooperative generation branches conditioned on\nseparated speaker audio. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of human\npostures with respect to corresponding speaker audios while interacting with\nthe conversational partner, we present a Temporal Interaction Module (TIM). TIM\ncan effectively model the temporal association representation between two\nspeakers' gesture sequences as interaction guidance and fuse it into the\nconcurrent gesture generation.

Therefore, this research explores a multi-modal text-to-image\napproach for generating synthetic crop disease images and is the first to\nprovide computational benchmarking in this context. We trained three Stable\nDiffusion (SD) variants-SDXL, SD3.5M (medium), and SD3.5L (large)-and\nfine-tuned them using Dreambooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning\ntechniques to enhance generalization. SD3.5M outperformed the others, with an\naverage memory usage of 18 GB, power consumption of 180 W, and total energy use\nof 1.02 kWh/500 images (0.002 kWh per image) during inference task. Our results\ndemonstrate SD3.5M's ability to generate 500 synthetic images from just 36\nin-field samples in 1.5 hours.

We prompt the\nmodels to assume country-specific personas and use different languages for hate\nspeech detection. Our findings reveal that context personalisation\nsignificantly influences LLMs' responses in this sensitive area. To mitigate\nthese unwanted biases, we fine-tune the LLMs by penalising inconsistent hate\nspeech classifications made with and without country or language-specific\ncontext.

When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse\nweather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently,\ndeep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation.\nCurrent state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of\ndegradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed\nthat perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse\nweather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for\nmultiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture\ncalled CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block,\na novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an\nattentive fusion block with low-light correction.

To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should\nstimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a\nscore or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores\nor directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle\nto integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.\nInspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on\nreasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating\nreasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's\ninterpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of\ngenerative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which\nformulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented\ntraining pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists\nof two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by\nself-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating\ncandidate responses against them.

However, SAM is\ntrained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal\n(RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for\nscene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low\nlight and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes\nthe powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash\nthe potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T\ndata pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original\nSAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong\ngeneralization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we\nintroduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address\ncross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge\nDistillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while\nmaintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the\nminimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating\nthe combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we\nenhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM\nand incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates\nmulti-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted\nacross three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900,\nand FMB.

Although achieving reasonable\nscalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored, i.e.,\nlearnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency.\nIn this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash\nExperts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified\nframework. It is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition\nand heterogeneous NeRFs efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end\nmanner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decomposes scenes and\nallocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is\nco-optimized with the experts, by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of\nExperts (MoE) NeRF framework. We incorporate a hash-based gating network and\ndistinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns\nthe decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash\nexperts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges, enabling\neffective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different scene\nparts. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly\nscalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve\nboth quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on\nexisting large-scale NeRF datasets and a new dataset with very large-scale\nscenes ($>6.5km^2$) from UrbanBIS.

Our approach approximates noise covariance using the DL\nnetwork's Jacobian, which is intractable to calculate. To circumvent this, we\nderive an unbiased estimator for the diagonal of this covariance matrix\n(voxel-wise variance) and introduce a Jacobian sketching technique to\nefficiently implement it. We evaluate our method on knee and brain MRI datasets\nfor both data- and physics-driven networks trained in supervised and\nunsupervised manners. Compared to empirical references obtained via Monte Carlo\nsimulations, our technique achieves near-equivalent performance while reducing\ncomputational and memory demands by an order of magnitude or more. Furthermore,\nour method is robust across varying input noise levels, acceleration factors,\nand diverse undersampling schemes, highlighting its broad applicability.

It has\nunderpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement\nlearning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc\ncorrection. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive\nlearning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows\nLLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities.

Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance\nand supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired\ndata. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have\nachieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits -\ncreativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical\napplications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact,\nthe imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical\nutility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel\n2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and\nregression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore,\nwe propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws\ninspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise\nand, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality.\nThrough extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising\nmulti-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and\nregression sampling yield similar results in practice.

PDF parsing\napproaches range from inexpensive heuristics (for simple documents) to\ncomputationally intensive ML-driven systems (for complex or degraded ones).

To address these issues, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Parallel PDF Parsing and Resource Scaling Engine\n(AdaParse), a data-driven strategy for assigning an appropriate parser to each\ndocument. We enlist scientists to select preferred parser outputs and\nincorporate this information through direct preference optimization (DPO) into\nAdaParse, thereby aligning its selection process with human judgment. AdaParse\nthen incorporates hardware requirements and predicted accuracy of each parser\nto orchestrate computational resources efficiently for large-scale parsing\ncampaigns.

This\nis often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use\ncases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more\nabout subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of\nbuilding high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing\nmulti-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data,\nensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by\nexploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level\ndata requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that\nappearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve\nthis, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting\nframework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage\nregularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting\nand rendering artifacts.

We uncovered unique phenomena regarding how LLMs apply attention to\ngraph-structured data and analyzed these findings to improve the modeling of\nsuch data by LLMs. The primary findings of our research are: 1) While LLMs can\nrecognize graph data and capture text-node interactions, they struggle to model\ninter-node relationships within graph structures due to inherent architectural\nconstraints. 2) The attention distribution of LLMs across graph nodes does not\nalign with ideal structural patterns, indicating a failure to adapt to graph\ntopology nuances. 3) Neither fully connected attention nor fixed connectivity\nis optimal; each has specific limitations in its application scenarios.\nInstead, intermediate-state attention windows improve LLM training performance\nand seamlessly transition to fully connected windows during inference.

The bias term, injected prior to the\nsoftmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence\nof query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts\npost-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final\noutput. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust\nboth its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u50cf\u7d20\u4e3a\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534a\u7a20\u5bc6\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u6216\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5e73\u7b49\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u53d7\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u50cf\u7d20\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u7f6e\u9879\u548c\u5339\u914d\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u7a20\u5bc6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian\nSplatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive\nrasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering,\nimproving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance.\nRecent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS\nwithin a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian\nparameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge\nof generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to\nperform successfully at both tasks.

While prior approaches such as iterative\nreward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they\ntypically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to\naccount for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work\nidentifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic\ngradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a\nprompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize\nstochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The\nmethod dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt\nacceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting\ngradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the\nproposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees\nunder suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that\nGVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over\nvanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be\nincorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO,\nleading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance.\n  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,\n\\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and\nmulti-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system\nself-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs\nwith intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic\ntraining data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,\nwhich are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and\nunsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information\nsufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG\nsystem has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval\ndecisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context\nreinforcement learning.\n  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an\neffective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is\nsystem-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIM-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIM-RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff08Critic\uff09\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSIM-RAG\u5728\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "SIM-RAG\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent efforts attempt to improve editing\nmodels through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on\nrecognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to\nresolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by\nconstructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This\nincludes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the\noriginal-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to\nfurther enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models\nexhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,\nindependent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified\nguide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some\nchallenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified\ninstructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals\nwith positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model\ntraining using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision\neffectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training\ntasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to\nprovide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and\neffective solution for instruction-based image editing.

A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is\ndesigned, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression\nor heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we\nincorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a\nrelationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further\nstrengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets. The results\nindicate that our method is significantly superior to previous state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods and remarkably boosts the recognition ability of fingerprint\nrecognition algorithms.

Existing methods often adopt self-training with\nclustering-generated pseudo-labels but implicitly assume these labels are\nalways correct. In practice, however, this assumption fails due to inevitable\npseudo-label noise, which hinders model learning. To address this, we introduce\na new learning paradigm that explicitly considers Pseudo-Label Noise (PLN),\ncharacterized by three key challenges: noise overfitting, error accumulation,\nand noisy cluster correspondence. To this end, we propose a novel Robust\nDuality Learning framework (RoDE) for UVI-ReID to mitigate the effects of noisy\npseudo-labels. First, to combat noise overfitting, a Robust Adaptive Learning\nmechanism (RAL) is proposed to dynamically emphasize clean samples while\ndown-weighting noisy ones. Second, to alleviate error accumulation-where the\nmodel reinforces its own mistakes-RoDE employs dual distinct models that are\nalternately trained using pseudo-labels from each other, encouraging diversity\nand preventing collapse. However, this dual-model strategy introduces\nmisalignment between clusters across models and modalities, creating noisy\ncluster correspondence. To resolve this, we introduce Cluster Consistency\nMatching (CCM), which aligns clusters across models and modalities by measuring\ncross-cluster similarity.

Monocular\ndepth estimation can be divided into two main directions: (1) relative depth\nestimation, which provides normalized or inverse depth without scale\ninformation, and (2) metric depth estimation, which involves recovering depth\nwith absolute scale. To obtain absolute scale information for practical\ndownstream tasks, utilizing textual information to recover the scale of a\nrelative depth map is a highly promising approach. However, since a single\nimage can have multiple descriptions from different perspectives or with\nvarying styles, it has been shown that different textual descriptions can\nsignificantly affect the scale recovery process. To address this issue, our\nmethod, VGLD, stabilizes the influence of textual information by incorporating\nhigh-level semantic information from the corresponding image alongside the\ntextual description. This approach resolves textual ambiguities and robustly\noutputs a set of linear transformation parameters (scalars) that can be\nglobally applied to the relative depth map, ultimately generating depth\npredictions with metric-scale accuracy. We validate our method across several\npopular relative depth models(MiDas, DepthAnything), using both indoor scenes\n(NYUv2) and outdoor scenes (KITTI).

Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) using supervised learning strategies, have shown considerable\nsuccess for such tasks. However, CNN based architectures such as U-Net, often\nstruggles to accurately identify platelets due to their sizes and high\nvariability of features. To address these challenges, researchers have commonly\nemployed strategies such as class weighted loss functions, which have\ndemonstrated some success. However, this does not address the more significant\nchallenge of platelet variability in size and tendency to form aggregates and\nassociations with other blood components. In this study, we explored an\nalternative approach by investigating the role of convolutional kernels in\nmitigating these issues. We also assigned separate classes to singular\nplatelets and platelet aggregates and performed semantic segmentation using\nvarious U-Net architectures for identifying platelets. We then evaluated and\ncompared two common methods (pixel area method and connected component\nanalysis) for counting platelets and proposed an alternative approach\nspecialized for single platelets and platelet aggregates.

However, the\ngrowing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises\nserious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset\nownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks\ninto the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks\nremain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when\ntriggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness\nagainst copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we\nexplore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models\nto circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose\nthe first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to\nundermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three\nstages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient\nwatermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models\nexhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,\nevident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can\nreliably detect the watermarked samples.

Yet, due to hardware\nlimitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images\noften suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have\nwitnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing\nworks usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics\nof fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover\ncomprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the\ntarget of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical\nimage-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale\ntarget-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus\nimage enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE)\nthat employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural\ninformation and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving\nhierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real\nfundus image restoration.

Virtual simulations allow the generation of\narbitrary scenes under controlled conditions but lack physical sensor\ncharacteristics, such as intensity responses or material-dependent effects. In\ncontrast, real-world data offers true sensor realism but provides less control\nover influencing factors, hindering sufficient validation. Existing approaches\naddress this problem with augmentation of real-world point cloud data by\ntransferring objects between scenes. However, these methods do not consider\nvalidation and remain limited in controllability because they rely on empirical\ndata. We solve these limitations by proposing Point Cloud Recombination, which\nsystematically augments captured point cloud scenes by integrating point clouds\nacquired from physical target objects measured in controlled laboratory\nenvironments. Thus enabling the creation of vast amounts and varieties of\nrepeatable, physically accurate test scenes with respect to phenomena-aware\nocclusions with registered 3D meshes.
