A smart Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation in\nsmart contract that uses funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier\ninvestors. Traditional Ponzi scheme detection methods based on deep learning\ntypically rely on fully supervised models, which require large amounts of\nlabeled data. However, such data is often scarce, hindering effective model\ntraining. To address this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive learning\nframework, CASPER (Contrastive Approach for Smart Ponzi detectER with more\nnegative samples), designed to enhance smart Ponzi scheme detection in\nblockchain transactions. By leveraging contrastive learning techniques, CASPER\ncan learn more effective representations of smart contract source code using\nunlabeled datasets, significantly reducing both operational costs and system\ncomplexity. We evaluate CASPER on the XBlock dataset, where it outperforms the\nbaseline by 2.3% in F1 score when trained with 100% labeled data. More\nimpressively, with only 25% labeled data, CASPER achieves an F1 score nearly\n20% higher than the baseline under identical experimental conditions.

In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset\nfor evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used.\nTab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different\nencoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation\nof state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across\nmultiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization\nbehavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables.\nOur findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across\nencoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when\nfine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with\nAUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases.

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution.

Our key insight is to decouple\ninteraction from these constraints by introducing proxies-abstract\nrepresentations of real-world objects. We embody this concept in Reality Proxy,\na system that seamlessly shifts interaction targets from physical objects to\ntheir proxies during selection. Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality\nProxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical\nspatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel\nand previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming,\nattribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object\nselections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate\nReality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office\ninformation retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control.\nAn expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting\nthat proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction\nparadigm for future MR systems.", "comment": "16 pages, 9 figures.

Our first contribution is to\nprove the inter-reducibility of two variants of opacity: full opacity (for\nwhich the observations should be the same regardless of the visit of a private\nlocation) and weak opacity (for which it suffices that the attacker cannot\ndeduce whether the private location was visited, but for which it is harmless\nto deduce that it was not visited); we also prove further results including a\nconnection with timed language inclusion. Our second contribution is to study\nopacity for several subclasses of TAs: with restrictions on the number of\nclocks, the number of actions, the nature of time, or a new subclass called\nobservable event-recording automata. We show that opacity is mostly decidable\nin these cases, except for one-action TAs and for one-clock TAs with\n$\\epsilon$-transitions, for which undecidability remains.

Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the\ncumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any\neffective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nContinuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and\nRe-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive\ntransitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more\npotent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular\nand monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed\nselection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an\nefficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of\nevolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our\nmodel and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and\nenhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse\ndatasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline\nmethods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal\nnetworks", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20936v2", "cate": "cs.SI", "date": "2024-12-30", "updated": "2025-07-22"}

Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on\nlabor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep\nlearning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address\nthese challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach\nenhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building\nboundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and\nembedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a\nscalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from\na single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban\nplanning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis.

This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and\ntemperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across\ndifferent corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in\nautomating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can\nadapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires\nmuch more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we\npropose a \\textbf{Goal-conditioned RL framework} that enables efficient policy\ntraining for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong\ngeneralization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce\nPareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum\nby sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This\nstrategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience\nReplay, which assigns relabeled goals with conservative virtual rewards to\nstabilize training and accelerate convergence. To reduce simulation overhead,\nour framework incorporates a Skip-on-Fail simulation strategy, which skips\nfull-corner simulations when nominal-corner simulation fails to meet target\nspecifications.

Due to\nits low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the\nmainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from\nsignificant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies\nthe negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a\ncritical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect\ntraining. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware\ntime minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the\ncompression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and\ntraining task.

We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the\nvulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -\nwhether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.\nThrough empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm\nour theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities\npersist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the\nemergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a\nfundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and\nsuggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17725v1", "cate": "cs.LG", "date": "2025-07-23", "updated": "2025-07-23"}

A thorough analysis of the results leads\nto critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)\nOverall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection\nperformance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and\ncomputational complexity analysis.

But evaluating the accuracy of neural\nposterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from\nmajor limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.\nBuilding on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a\nconformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores\n-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample\np-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:\n(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that\ndegrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot\nis that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and\nreliable tests.

Existing approaches to MIPS either rely solely on Inner Product\n(IP) similarity, which faces issues with local optima and redundant\ncomputations, or reduce the MIPS problem to the Nearest Neighbor Search under\nthe Euclidean metric via space projection, leading to topology destruction and\ninformation loss. Despite the divergence of the two paradigms, we argue that\nthere is no inherent binary opposition between IP and Euclidean metrics. By\nstitching IP and Euclidean in the design of indexing and search algorithms, we\ncan significantly enhance MIPS performance. Specifically, this paper explores\nthe theoretical and empirical connections between these two metrics from the\nMIPS perspective. Our investigation, grounded in graph-based search, reveals\nthat different indexing and search strategies offer distinct advantages for\nMIPS, depending on the underlying data topology. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce a novel graph-based index called Metric-Amphibious Graph (MAG) and a\ncorresponding search algorithm, Adaptive Navigation with Metric Switch (ANMS).\nTo facilitate parameter tuning for optimal performance, we identify three\nstatistical indicators that capture essential data topology properties and\ncorrelate strongly with parameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 12\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that MAG outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 4x search speedup while maintaining adaptability and\nscalability.", "comment": "Accepted by SIGIR 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14861v2", "cate": "cs.DB", "date": "2025-04-21", "updated": "2025-07-23"}

Privacy-preserving ML\n(PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in\nwhich an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a\nformal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the\noblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly\ninvolves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning\nparity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on\ngeneral-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML\nframeworks.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to\nsignificantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We\nobserve that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly\nSPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation\nthroughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular\nmemory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing\n(NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve\neffective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman\nachieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP\nconfigurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation.

Yet there are few such datasets\navailable, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and\nimportantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we\nprovide the first release of a large developmental egocentric video\ndataset--the BabyView dataset--recorded using a high-resolution camera with a\nlarge vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 868 hour\ndataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months to 3 years\nof age in longitudinal, at-home contexts. We provide gold-standard annotations\nfor the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose\nestimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train\nself-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to\nout-of-distribution tasks, including syntactic structure learning, object\nrecognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in\neach domain scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower\nthan when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual\ndomain.

Our experiments demonstrate that FBPs provide informative\ntrajectories describing the evolving states of clients and their contributions\nto the global model, thereby enabling the identification of clusters of clients\nwith similar behaviours. Leveraging the patterns identified by FBPs, we propose\na robust aggregation technique named Federated Behavioural Shields to detect\nmalicious or noisy client models, thereby enhancing security and surpassing the\nefficacy of existing state-of-the-art FL defense mechanisms.

However, few\nuniversities provide access to both integrated domain science/CSE\ncross-training and Top-500 High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.\nNational laboratories offer internship opportunities capable of developing\nthese skills. Purpose: This student presents an evaluation of federally-funded\npostgraduate internship outcomes at a national laboratory. This study seeks to\nanswer three questions: 1) What computational skills, research skills, and\nprofessional skills do students improve through internships at the selected\nnational laboratory. 2) Do students gain knowledge in domain science topics\nthrough their internships. 3) Do students' career interests change after these\ninternships? Design/Method: We developed a survey and collected responses from\npast participants of five federally-funded internship programs and compare\nparticipant ratings of their prior experience to their internship experience.\nFindings: Our results indicate that participants improve CSE skills and domain\nscience knowledge, and are more interested in working at national labs.\nParticipants go on to degree programs and positions in relevant domain science\ntopics after their internships. Conclusions: We show that national laboratory\ninternships are an opportunity for students to build CSE skills that may not be\navailable at all institutions. We also show a growth in domain science skills\nduring their internships through direct exposure to research topics.

The multiscale\ndepthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract\nmultiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance\nnormalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a\ntemporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with\nhigher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault\ndiagnosis. The proposed model is applied to Tennessee Eastman process dataset\nand three-phase flow facility dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance and maintains a small\nmodel size.

Seasonal snow\nestimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based\nreanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis\nproducts are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and\ntemporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse.\nTo address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite\nof physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and\namount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able\nto estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various\nphysical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors.\nSpecifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate\ntasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on\na specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE\non a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using\nphysical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows\nin the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a\nclassification accuracy of $\\geq 93\\%$ for the presence of snow and a\ncoefficient of correlation of $\\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We\nwill also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and\ntemporally to previously unseen data.", "comment": "Preprint of journal paper in preparation.

In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach\ntailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:\npoetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.\nOur proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that\nis lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage\nprompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of\npoetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent\nself-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then\ncollectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research\nin the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting\nof 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources.

We address\nthis through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.\nFirst, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,\nconsisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across\nthe U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene\nprovides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic\nsegmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain\ndiversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored\nframework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent\ndiffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)\nDual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D\nGaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the\ncostly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving\ncritical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models\ntrained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model\nlatent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely\nlarge-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,\nfrom semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain\nsynthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data\npriors from Aerial-Earth3D.
