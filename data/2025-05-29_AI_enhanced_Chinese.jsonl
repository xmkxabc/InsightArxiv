To address this, we propose a hardware-algorithm\nco-design framework incorporating two innovations: (1) a CIM-Aware\nArchitecture, CIM-NET, optimized for large receptive field operation and CIM's\ncrossbar-based MVM acceleration; and (2) a pseudo-convolutional operator,\nCIM-CONV, used within CIM-NET to integrate slide-based processing with fully\nconnected transformations for high-quality feature extraction and\nreconstruction. This framework significantly reduces the number of MVM\noperations, improving inference speed on CIM chips while maintaining\ncompetitive performance.

Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly\nenhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs'\nreasoning paths.

However, UniDB's\nreliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally\nexpensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or\ndiffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal\nmean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present\nUniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon\nthese limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact\nclosed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the\nerror accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality\ngeneration with up to 20$\\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further\ncomplemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data\nprediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains\nperceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration\nmethods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as\nspecial cases under some theoretical conditions.

To address challenges in layer ambiguity,\ngeneralization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first\nlarge-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer\ndecomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare\nremoval, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition).\nBuilding on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion\nTransformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer\ndecompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending\ntype. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs\nIn-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers\nwithout per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning\nto maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers.

These results demonstrate that DCLIP\neffectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and\ngeneralization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and\ndetail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks.

By combining prompting steps, for extraction and\nrewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently\nimprove source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs.\nFinally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent\ninto the DPP kernel, we can generate personalized summaries that cover relevant\nsource information while retaining coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6b65\u5185\u5bb9\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u91cd\u5199\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6e90\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u201c\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6e90\u6750\u6599\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a1) \u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528DPP\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff1b3) \u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u6458\u8981\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728DiverseSumm\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e90\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6458\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6b65\u5185\u5bb9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ed3\u5408DPP\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

These\ntasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce\nthe computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV)\ncache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has\nbecome a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in\ninfilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the\nprompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the\ninsertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is\nfrequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally\ngenerated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format\nof FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse.

Since the instruction-tuning\ndataset might contain redundant or low-quality data, data selection (DS) is\nusually required to maximize the data efficiency. Despite the successes in the\ngeneral domain, current DS methods often struggle to select the desired data\nfor domain-specific instruction-tuning. One of the main reasons is that they\nneglect the impact of knowledge conflicts, i.e., the discrepancy between LLMs'\npretrained knowledge and context knowledge of instruction data, which could\ndamage LLMs' prior abilities and lead to hallucination. To this end, we propose\na simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Data Selection (namely KDS) framework to\nselect the domain-specific instruction-tuning data that meets LLMs' actual\nneeds. The core of KDS is to leverage two knowledge-aware metrics for\nquantitatively measuring knowledge conflicts from two aspects: context-memory\nknowledge alignment and intra-memory knowledge consistency. By filtering the\ndata with large knowledge conflicts and sampling the high-quality and diverse\ndata, KDS can effectively stimulate the LLMs' abilities and achieve better\ndomain-specific performance. Taking the medical domain as the testbed, we\nconduct extensive experiments and empirically prove that KDS surpasses the\nother baselines and brings significant and consistent performance gains among\nall LLMs. More encouragingly, KDS effectively improves the model generalization\nand alleviates the hallucination problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aKDS\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "KDS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cKDS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "KDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Disentangling Orientation Understanding in MLLMs with Fine-grained Multi-axis Perception Tasks", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Object orientation understanding represents a fundamental challenge in visual\nperception critical for applications like robotic manipulation and augmented\nreality. Current vision-language benchmarks fail to isolate this capability,\noften conflating it with positional relationships and general scene\nunderstanding. We introduce DORI (Discriminative Orientation Reasoning\nIntelligence), a comprehensive benchmark establishing object orientation\nperception as a primary evaluation target. DORI assesses four dimensions of\norientation comprehension: frontal alignment, rotational transformations,\nrelative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding.\nThrough carefully curated tasks from 11 datasets spanning 67 object categories\nacross synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how\nmulti-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the\nbest models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular\norientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring\nreference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the\nneed for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show\nsystematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation\nchanges across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting\nlimitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first\ndiagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in\nmultimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D\nscene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments.

Traditional text-based methods cannot\nhandle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG\napproaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to\nreason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental\ncapabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model\nreasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex\nreasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact\nwith search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning\ntrajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual\noptimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of\nRL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely\nincorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token\nallocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models\ninteract with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant\ninformation due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space\ntailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling,\nallowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the\nretriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query\nrewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward.

In this\nwork, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across\nMulti-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks.

Further, we\nperform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and\nmulti-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples.

In this work, we explore how generative models\ncan further be used not only to synthesize visual content but also to\nunderstand the properties of a scene given a natural image. We formulate scene\nunderstanding as an inverse generative modeling problem, where we seek to find\nconditional parameters of a visual generative model to best fit a given natural\nimage. To enable this procedure to infer scene structure from images\nsubstantially different than those seen during training, we further propose to\nbuild this visual generative model compositionally from smaller models over\npieces of a scene. We illustrate how this procedure enables us to infer the set\nof objects in a scene, enabling robust generalization to new test scenes with\nan increased number of objects of new shapes. We further illustrate how this\nenables us to infer global scene factors, likewise enabling robust\ngeneralization to new scenes.

In particular, RePa-ViT-Large and\nRePa-ViT-Huge enjoy 66.8% and 68.7% speed-ups with +1.7% and +1.1% higher top-1\naccuracies under the same training strategy, respectively. RePaViT is the first\nto employ structural reparameterization on FFN layers to expedite ViTs to our\nbest knowledge, and we believe that it represents an auspicious direction for\nefficient ViTs.

We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and\nopen-source MLLMs. The results reveal that while existing MLLMs perform\nadequately on basic perception tasks, they continue to face challenges in more\ncomplex rule detection stages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MultiStAR\u57fa\u51c6\u548cMSEval\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff08AVR\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eRAVEN\u8bbe\u8ba1MultiStAR\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MSEval\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u572817\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027MLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiStAR\u548cMSEval\u586b\u8865\u4e86AVR\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these limitations,\nwe introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework\nthat automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive\ncamera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor\nvideos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility.\nThis approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory\nannotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to\ngenerate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce\nAnchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor\nvideo guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of\nbackbone model parameters.

However,\nmost existing prototype-based FSMIS methods generate multiple prototypes from\nthe support image solely by random sampling or local averaging, which can cause\nparticularly severe boundary blurring due to the tendency for normal features\naccounting for the majority of features of a specific category. Consequently,\nwe propose to focus more attention to those weaker features that are crucial\nfor clear segmentation boundary. Specifically, we design a Support\nSelf-Prediction (SSP) module to identify such weak features by comparing true\nsupport mask with one predicted by global support prototype. Then, a Hard\nPrototypes Generation (HPG) module is employed to generate multiple hard\nprototypes based on these weak features.

However, handling complex instructions with multiple constraints\nremains challenging. Previous methods typically select preference pairs based\non the number of constraints they satisfy, introducing noise where chosen\nexamples may fail to follow some constraints and rejected examples may excel in\ncertain respects over the chosen ones. To address the challenge of aligning\nwith multiple preferences, we propose a simple yet effective method called\nReverse Preference Optimization (RPO). It mitigates noise in preference pairs\nby dynamically reversing the constraints within the instruction to ensure the\nchosen response is perfect, alleviating the burden of extensive sampling and\nfiltering to collect perfect responses. Besides, reversal also enlarges the gap\nbetween chosen and rejected responses, thereby clarifying the optimization\ndirection and making it more robust to noise.

Speculative decoding mitigates the memory\nbandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass,\nwhich increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization\nby compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces\ncomputations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their\nstrengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques.\nSurprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method\nEAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit\nweight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative\ndecoding.

This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn\nto reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In\nthis work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such\nabstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We\npresent a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in\nsentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next\nsentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical\nrepresentation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to\npreserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via\nnext-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both\nunder two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted\nembedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely\nin embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics,\nlogic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous\ninference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while\nreducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half.

Despite\nits excellent localization and counting performance, training a point-based\ncounter still faces challenges concerning annotation labor: hundreds to\nthousands of points are required to annotate a single sample capturing a dense\ncrowd. In this paper, we integrate point-based methods into a semi-supervised\ncounting framework based on pseudo-labeling, enabling the training of a counter\nwith only a few annotated samples supplemented by a large volume of\npseudo-labeled data. However, during implementation, the training encounters\nissues as the confidence for pseudo-labels fails to be propagated to background\npixels via the P2P. To tackle this challenge, we devise a point-specific\nactivation map (PSAM) to visually interpret the phenomena occurring during the\nill-posed training. Observations from the PSAM suggest that the feature map is\nexcessively activated by the loss for unlabeled data, causing the decoder to\nmisinterpret these over-activations as pedestrians. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose a point-to-region (P2R) scheme to substitute P2P, which segments out\nlocal regions rather than detects a point corresponding to a pedestrian for\nsupervision. Consequently, pixels in the local region can share the same\nconfidence with the corresponding pseudo points.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce A2Seek (Aerial Anomaly Seek), a large-scale, reasoning-centric\nbenchmark dataset for aerial anomaly understanding. This dataset covers various\nscenarios and environmental conditions, providing high-resolution real-world\naerial videos with detailed annotations, including anomaly categories,\nframe-level timestamps, region-level bounding boxes, and natural language\nexplanations for causal reasoning.

Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to\nconsider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is\nfar from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to\ntheir unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g.,\n2000$\\times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first\ngenerative model to tackle document \\textbf{D}ewarping \\textbf{v}ia a\n\\textbf{D}iffusion framework. To be specific, DvD introduces a coordinate-level\ndenoising instead of typical pixel-level denoising, generating a mapping for\ndeformation rectification. In addition, we further propose a time-variant\ncondition refinement mechanism to enhance the preservation of document\nstructures. In experiments, we find that current document dewarping benchmarks\ncan not evaluate dewarping models comprehensively. To this end, we present\nAnyPhotoDoc6300, a rigorously designed large-scale document dewarping benchmark\ncomprising 6,300 real image pairs across three distinct domains, enabling\nfine-grained evaluation of dewarping models. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed DvD can achieve state-of-the-art performance with\nacceptable computational efficiency on multiple metrics across various\nbenchmarks including DocUNet, DIR300, and AnyPhotoDoc6300.

Text2Grad is realized through three\ncomponents: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs\ncritiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts\nspan-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a\nspan-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients.\nAcross summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad\nconsistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing\nboth higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate\nthat natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful\nsignal for fine-grained policy optimization.

Direct time-of-flight (dToF) imaging offers\nhigh-precision, long-distance depth sensing, yet demands ultra-short pulse\nlight sources and high-resolution time-to-digital converters. In contrast,\nindirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging often suffers from phase wrapping and\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the sensing distance increases. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel ToF imaging paradigm, termed Burst-Encodable\nTime-of-Flight (BE-ToF), which facilitates high-fidelity, long-distance depth\nimaging. Specifically, the BE-ToF system emits light pulses in burst mode and\nestimates the phase delay of the reflected signal over the entire burst period,\nthereby effectively avoiding the phase wrapping inherent to conventional iToF\nsystems. Moreover, to address the low SNR caused by light attenuation over\nincreasing distances, we propose an end-to-end learnable framework that jointly\noptimizes the coding functions and the depth reconstruction network.

Pangu Embedded addresses the significant\ncomputational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing\nreasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its\nconstruction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation\nprocess, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate\ncomplementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend\nclusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale\nsynchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided\nby a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic,\ntask-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM\nevaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2\nintroduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a \"fast\" mode\nfor routine queries and a deeper \"slow\" mode for complex inference.

The experiment results demonstrate that models\ntrained with the UAVPairs dataset and the ranked list loss achieve\nsignificantly improved retrieval accuracy compared to models trained on\nexisting datasets or with conventional losses. Furthermore, these improvements\ntranslate to enhanced view graph connectivity and higher quality of\nreconstructed 3D models. The models trained by the proposed approach perform\nmore robustly compared with hand-crafted global features, particularly in\nchallenging repetitively textured scenes and weakly textured scenes.

The injection\nweights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that\nbalances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy).\nEvaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded\nquality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance.

In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified\nframework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while\ngenerating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method\nconsists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which\nextracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over\nattributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven\nvideo generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided\nfacial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures\ntemporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches in lip-sync accuracy, video quality,\nand attribute controllability.

This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM\nresponses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different\ncultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can\nexacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such\nas education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,\nwe design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term\nchoice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to\ndifferently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting\nthe LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and\nTraditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading\ncommercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily\ntrained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses\nindicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and\nprompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified\nChinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored\nTraditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these\ndisparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written\ncharacter preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\nThese findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,\nwe provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations\nof future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants\n(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u548c\u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u504f\u597d\u548c\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3LLM\u5728\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u548c\u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5982\u6559\u80b2\u6216\u62db\u8058\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u533a\u57df\u672f\u8bed\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u533a\u57df\u540d\u79f0\u9009\u62e9\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3011\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570LLM\u5728\u533a\u57df\u672f\u8bed\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u533a\u57df\u540d\u79f0\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790LLM\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In contrast,\nour research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical\nconsideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs\nusing reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to\nsubstantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward\nfunction's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve\nrapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%,\ncompared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless\nrewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning\nphrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need\nto''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak\ndownstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models\ntrained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing\nthe importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR\nwith noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models,\nmitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on\nopen-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models'\nfoundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights\nfor advancing post-training techniques.

In this paper, we propose Auto\nLong-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that\nenables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on\nthe complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm,\nin which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when\nshorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed\nmethod, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY>\ntoken. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating\nlengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs'\nability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after\ntraining.

This\npaper situates Indo-Aryan languages within the typology of cross-linguistic\nnumeral systems, and explores the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that\nmay be responsible for the persistence of complex systems in these languages.\nUsing cross-linguistic data from multiple databases, we develop and employ a\nnumber of cross-linguistically applicable metrics to quantifies the complexity\nof languages' numeral systems, and demonstrate that Indo-Aryan languages have\ndecisively more complex numeral systems than the world's languages as a whole,\nthough individual Indo-Aryan languages differ from each other in terms of the\ncomplexity of the patterns they display. We investigate the factors (e.g.,\nreligion, geographic isolation, etc.) that underlie complexity in numeral\nsystems, with a focus on South Asia, in an attempt to develop an account of why\ncomplex numeral systems developed and persisted in certain Indo-Aryan languages\nbut not elsewhere. Finally, we demonstrate that Indo-Aryan numeral systems\nadhere to certain general pressures toward efficient communication found\ncross-linguistically, despite their high complexity. We call for this somewhat\noverlooked dimension of complexity to be taken seriously when discussing\ngeneral variation in cross-linguistic numeral systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5370\u6b27\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u53e4\u5409\u62c9\u7279\u8bed\u548c\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u6b27\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u57281-99\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u6c49\u8bed\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5370\u6b27\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u5730\u7406\u9694\u79bb\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5370\u6b27\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u9075\u5faa\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u538b\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u547c\u5401\u5728\u8ba8\u8bba\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u53d8\u5f02\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u8fd9\u79cd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite progress in VTS,\nexisting methods still fall short of the performance seen in ITS. This paper\nidentifies a key limitation in current video text spotters: limited recognition\ncapability, even after extensive end-to-end training. To address this, we\npropose GoMatching++, a parameter- and data-efficient method that transforms an\noff-the-shelf image text spotter into a video specialist. The core idea lies in\nfreezing the image text spotter and introducing a lightweight, trainable\ntracker, which can be optimized efficiently with minimal training data. Our\napproach includes two key components: (1) a rescoring mechanism to bridge the\ndomain gap between image and video data, and (2) the LST-Matcher, which\nenhances the frozen image text spotter's ability to handle video text. We\nexplore various architectures for LST-Matcher to ensure efficiency in both\nparameters and training data. As a result, GoMatching++ sets new performance\nrecords on challenging benchmarks such as ICDAR15-video, DSText, and BOVText,\nwhile significantly reducing training costs. To address the lack of curved text\ndatasets in VTS, we introduce ArTVideo, a new benchmark featuring over 30%\ncurved text with detailed annotations.

In this paper,\nwe propose HeadCLIP to overcome these limitations by effectively adapting both\ntext and image encoders to the domain. HeadCLIP generalizes the concepts of\nnormality and abnormality through learnable prompts in the text encoder, and\nintroduces learnable head weights to the image encoder to dynamically adjust\nthe features held by each attention head according to domain characteristics.\nAdditionally, we maximize the effect of domain adaptation by introducing a\njoint anomaly score that utilizes domain-adapted pixel-level information for\nimage-level anomaly detection.

This study explores the\nimplications of LLMs' responses on the representation of mass atrocity memory,\nexamining whether generative AI systems contribute to prosthetic memory, i.e.,\nmediated experiences of historical events, or to what we term \"prosthetic\ndenial,\" the AI-mediated erasure or distortion of atrocity memories. We argue\nthat LLMs function as interfaces that can elicit prosthetic memories and,\ntherefore, act as experiential sites for memory transmission, but also\nintroduce risks of denialism, particularly when their outputs align with\ncontested or revisionist narratives. To empirically assess these risks, we\nconducted a comparative audit of five LLMs (Claude, GPT, Llama, Mixtral, and\nGemini) across four historical case studies: the Holodomor, the Holocaust, the\nCambodian Genocide, and the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. Each model\nwas prompted with questions addressing common denialist claims in English and\nan alternative language relevant to each case (Ukrainian, German, Khmer, and\nFrench). Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally produce accurate\nresponses for widely documented events like the Holocaust, significant\ninconsistencies and susceptibility to denialist framings are observed for more\nunderrepresented cases like the Cambodian Genocide. The disparities highlight\nthe influence of training data availability and the probabilistic nature of LLM\nresponses on memory integrity.

However,\nimplementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process\nof creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while\nensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy\nconflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation\nfor Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent\ndeliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies.

Given the\nsignificant data sparsity and measurement uncertainty in radar height data,\nachieving automatic calibration during system operation has long been a\nchallenge. To address the sparsity issue, we propose a Dual-Perspective\nrepresentation that gathers features from both frontal and bird's-eye views.\nThe frontal view contains rich but sensitive height information, whereas the\nbird's-eye view provides robust features against height uncertainty. We thereby\npropose a novel Selective Fusion Mechanism to identify and fuse reliable\nfeatures from both perspectives, reducing the effect of height uncertainty.\nMoreover, for each view, we incorporate a Multi-Modal Cross-Attention Mechanism\nto explicitly find location correspondences through cross-modal matching.\nDuring the training phase, we also design a Noise-Resistant Matcher to provide\nbetter supervision and enhance the robustness of the matching mechanism against\nsparsity and height uncertainty. Our experimental results, tested on the\nnuScenes dataset, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nprevious radar-camera auto-calibration methods, as well as existing\nstate-of-the-art LiDAR-camera calibration techniques, establishing a new\nbenchmark for future research.

This\nleads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation\n(UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of\ncategory settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low\nconfidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to\nconfusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP:\nUniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework\ncomposed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based\nDistinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes,\nenabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the\nidentification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image\nMatching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels\nbased on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective\nlearning of common classes.

We find\nthat by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with\ninternal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on\ntasks previously deemed \"unsolvable\" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%).\nWe provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this\ncombination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on\ncontrolled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our\napproach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to\npreviously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically,\nwe show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling,\nsignificantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems.\nThese findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs\non complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically\nunderestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment\nof how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that\nfully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a\nbetter understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world\ndeployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9LLM\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u8d85\u96be\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728NP-hard\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe30\u500d\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However,\nthese models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during\ninference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant\ndeliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we\naim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from\nthe perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the\ntendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in\nthe model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the\nactivations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau\nand even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore\nsystematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking\nphenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that\nthe limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional\nsteering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a\nnovel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the\nlow-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the\ninterference noise.

To address this challenge, we propose Temporal\nRestoration and Spatial Rewiring (TERSE), a novel and concise SFDA method\ntailored for MTS data.

During the\ntarget adaptation phase, the target encoder is guided to produce spatially and\ntemporally consistent features with the source domain by leveraging the source\npre-trained temporal restoration and spatial rewiring networks. Therefore,\nTERSE can effectively model and transfer spatial-temporal dependencies across\ndomains, facilitating implicit feature alignment.

To address these issues, we propose TaylorKAN that leverages the Taylor\nexpansions as learnable activation functions to enhance local approximation\ncapability.

We conduct\nextensive experiments using ViT, Swin-Transformer and GPT, showing that our\noptimization strategy can effectively and stably train these Transformers\nwithout using learning rate warmup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u907f\u514dTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u9884\u70ed\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6076\u6027\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWeyl\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9650\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3ViT\u3001Swin-Transformer\u548cGPT\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u9884\u70ed\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Transformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging source-filter theory, our method\ninvolves two components: an acoustic path to predict prosody and a semantic\npath to extract linguistic features. This separation simplifies learning,\nallowing independent optimization of each representation. Additionally, we\nenhance performance by integrating speech units, a proven unsupervised speech\nrepresentation technique, into waveform generation alongside mel-spectrograms.\nThis allows RESOUND to synthesize prosodic speech while preserving content and\nspeaker identity.

By viewing standard\nclassifiers through an energy lens, we begin by analyzing how the energies of\nadversarial examples, generated by various attacks, differ from those of the\nnatural samples. The central focus of our work is to understand the critical\nphenomena of Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) in AT\nfrom an energy perspective. We analyze the impact of existing AT approaches on\nthe energy of samples during training and observe that the behavior of the\n``delta energy' -- change in energy between original sample and its adversarial\ncounterpart -- diverges significantly when CO or RO occurs. After a thorough\nanalysis of these energy dynamics and their relationship with overfitting, we\npropose a novel regularizer, the Delta Energy Regularizer (DER), designed to\nsmoothen the energy landscape during training. We demonstrate that DER is\neffective in mitigating both CO and RO across multiple benchmarks.

Choosing an appropriate\nkernel is therefore essential for consistent quantitative analysis. We propose\na multipath cycleGAN model for CT kernel harmonization, trained on a mixture of\npaired and unpaired data from a low-dose lung cancer screening cohort. The\nmodel features domain-specific encoders and decoders with a shared latent space\nand uses discriminators tailored for each domain.We train the model on 42\nkernel combinations using 100 scans each from seven representative kernels in\nthe National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. To evaluate performance, 240\nscans from each kernel are harmonized to a reference soft kernel, and emphysema\nis quantified before and after harmonization. A general linear model assesses\nthe impact of age, sex, smoking status, and kernel on emphysema. We also\nevaluate harmonization from soft kernels to a reference hard kernel. To assess\nanatomical consistency, we compare segmentations of lung vessels, muscle, and\nsubcutaneous adipose tissue generated by TotalSegmentator between harmonized\nand original images. Our model is benchmarked against traditional and\nswitchable cycleGANs. For paired kernels, our approach reduces bias in\nemphysema scores, as seen in Bland-Altman plots (p<0.05).
