However,\nphysiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels\nhinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain\nadaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,\nespecially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and\nunlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level\nself-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory\nbuffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and\npseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling\ngeneralization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for\nemotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for\naccurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast\nadaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and\neffective handling of evolving data streams.

In this paper, we propose SRMamba, a novel method for super-resolution\nof LiDAR point clouds in sparse scenes, addressing the key challenge of\nrecovering the 3D spatial structure of point clouds from novel views.\nSpecifically, we implement projection technique based on Hough Voting and Hole\nCompensation strategy to eliminate horizontally linear holes in range image.

The language priors\nin LVLMs originate from the linguistic knowledge inherited from their\npre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) backbone. Consequently, this\ncharacteristic is an intrinsic property of the model that remains independent\nof visual inputs. Inspired by the finding that language priors are consistent\nacross images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet\neffective training-free method to alleviate language priors in LVLMs. CICD\nfirst identifies essential and detrimental priors, and then employs contrastive\ndecoding to eliminate the detrimental ones. This approach simultaneously\nprevents LVLMs from generating hallucinated content while maintaining textual\nfluency and coherence. Furthermore, the limited information overlap between\nimages helps prevent visual information loss during contrastive decoding. We\nvalidate the effectiveness of CICD on four benchmarks with six LVLMs. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CICD performs remarkably well in mitigating\nlanguage priors, especially in the image captioning task, where such priors are\nmost pronounced.

Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense\nretrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream\nreasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a\nsignificant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the\nabstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal\nretrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval\n(SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce\npotential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by\nabstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries.

Although current\nNeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing\nbuilding-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference\nspeeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality\nrendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes.\nHowever, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an\neffective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required\noften lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges,\nwe propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for\noutdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the\ninitialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral\nmesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face,\neffectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions.

To tackle this issue, we propose RefPose, an innovative approach to\nobject pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric\ncorrespondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using\nobject templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric\ncorrespondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage,\nRefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the\ngenerated references and iteratively refines the pose through a\nrender-and-compare approach.

This study develops a comprehensive dynamic cardiac\nmodel research framework based on 4D-CTA, integrating digital twin technology,\ncomputer vision, and physical model manufacturing to provide precise,\npersonalized tools for interventional cardiology. Methods: Using 4D-CTA data\nfrom a 60-year-old female with three-vessel coronary stenosis, we segmented\ncardiac chambers and coronary arteries, constructed dynamic models, and\nimplemented skeletal skinning weight computation to simulate vessel deformation\nacross 20 cardiac phases.

Results: Morphological consistency\nbetween virtual and real angiography reached 80.9%.

This paper conducts a systematic\ninformation-theoretic analysis of the widely used cross-entropy loss in MLLMs,\nuncovering its implicit alignment objective. Our theoretical investigation\nreveals that this implicit objective has inherent limitations, leading to a\ndegradation of cross-modal alignment as text sequence length increases, thereby\nhindering effective multimodal information fusion. To overcome these drawbacks,\nwe propose Vision-Text Alignment (VISTA), a novel approach guided by our\ntheoretical insights.

The speech encoder is trained to generate\nConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary,\nwhich are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted\nsum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text\nembeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma\nmodels as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields\ngood performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM\nwith Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline\non 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of\nsettings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can\nbe switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we\npropose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax\ntemperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LegoSLM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ASR\u540e\u9a8c\u77e9\u9635\u8fde\u63a5\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ASR\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLLM\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528CTC\u540e\u9a8c\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6784\u4f2a\u97f3\u9891\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2aMLS\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747WERR\u63d0\u534749%\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LegoSLM\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This learning paradigm usually faces a significant challenge of unstable\nperformance caused by noisy pseudo-labels of instance categories and pixel\nmasks. We find that the prevalent practice of filtering instance pseudo-labels\nassessing both class and mask quality with a single score threshold, frequently\nleads to compromises in the trade-off between the qualities of class and mask\nlabels. In this paper, we introduce a novel Pseudo-Label Quality Decoupling and\nCorrection (PL-DC) framework for SSIS to tackle the above challenges. Firstly,\nat the instance level, a decoupled dual-threshold filtering mechanism is\ndesigned to decouple class and mask quality estimations for instance-level\npseudo-labels, thereby independently controlling pixel classifying and grouping\nqualities. Secondly, at the category level, we introduce a dynamic instance\ncategory correction module to dynamically correct the pseudo-labels of instance\ncategories, effectively alleviating category confusion. Lastly, we introduce a\npixel-level mask uncertainty-aware mechanism at the pixel level to re-weight\nthe mask loss for different pixels, thereby reducing the impact of noise\nintroduced by pixel-level mask pseudo-labels.

The early systems of diacritical marks\ncreated on top of the Quranic Consonantal Text (QCT) motivated the creation and\nfurther development of a fine-grained system of phonetic notation that\nrepresented tajwid-the rules of recitation. We explored the systematicity of\nthe rules of tajwid, as they are encountered in the Cairo Quran, using a fully\nand accurately encoded digital edition of the Quranic text. For this purpose,\nwe developed a python module that can remove or add the orthographic layer of\ntajwid from a Quranic text in CQO. The interesting characteristic of these two\nsets of rules is that they address the complete Quranic text of the Cairo\nQuran, so they can be used as precise witnesses to study its phonetic and\nprosodic processes. From a computational point of view, the text of the Cairo\nQuran can be used as a linchpin to align and compare Quranic manuscripts, due\nto its richness and completeness. This will let us create a very powerful\nframework to work with the Arabic script, not just within an isolated text, but\nautomatically exploring a specific textual phenomenon in other connected\nmanuscripts.

However, translating from Bahnaric to Vietnamese also encounters some\ndifficulties. The most prominent challenge is the lack of available original\nBahnaric resources source language, including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue\npatterns and bilingual corpus, which hinders the data collection process for\ntraining. To address this, we leverage a transfer learning approach using\nsequence-to-sequence pre-training language model. First of all, we leverage a\npre-trained Vietnamese language model to capture the characteristics of this\nlanguage. Especially, to further serve the purpose of machine translation, we\naim for a sequence-to-sequence model, not encoder-only like BERT or\ndecoder-only like GPT. Taking advantage of significant similarity between the\ntwo languages, we continue training the model with the currently limited\nbilingual resources of Vietnamese-Bahnaric text to perform the transfer\nlearning from language model to machine translation.

Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple\ncaptions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically\nsimilar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To\novercome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for\nVLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary\ninformation from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies\nthrough feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive\nimportance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two\ntechniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In\nthe first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual\nevaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique\nsentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique,\nimportance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of\nrelying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA\nstrategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance\non text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed\nstrategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS.

Not Final Version", "summary": "Concept erasing has recently emerged as an effective paradigm to prevent\ntext-to-image diffusion models from generating visually undesirable or even\nharmful content. However, current removal methods heavily rely on manually\ncrafted text prompts, making it challenging to achieve a high erasure\n(efficacy) while minimizing the impact on other benign concepts (usability). In\nthis paper, we attribute the limitations to the inherent gap between the text\nand image modalities, which makes it hard to transfer the intricately entangled\nconcept knowledge from text prompts to the image generation process. To address\nthis, we propose a novel solution by directly integrating visual supervision\ninto the erasure process, introducing the first text-image Collaborative\nConcept Erasing (Co-Erasing) framework. Specifically, Co-Erasing describes the\nconcept jointly by text prompts and the corresponding undesirable images\ninduced by the prompts, and then reduces the generating probability of the\ntarget concept through negative guidance. This approach effectively bypasses\nthe knowledge gap between text and image, significantly enhancing erasure\nefficacy. Additionally, we design a text-guided image concept refinement\nstrategy that directs the model to focus on visual features most relevant to\nthe specified text concept, minimizing disruption to other benign concepts.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments suggest that Co-Erasing outperforms\nstate-of-the-art erasure approaches significantly with a better trade-off\nbetween efficacy and usability.

Our benchmark is\nremarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation\nsubjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose\nCompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes\ncomplex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide\nfine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation\nelements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of\nalignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we\npropose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference\nsignals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities.\nUsing adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and\nflexible for different tasks.

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token\nspace by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and\nSoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can\nfurther enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode\ninformative thinking without the information loss associated with\nautoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in\ncontinuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling\nenables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous\nspace are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all\ndecoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling\nparadigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we\nperturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply\ncontrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations.\nExperiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures\ndemonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms\nSoftCoT with self-consistency scaling.

As the first\ncohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to\nimmersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving\ncommunication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by\ngaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from\nboth human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models\n(GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked\nharassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100\nrecent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the\nstudy reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for\nonline safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing\nGen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for\nyouth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems,\nhuman moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers;\nand (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability.\nFindings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth\ncommunication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults\nfail to understand their digital world.

Furthermore, a semi-supervised\ntraining strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech\ndatasets with different types of emotion annotations to train the UDDETTS.\nExperiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along the three\ndimensions of ADV space, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech\nsynthesis capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "UDDETTS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u60c5\u611fTTS\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u79bb\u6563\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ADV\u7a7a\u95f4\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u7b7e\u6216ADV\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUDDETTS\u80fd\u5728ADV\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u60c5\u611f\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UDDETTS\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u611fTTS\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet current user models remain fragmented, narrowly tailored to\nspecific apps, and incapable of the flexible reasoning required to fulfill\nthese visions. This paper presents an architecture for a general user model\n(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your\ncomputer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,\ndevice screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that\ncapture that user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is\npreparing for a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or\nrecognize that a user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft\nby observing multiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs\nintroduce an architecture that infers new propositions about a user from\nmultimodal observations, retrieves related propositions for context, and\ncontinuously revises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of\napplications that GUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based\nassistants with context, manage OS notifications to selectively surface\nimportant information, and enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences\nacross apps. We also instantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover\nand execute useful suggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our\nevaluations, we find that GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about\nusers, and that assistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform\nactions that users wouldn't think to request explicitly.

Although\nrecent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing\nperformance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward.\nHowever, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots\noften contain significant vagueness.

To this end, we\npropose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench),\nwhere we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning\nperformance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%.

However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model\nas the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may\ncauses significant performance degradation, especially when the compression\nrate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of\ndifferent base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the\npre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic\nBase Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target\ntask before performing delta compression.

Recent advances in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their\ncapabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,\ngenerating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,\ndespite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to\nevaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce\nEmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion\nhallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from\nthe interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven\nlearning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology\nprovides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on\nthis, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology\nknowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,\nwe utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs\ncarefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion\nhallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on\nEmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial\nissues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform\nopen-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability\nprovides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion\npsychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,\nthese findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an\naverage improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected\nmodels.

The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing\nexamples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed\nediting instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks.

However, no existing\nmethods address the automated segmentation of hippocampal subregions from\ntissue images, particularly from immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel set of four comprehensive murine hippocampal IHC\ndatasets featuring distinct staining modalities: cFos, NeuN, and multiplexed\nstains combining cFos, NeuN, and either {\\Delta}FosB or GAD67, capturing\nstructural, neuronal activity, and plasticity associated information.\nAdditionally, we propose ROIsGAN, a region-guided U-Net-based generative\nadversarial network tailored for hippocampal subregion segmentation. By\nleveraging adversarial learning, ROIsGAN enhances boundary delineation and\nstructural detail refinement through a novel region-guided discriminator loss\ncombining Dice and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluated across DG, CA1, and CA3\nsubregions, ROIsGAN consistently outperforms conventional segmentation models,\nachieving performance gains ranging from 1-10% in Dice score and up to 11% in\nIntersection over Union (IoU), particularly under challenging staining\nconditions. Our work establishes foundational datasets and methods for\nautomated hippocampal segmentation, enabling scalable, high-precision analysis\nof tissue images in neuroscience research.

Comprehensive ST\nanalysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the\nmissing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical\nfeasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the\nfirst attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate\npositions between adjacent ST slices.

To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a\ndistance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture\ncross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices,\n2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale\nbiological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that\nintegrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter\nand align the essential cellular features across ST and H\\&E images.

Experimental results across south China\nsea(SCS) and Kuroshio(KUR) regions from 1993 to 2020 demonstrate that CTP\nachieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in both single-step and multi-step\npredictions, significantly outperforming baseline models in accuracy, $F_1$\nscore, and temporal stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "CTP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u3001Transformer\u548cPINN\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u6d0b\u950b\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u6d0b\u950b\u9762\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u7269\u5730\u7403\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "CTP\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5357\u6d77\u548c\u9ed1\u6f6e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCTP\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CTP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d77\u6d0b\u950b\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite this, humans can effortlessly\nhandle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing\nresearch in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,\nprimarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment\nmanipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment\nspecifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,\nwhich features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and\nrefines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the\nsim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or\ntraining expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive\nand inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence\nto automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a\nsingle expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.\nHowever, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of\ngarments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve\ngeneralization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a\nHierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies\ntransferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then\ngenerates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate\nthat HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing\nto previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and\ndeformation where others fail.

This includes measuring\nthe spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers\n(myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light\nmicroscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D\norientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been\nintroduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer\nrange while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI\nacquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after\nmeasurement.

In addition, the\ncomplexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows\nfor a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep\nlearning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining\nof 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level.
