To address\nthis gap, we introduce CQ-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess\nLLMs' capability to infer implicit cultural values from natural conversational\ncontexts.

This work studies these phenomena by looking into the role of\ninformation flow between textual token representations. To this end, we\ngenerate images by applying the diffusion component on a subset of contextual\ntoken representations in a given prompt and observe several interesting\nphenomena. First, in many cases, a word or multiword expression is fully\nrepresented by one or two tokens, while other tokens are redundant. For\nexample, in \"San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge\", the token \"gate\" alone\ncaptures the full expression. We demonstrate the redundancy of these tokens by\nremoving them after textual encoding and generating an image from the resulting\nrepresentation. Surprisingly, we find that this process not only maintains\nimage generation performance but also reduces errors by 21\\% compared to\nstandard generation. We then show that information can also flow between\ndifferent expressions in a sentence, which often leads to semantic leakage.\nBased on this observation, we propose a simple, training-free method to\nmitigate semantic leakage: replacing the leaked item's representation after the\ntextual encoding with its uncontextualized representation.

Empirical evaluations on two models\nacross four benchmarks demonstrate that $\\mu$KE improves edit efficacy by up to\n12.33% over state-of-the-art methods, and remain robust when applied to diverse\nformatted edits, underscoring its potential for effective unstructured\nknowledge editing in LLMs.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMatryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing\uff08\u03bcKE\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u65e9\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Matryoshka\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u635f\u5931\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff08\u03bcKE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u03bcKE\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612.33%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03bcKE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of\nautonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based\noffline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed.\nHowever, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource\nconstraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due\nto the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric\nfeatures, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these\nrequirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a\nmiscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct\nregression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the\ncalibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a\ncontrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space\nto classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover,\nwe provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging\ncalibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach.

To fill this gap, ThinkPrune offers a simple solution that\ncontinuously trains the long-thinking LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL) with\nan added token limit, beyond which any unfinished thoughts and answers will be\ndiscarded, resulting in a zero reward.

Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to\ntheir amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires\nexpert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale\nvideo instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current\nsegmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets,\nfeaturing $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$\nframes) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including\ndrones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse\nvisual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water\ncolor variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico,\nCosta Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New\nZealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic\nscenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without\nrip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade\nMask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip\ncurrent segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a\nparticular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false\nnegatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel\npost-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA).

Over the past decade, my work has focused on developing a\nmorpheme-based annotation scheme for the Korean language that captures\nlinguistic properties from morphology to semantics. This approach has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including part-of-speech\ntagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. Additionally, this\nwork provides a comprehensive analysis of segmentation granularity and its\ncritical impact on NLP system performance. In parallel with linguistic resource\ndevelopment, I have proposed a novel evaluation framework, the jp-algorithm,\nwhich introduces an alignment-based method to address challenges in\npreprocessing tasks like tokenization and sentence boundary detection (SBD).\nTraditional evaluation methods assume identical tokenization and sentence\nlengths between gold standards and system outputs, limiting their applicability\nto real-world data. The jp-algorithm overcomes these limitations, enabling\nrobust end-to-end evaluations across a variety of NLP tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose CFMD, a novel\ncross-layer feature pyramid network that introduces two key innovations.

Second, we introduce an adaptive dynamic\nupsampling unit (CFLMD) that preserves spatial details during resolution\nrecovery. By adjusting the upsampling range dynamically and initializing with a\nbilinear strategy, the module effectively reduces feature overlap and maintains\nfine-grained boundary structures. Extensive experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD\nachieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary\nsegmentation quality, especially in complex scenes.

Existing works generally focus on collecting\nextensive domain-specific data and directly tuning the original CLIP models.\nIntuitively, such a paradigm takes no full consideration of the characteristics\nlying in domain-specific data (e.g., fine-grained nature of biological data)\nand so limits model capability, while mostly losing the original ability of\nCLIP in the general domain. In this paper, we propose a Distribution\nAlignment-based Language-Image Pre-Training (DALIP) method for biological data.\nSpecifically, DALIP optimizes CLIP models by matching the similarity between\nfeature distribution of image-text pairs instead of the original [cls] token,\nwhich can capture rich yet effective information inherent in image-text pairs\nas powerful representations, and so better cope with fine-grained nature of\nbiological data. Particularly, our DALIP efficiently approximates feature\ndistribution via its first- and second-order statistics, while presenting a\nMulti-head Brownian Distance Covariance (MBDC) module to acquire second-order\nstatistics of token features efficiently. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset\nfor plant domain (e.g., specific data in biological domain) comprising 10M\nplant data with 3M general-domain data (namely PlantMix-13M) according to data\nmixing laws. Extensive experiments show that DALIP clearly outperforms existing\nCLIP counterparts in biological domain, while well generalizing to remote\nsensing and medical imaging domains.

Specifically, a\ncontrastive-inspired semantic alignment is proposed to maximize the mutual\ninformation with the pre-trained models from OCT and OCTA views, to facilitate\ncodebook learning.

Among\nthe various types of deepfakes, lip-syncing deepfakes are one of the most\nchallenging deepfakes to detect. In these videos, a person's lip movements are\nsynthesized to match altered or entirely new audio using AI models. Therefore,\nunlike other types of deepfakes, the artifacts in lip-syncing deepfakes are\nconfined to the mouth region, making them more subtle and, thus harder to\ndiscern. In this paper, we propose LIPINC-V2, a novel detection framework that\nleverages a combination of vision temporal transformer with multihead\ncross-attention to detect lip-syncing deepfakes by identifying spatiotemporal\ninconsistencies in the mouth region. These inconsistencies appear across\nadjacent frames and persist throughout the video. Our model can successfully\ncapture both short-term and long-term variations in mouth movement, enhancing\nits ability to detect these inconsistencies.

Current\nmethods predominantly rely on a certain 3D representation (e.g., point cloud),\nwith few exploiting the 2D-3D consistency and complementary relationships,\nwhich constrains their performance. To bridge this gap, we propose to adopt\nmulti-view images and point clouds to jointly represent 3D shapes, facilitating\ntri-modal alignment (i.e., image, point, text) for enhanced cross-modal 3D\nretrieval. Notably, we introduce tri-modal reconstruction to improve the\ngeneralization ability of encoders. Given point features, we reconstruct image\nfeatures under the guidance of text features, and vice versa.

Our approach leverages denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate segmentation masks by progressively\nrefining noisy inputs conditioned on the corresponding images. The teacher\nmodel is first trained in an unsupervised manner using a cycle-consistency\nconstraint based on noise-corrupted image reconstruction, enabling it to\ngenerate informative semantic masks. Subsequently, the teacher is integrated\ninto a co-training process with a twin-student network. The student learns from\nground-truth labels when available and from teacher-generated pseudo-labels\notherwise, while the teacher continuously improves its pseudo-labeling\ncapabilities. Finally, to further enhance performance, we introduce a\nmulti-round pseudo-label generation strategy that iteratively improves the\npseudo-labeling process. We evaluate our approach on multiple biomedical\nimaging benchmarks, spanning multiple imaging modalities and segmentation\ntasks. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques, highlighting its effectiveness in\nscenarios with limited annotated data.

Although existing super-resolution-based methods show promising results\non public datasets, they often rely on idealized assumptions like accurate\nregion correspondences and reliable dToF inputs, overlooking calibration errors\nthat cause misalignment and anomaly signals inherent to dToF imaging, limiting\nreal-world applicability.

First, we propose a method to simulate\nreal-world dToF data from the accurate ground truth in synthetic datasets to\nenable noise-robust training. Second, we design a novel network that\nincorporates monocular depth estimation (MDE), leveraging global depth\nrelationships and contextual information to improve prediction in challenging\nregions.

Recently, there\nhas been a surge of interest in foreground-conditioned background inpainting, a\nsub-task that fills the background of an image while the foreground subject and\nassociated text prompt are provided. Existing background inpainting methods\ntypically strictly preserve the subject's original position from the source\nimage, resulting in inconsistencies between the subject and the generated\nbackground. To address this challenge, we propose a new task, the \"Text-Guided\nSubject-Position Variable Background Inpainting\", which aims to dynamically\nadjust the subject position to achieve a harmonious relationship between the\nsubject and the inpainted background, and propose the Adaptive Transformation\nAgent (A$^\\text{T}$A) for this task. Firstly, we design a PosAgent Block that\nadaptively predicts an appropriate displacement based on given features to\nachieve variable subject-position.

By employing a gating network to route input\ntokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the\ncorresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is\nchallenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation,\nwhich leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and\ninsufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by\nnumerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level.\nPrevious works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized\nby the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to\nstatic execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at\nruntime.

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic\nsegmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions,\na comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision\nmodels under localized corruptions remained underexplored.

The proposed metrics and analysis were evaluated on 15 segmentation\nmodels in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of\nlocalized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal\nthat models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance,\ntransformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to\nlocalized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and\nvice-versa for CNN-based models.

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency.

Our model is trained on a\nnovel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960\nresolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass.

To\nmitigate this, we propose a new paradigm for perception-oriented instruction\ntuning, i.e., Q-Adapt, which aims to eliminate the conflicts and achieve the\nsynergy between these two EIQA tasks when adapting LMM, resulting in enhanced\nmulti-faceted explanations of IQA.

Current horizon scanning faces\nchallenges in efficient information retrieval and analysis, especially from\nunstructured sources like news, presenting a need for innovative tools.\nMethodology: The study introduces SCANAR and AIDOC, open-source Python-based\ntools designed to improve horizon scanning. SCANAR automates the retrieval and\nprocessing of news articles, offering functionalities such as de-duplication\nand unsupervised relevancy ranking. AIDOC aids filtration by leveraging AI to\nreorder textual data based on relevancy, employing neural networks for semantic\nsimilarity, and subsequently prioritizing likely relevant entries for human\nreview. Results: Twelve internal datasets from horizon scans and four external\nbenchmarking datasets were used. SCANAR improved retrieval efficiency by\nautomating processes previously dependent on manual labour. AIDOC displayed\nwork-saving potential, achieving around 62% reduction in manual review efforts\nat 95% recall. Comparative analysis with benchmarking data showed AIDOC's\nperformance was similar to existing systematic review automation tools, though\nperformance varied depending on dataset characteristics. A smaller case-study\non our news datasets shows the potential of ensembling large language models\nwithin the active-learning process for faster detection of relevant articles\nacross news datasets. Conclusion: The validation indicates that SCANAR and\nAIDOC show potential to enhance horizon scanning efficiency by streamlining\ndata retrieval and prioritisation. These tools may alleviate methodological\nlimitations and allow broader, swifter horizon scans.

Initiatives such as\nthe ESA CCI map attempt to generate global biomass products from diverse\nspaceborne sensors but at a coarser resolution. To enable global,\nhigh-resolution (HR) mapping, several works propose to regress AGB from HR\nsatellite observations such as ESA Sentinel-1/2 images. We propose a novel way\nto address HR AGB estimation, by leveraging both HR satellite observations and\nexisting low-resolution (LR) biomass products. We cast this problem as Guided\nSuper-Resolution (GSR), aiming at upsampling LR biomass maps (sources) from\n$100$ to $10$ m resolution, using auxiliary HR co-registered satellite images\n(guides). We compare super-resolving AGB maps with and without guidance,\nagainst direct regression from satellite images, on the public BioMassters\ndataset. We observe that Multi-Scale Guidance (MSG) outperforms direct\nregression both for regression ($-780$ t/ha RMSE) and perception ($+2.0$ dB\nPSNR) metrics, and better captures high-biomass values, without significant\ncomputational overhead. Interestingly, unlike the RGB+Depth setting they were\noriginally designed for, our best-performing AGB GSR approaches are those that\nmost preserve the guide image texture. Our results make a strong case for\nadopting the GSR framework for accurate HR biomass mapping at scale.

To leverage the real-world knowledge\nembedded in the pre-trained diffusion models, we propose a Diffusion-based\nframework specifically designed for Occluded Object Movement, named DiffOOM.\nThe proposed DiffOOM consists of two parallel branches that perform object\nde-occlusion and movement simultaneously.

In\nthis paper, we take a step further towards visual granularity unified RES task.\nTo overcome the limitation of data scarcity, we introduce a new\nmulti-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task, alongside the\nRefCOCOm benchmark, which includes part-level annotations for advancing\nfiner-grained visual understanding. In addition, we create MRES-32M, the\nlargest visual grounding dataset, comprising over 32.2M masks and captions\nacross 1M images, specifically designed for part-level vision-language\ngrounding. To tackle the challenges of multi-granularity RES, we propose\nUniRES++, a unified multimodal large language model that integrates\nobject-level and part-level RES tasks. UniRES++ incorporates targeted designs\nfor fine-grained visual feature exploration. With the joint model architecture\nand parameters, UniRES++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\nbenchmarks, including RefCOCOm for MRES, gRefCOCO for generalized RES, and\nRefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg for classic RES. To foster future research into\nmulti-grained visual grounding, our RefCOCOm benchmark, MRES-32M dataset and\nmodel UniRES++ will be publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Rubics-Xuan/MRES.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee3\u8868\u8fbe\u5206\u5272\uff08MRES\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578bUniRES++\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6RES\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\u7684\u6307\u4ee3\u8868\u8fbe\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6RES\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MRES\u4efb\u52a1\u548cRefCOCOm\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u521b\u5efaMRES-32M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faUniRES++\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7RES\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "UniRES++\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ecRefCOCOm\u3001gRefCOCO\u548cRefCOCO\u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7RefCOCOm\u57fa\u51c6\u3001MRES-32M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cUniRES++\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Conventional methods have developed specialized\nsolutions (e.g., geometry regularization or feed-forward deterministic model)\nto mitigate the issue. However, they still suffer from performance degradation\nby minimal overlap across input views with insufficient visual information.\nFortunately, recent video generative models show promise in addressing this\nchallenge as they are capable of generating video clips with plausible 3D\nstructures. Powered by large pretrained video diffusion models, some pioneering\nresearch start to explore the potential of video generative prior and create 3D\nscenes from sparse views. Despite impressive improvements, they are limited by\nslow inference time and the lack of 3D constraint, leading to inefficiencies\nand reconstruction artifacts that do not align with real-world geometry\nstructure.

Specifically, we design a\n3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy to leap over time-consuming redundant\ninformation and train a dynamic denoising policy network to adaptively\ndetermine the optimal leap timestep during inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our VideoScene achieves faster and superior 3D scene\ngeneration results than previous video diffusion models, highlighting its\npotential as an efficient tool for future video to 3D applications.

This differs from the standard\napproaches to video learning where videos are chopped and shuffled during\ntraining in order to create a non-redundant batch that satisfies the\nindependently and identically distributed (IID) sample assumption expected by\nconventional training paradigms. When videos are only available as a continuous\nstream of input, the IID assumption is evidently broken, leading to poor\nperformance. We demonstrate the drop in performance when moving from shuffled\nto sequential learning on three tasks: the one-video representation learning\nmethod DoRA, standard VideoMAE on multi-video datasets, and the task of future\nvideo prediction. To address this drop, we propose a geometric modification to\nstandard optimizers, to decorrelate batches by utilising orthogonal gradients\nduring training. The proposed modification can be applied to any optimizer --\nwe demonstrate it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and AdamW. Our\nproposed orthogonal optimizer allows models trained from streaming videos to\nalleviate the drop in representation learning performance, as evaluated on\ndownstream tasks.

To address these challenges, we introduce\nForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four\nconfigurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for\nvarious sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or\nSuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data.

Finally, we release an industrial-standard, large-scale,\nhigh-fidelity garment dataset featuring detailed annotations, vertex-wise\ncorrespondences, and a robust pipeline for converting unstructured production\nsewing patterns into GarmageNet standard structural assets, paving the way for\nlarge-scale, industrial-grade garment generation systems.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGarmage\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u975e\u6c34\u5bc6\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6c34\u5bc6\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "Garmage\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc2D-3D\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6bcf\u9762\u677f\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u65e0\u7f1d\u7f16\u7801\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GarmageNet\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7f1d\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "GarmageNet\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u73b0\u6709\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u670d\u88c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "Garmage\u548cGarmageNet\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u670d\u88c5\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We systematically evaluate a range of\nstate-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature\nextraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion\ntechniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM)\npredictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron\nclassifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity\nprediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification\n(considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that\nutterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for\ntext and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM\npredictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8%\nfor depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM\narchitectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of\nexternal LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and\nassessment of mental health conditions.

This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps\nand understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives.\nHowever, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets,\nlimiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the\ntemporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES\ndataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables,\nspanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a\ntemplate-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both\ntemplates and questions.
