Existing literature reveals there is a limited\navailability of TOG datasets for training and benchmarking despite large\ndemand, which are often synthetic or have artifacts in mask annotations that\nhinder model performance. Moreover, TOG solutions often require affordance\nmasks, grasps, and object masks for training, however, existing datasets\ntypically provide only a subset of these annotations. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the Top-down Task-oriented Grasping (TD-TOG) dataset,\ndesigned to train and evaluate TOG solutions. TD-TOG comprises 1,449 real-world\nRGB-D scenes including 30 object categories and 120 subcategories, with\nhand-annotated object masks, affordances, and planar rectangular grasps. It\nalso features a test set for a novel challenge that assesses a TOG solution's\nability to distinguish between object subcategories. To contribute to the\ndemand for TOG solutions that can adapt and manipulate previously unseen\nobjects without re-training, we propose a novel TOG framework, Binary-TOG.\nBinary-TOG uses zero-shot for object recognition, and one-shot learning for\naffordance recognition. Zero-shot learning enables Binary-TOG to identify\nobjects in multi-object scenes through textual prompts, eliminating the need\nfor visual references. In multi-object settings, Binary-TOG achieves an average\ntask-oriented grasp accuracy of 68.9%.

Despite significant advances in\nmemory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems\nstill have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or\nreflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated\nerrors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this\nvision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift\ndetection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into\nsystems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,\njudgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in\ncurrent AI architectures and governance efforts.

Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately\nclustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the\naccuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively. This gap\neven increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean\ndistance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,\nplaces greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is\ncontrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization\nerrors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector\nQuantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two\nkey modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors\ninto their polar coordinate representations and perform independent\nquantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned\nCodebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude\ncodebooks in accordance with the source distribution.

Hadi Amini"], "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and\nfine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources\nacross organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It\naddresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated\nwith the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive\nfor small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of\ntask-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains\nvulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient\ninversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized\nDifferential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at\npreserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters,\nenabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the\nattack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore,\noptimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability\nand efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA\nsubstantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL\nfeasible for resource-constrained clients.

This problem\nis challenging due to the partial observability of the environment and the\nincompleteness of the sensor feedback. To solve it, we first model the system\nwith simple analytic state and action models based on quasi-static dynamics\nassumptions. We then study the fully-observable case where the state of both\nthe Velcro and the robot are given. For this case, we obtain the optimal\nsolution in closed-form which minimizes the total energy cost.

The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not\ndesigned for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated\nenvironments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the\nchallenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions\nand device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting\nand degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a\nnovel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion\nmechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,\nFedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally\nseparating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained\nrepresentations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks\nto clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.\nThis enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated\nenvironments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive\nexperiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,\nFedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after\nfine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without\ndegrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05977v1"}

Yet, successful navigation still relies on two key\ncapabilities: mapping and planning, whether explicit or implicit. Classical\napproaches use explicit mapping pipelines to register ego-centric observations\ninto a coherent map frame for the planner. In contrast, end-to-end learning\nachieves this implicitly, often through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that\nfuse current and past observations into a latent space for planning. While\narchitectures such as LSTM and GRU capture temporal dependencies, our findings\nreveal a key limitation: their inability to perform effective spatial\nmemorization. This skill is essential for transforming and integrating\nsequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial\nrepresentations that support downstream planning.

We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing\nthe loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of\nloss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type\nof degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL).

Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty\nquantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and\nclassification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that\npresuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a\nquery only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from\nfinite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off\nbetween coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce\nConformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the\noptimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is\nbuilt on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the\nother defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.\nRemarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in\nstatistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of\ndecay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel\nestimator.

Leveraging the\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel\nLLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban\ncontext.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine\nActivity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to\nprocess rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal\nbehavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating\nenvironmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be\nchallenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated\ndataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a\ntraining-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities\ndemonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning\nbaselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,\nachieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we\nconduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy\ninterventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime\npatterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual\nscenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual\nbehaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.AI", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05981v1"}

In particular, we study two\nfamilies of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first\nhierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the\nbootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast\nconvergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This\ncondition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising\nmodels on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov\nchain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the\noptimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this\nhierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.\nBoth hierarchies lead to an $\\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation\nvalues using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\\varepsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be\nembedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$.

In this work, we introduce a novel\nPCB forensics approach using explainable AI (XAI) on impedance signatures.\nThrough extensive experiments, we replicate various PCB tamper events,\ngenerating a dataset used to develop an XAI algorithm capable of not only\ndetecting tampering but also explaining why the algorithm makes a decision\nabout whether a tamper event has happened. At the core of our XAI algorithm is\na random forest classifier with an accuracy of 96.7%, sufficient to explain the\nalgorithm's decisions. To understand the behavior of the classifier in the\ndecision-making process, we utilized SHAP values as an XAI tool to determine\nwhich frequency component influences the classifier's decision for a particular\nclass the most. This approach enhances detection capabilities as well as\nadvancing the verifier's ability to reverse-engineer and analyze\ntwo-dimensional impedance signatures for forensics.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05734v1"}

However, their\nwidespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data\nprivacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats\nposed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing\non contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal\nthe significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy\nleakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction\nperformance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,\nthis paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the\np-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack\n(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical\ndistribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental\nresults across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA\noutperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly\nunder limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers\nthe potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but\nalso provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder\nmodels.

We study the features of this model and\nits effect on reentrancy bugs on three examples: the Internet Computer (ICP)\nblockchain, NEAR Protocol, and MultiversX. We argue that this model, while\nuseful for improving performance, also makes it easier to introduce reentrancy\nbugs. For example, reviews of the pre-production versions of some of the most\ncritical ICP smart contracts found that 66% (10/15) of the reviewed contracts\n-- written by expert authors -- contained reentrancy bugs of medium or high\nseverity, with potential damages in tens of millions of dollars.

Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and\nEffective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one\nsign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.\n  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling\nwith rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing\nprobability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for\nepsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.\n  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH\n(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against\nDPSGD and Non-DP baselines.

To\nenable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over\n1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually\ncurated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic\nhallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for\nscene text spotting and understanding.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05551v1"}

Unlike existing methods that either produce\nmonolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an\nimage and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,\ncompositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented\ninputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D\nparts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and\ncomplex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh\ndiffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained\nweights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A\ncompositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of\ndisentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables\nstructured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,\nensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.\nTo support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level\nannotations from large-scale 3D object datasets.

However, existing methods commonly overlook the key\ndifferences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth\nranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with\nlow-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive\nDepth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve\nmulti-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth\nrange predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal\nestimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the\nrange map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth\nboundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating\nconvergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are\nprogressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for\nprecise depth regression.

However, existing methods commonly overlook the key\ndifferences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth\nranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with\nlow-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive\nDepth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve\nmulti-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth\nrange predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal\nestimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the\nrange map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth\nboundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating\nconvergence to local optima.

We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,\nSavitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)\nlabeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,\nlatency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing\nand hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the\nperformance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater\ninterpretability.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05764v1"}

We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing\nthe loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of\nloss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type\nof degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,\nper-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive\ninterference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one\nsubset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss\ndeceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying\nlanguage model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to\nimprove language models independent of scale.

Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs\nhinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this\npaper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which\nis derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured\nrepresentations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with\n0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and\nunstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands\nstructured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving\ndecisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive\nachieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%\naccuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive\nparameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,\nablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,\nweather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance\non decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05442v1"}

This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing\nand instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a\nbroad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically\ntargeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a\ncomprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average\naccuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on\npublic benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like\nprotectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's\narchitecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a\nthorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.", "comment": "6 pages, 2 tables", "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05446v1"}

We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space.

The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not\ndesigned for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated\nenvironments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively.

Thus,\nwe consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information\nfrom natural oracles.

However, they often struggle with\ncapturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and\nsuffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on\nlocal message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these\nlimitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network\n(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)\nRolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of\ndiffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising\nsteps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built\non algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across\ndifferent mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via\nAlgebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local\ndynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending\nor multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid\nmechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.\nROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially\noutperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference\ntime by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06045v1"}

Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty\nquantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and\nclassification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that\npresuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a\nquery only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from\nfinite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off\nbetween coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce\nConformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the\noptimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is\nbuilt on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the\nother defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.\nRemarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in\nstatistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of\ndecay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel\nestimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,\nwhich we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to\nimplementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,\nand often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open\nended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and\nhighlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,\nand (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets\nthan existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05497v1"}

Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning\nalgorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic.

Traditionally, this exercise\ninvolves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the\nunderlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt\nfoundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy\ntraining while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting\nLarge Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description\nof the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a\nsingle inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained\nLoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA\ninstances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the\ncorresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA\ninstances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach\nprovides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of\nfoundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute\nrequirements.

In deep learning, a significant\nchallenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced\noptimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient\ndescent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the\nmultitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would\nhinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge\narises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different\nmagnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to\ninterfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient\nsurgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting\ngradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a\nnovel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery\n(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient\nmagnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS\nsurgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order\nmomentum.

Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent\nvelocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target\npoints. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training\nflow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing\nexists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much\nharder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points\nindependently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to\ntrain, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would\ngreatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal\ntransport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a\nhighly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In\npractice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and\n$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.\nThese works have advocated using batches of size $n\\approx 256$, and considered\nOT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the\nHungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.\nSinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits\nof increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully\non the effect of the entropic regularization $\\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to\nreport the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across\nmultiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$.

This paper bridges this\ngap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with\na focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first\nshow that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with\nor without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more\nthan the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also\ncompletely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks\nhave the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We\nthen introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of\nparameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual\nblock, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of\nsuch laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in\nisolation.

Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link\nannual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix\nto the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis\nshows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with\na standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence\nemissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode\nmaterial processing.

However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin.

The effectiveness of\npredictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While\ntraditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the\nabsolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various\nranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to\nfocus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,\nthe effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been\nthoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive\nstudy on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three\nmain types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we\nassess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks\nacross five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss\nfunctions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.\nFurthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting\nappropriate loss functions for various tasks.

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains.

This framework leverages recent developments in 3D\nGaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced\nSemantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method\ndecodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them\nonto the 2D camera view.

These\ndevices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a\nsubstantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated\nadversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance\nmodel robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently\nproduces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and\nheterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently\npersonalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication\nchallenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose\n\\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework\ndesigned to deliver customized defense models for each client through a\ntwo-phase process. In Phase 1, \\textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local\nadversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while\ndrastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters\nduring federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy\nis introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the\npersonalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored\ndefense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively.

During the skill pretraining\nphase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives\nof exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance\non heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a\nskill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream\ntasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves\nperformance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These\nresults highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and\ndiversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and\ngeneralizable skill learning.

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning.

It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices.

However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nnamed Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the\nfine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and\ntext modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,\ni.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder\n(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality\nsemantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same\ncriteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each\nmodule first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional\nsupervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair.

This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to\nsystematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven\napproach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and\nsputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition\ndistribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ\nmeasurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter\nchamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of\nthe sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using\nGaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of\nthe deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of\nthe deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We\ninvestigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure.

In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected\nto the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled\nby a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this\npaper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be\ndifferent. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should\nbe injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new\nframework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).\nSpecifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data\npoint deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms).

We conducted a thematic analysis of 44\nsemi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised\nethnicities in the UK.

But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,\nwhile suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer\ncontext. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been\nproposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a\nlong video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.\nDifferent from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long\nvideos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it\ncan progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into\nthese shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the\nshot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking\nprocess, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for\nthoughtful understanding in long videos.

We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where\nrelevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple\nmodalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must\ndynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the\nquery. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that\njointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,\nand metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal\nbackbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic\nmodality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training\ndata for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale\nsynthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in\nvarious languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we\npropose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard\ncontrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality\nusage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation\nstrategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade\nperformance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities.

However, existing\nmethods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation\nstrategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and\noperate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs\ngenerated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first\nestimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a\ngraphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled\naugmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset\nand estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared\nsemantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the\nadvantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06212v1"}

We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains.

In particular, we study two\nfamilies of linear programming hierarchies for this problem.

For this hierarchy, we prove fast\nconvergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This\ncondition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising\nmodels on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov\nchain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the\noptimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this\nhierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.\nBoth hierarchies lead to an $\\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation\nvalues using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\\varepsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be\nembedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$.
