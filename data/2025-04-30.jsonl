As sports fields have\nrigorous specifications in terms of shape and dimensions of their line, circle\nand point components, sports field markings are commonly used as calibration\ntargets for this task. However, because of the sparse and uneven distribution\nof field markings, close-up camera views around central areas of the field\noften depict only line and circle markings.

With their ability to model\nobject surfaces in a scene as a continuous function, such techniques have made\nremarkable strides recently, especially over classical 3D surface\nreconstruction methods, such as those that use voxels or point clouds. However,\nthese methods struggle with scenes that have varied and complex surfaces\nprincipally because they model any given scene with a single encoder network\nthat is tasked to capture all of low through high-surface frequency information\nin the scene simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel, neural implicit\nsurface representation approach called FreBIS to overcome this challenge.\nFreBIS works by stratifying the scene based on the frequency of surfaces into\nmultiple frequency levels, with each level (or a group of levels) encoded by a\ndedicated encoder. Moreover, FreBIS encourages these encoders to capture\ncomplementary information by promoting mutual dissimilarity of the encoded\nfeatures via a novel, redundancy-aware weighting module. Empirical evaluations\non the challenging BlendedMVS dataset indicate that replacing the standard\nencoder in an off-the-shelf neural surface reconstruction method with our\nfrequency-stratified encoders yields significant improvements.

Different from previous attacks that fuse the unsafe\ntarget prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily\ndetected or may generate non-unsafe images due to under- or over-optimization,\nwe propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against the memory\nmechanism in real-world text-to-image generation systems. Inception embeds the\nmalice at the inception of the chat session turn by turn, leveraging the\nmechanism that T2I generation systems retrieve key information in their memory.\nSpecifically, Inception mainly consists of two modules. It first segments the\nunsafe prompt into chunks, which are subsequently fed to the system in multiple\nturns, serving as pseudo-gradients for directive optimization. Specifically, we\ndevelop a series of segmentation policies that ensure the images generated are\nsemantically consistent with the target prompt. Secondly, after segmentation,\nto overcome the challenge of the inseparability of minimum unsafe words, we\npropose recursion, a strategy that makes minimum unsafe words subdivisible.\nCollectively, segmentation and recursion ensure that all the request prompts\nare benign but can lead to malicious outcomes. We conduct experiments on the\nreal-world text-to-image generation system ($i.e.$, DALL$\\cdot$E 3) to validate\nthe effectiveness of Inception. The results indicate that Inception surpasses\nthe state-of-the-art by a 14\\% margin in attack success rate."}

Our experiments demonstrate that the detoxifying text distilled from\nGPT-2 can effectively detoxify larger models, including OPT, Falcon, and\nLLaMA-2.

These mechanisms can be\nbroadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal\nshifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to\nreduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid\ndisparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel\ndisplacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform\nimplicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby\ncapturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first\ncomputes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view\nfeatures to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then\nnormalized into an \"explicit pixel-wise attention score\" to perform the\ncross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to\nanother. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural\nstereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key\ncoding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction\n(HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM).

We show that IR-specialised neural models achieve the\nhighest overall performance with other approaches performing comparably.\nAdditionally, the re-ranking of the probabilistic model's results with neural\nmodels only introduces modest improvements of 0.07 at most in F1-score.\nQualitative post-hoc evaluation by survey specialists shows that models\ngenerally have a low sensitivity to questions with high lexical overlap,\nparticularly in cases where sub-concepts are mismatched. Altogether, our\nanalysis serves to further research on harmonising longitudinal studies in\nsocial science."}

In addition, constructing size-invariant\ncorrespondences between these parts is important for cross-category transfer.\nBased on these insights, we introduce a novel method PartHOI for part-based HOI\ntransfer. Using a generalized cylinder representation to parameterize an object\nparts' geometry, PartHOI establishes a robust geometric correspondence between\nobject parts, and enables the transfer of contact points. Given the transferred\npoints, we optimize a hand pose to fit the target object well. Qualitative and\nquantitative results demonstrate that our method can generalize HOI transfers\nwell even for cross-category objects, and produce high-fidelity results that\nare superior to the existing methods."}

Its applicability is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments\nusing three well known serial manipulators and two RGB-D cameras. With only\nthree randomly chosen robot configurations, our approach achieves approximately\n90% successful calibrations, demonstrating 2-3x higher convergence rates to the\nglobal optimum compared to both marker-based and marker-free baselines. We also\nreport 2 orders of magnitude faster convergence time (0.8 +/- 0.4 s) for 9\nrobot configurations over other marker-free methods. Our method exhibits\nsignificantly improved accuracy (5 mm in task space) over classical approaches\n(7 mm in task space) whilst being marker-free.

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral topological dynamics model to fold complex clothing. By utilizing the\nvisible folding structure as the topological skeleton, we design a novel\ntopological graph to represent the clothing state. This topological graph is\nlow-dimensional and applied for complex clothing in various folding states. It\nindicates the constraints of clothing and enables predictions regarding\nclothing movement. To extract graphs from self-occlusion, we apply semantic\nsegmentation to analyze the occlusion relationships and decompose the clothing\nstructure. The decomposed structure is then combined with keypoint detection to\ngenerate the topological graph. To analyze the behavior of the topological\ngraph, we employ an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the general\ndynamics. The GNN model can predict the deformation of clothing and is employed\nto calculate the deformation Jacobi matrix for control. Experiments using\njackets validate the algorithm's effectiveness to recognize and fold complex\nclothing with self-occlusion."}

However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a\ntext-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other\nmodalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single\nmodality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the\ntype of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot\naddress. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework\ndesigned to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with\ndiverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the\nobservation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space\nderived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the\nretrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose\na modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most\nappropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it.\nAlso, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity\nlevels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of\nthe query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple\nmodalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified\nbaselines."}

Detecting such manipulations is especially\nchallenging under open-world conditions, where spoofing methods encountered\nduring testing may differ from those seen during training. In this work, we\npropose an end-to-end deep learning framework for audio deepfake detection that\noperates directly on raw waveforms. Our model, RawNetLite, is a lightweight\nconvolutional-recurrent architecture designed to capture both spectral and\ntemporal features without handcrafted preprocessing. To enhance robustness, we\nintroduce a training strategy that combines data from multiple domains and\nadopts Focal Loss to emphasize difficult or ambiguous samples. We further\ndemonstrate that incorporating codec-based manipulations and applying\nwaveform-level audio augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, noise, and time\nstretching) leads to significant generalization improvements under realistic\nacoustic conditions. The proposed model achieves over 99.7% F1 and 0.25% EER on\nin-domain data (FakeOrReal), and up to 83.4% F1 with 16.4% EER on a challenging\nout-of-distribution test set (AVSpoof2021 + CodecFake).
