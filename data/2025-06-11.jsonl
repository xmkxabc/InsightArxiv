GradEscape overcomes the\nundifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by\nintroducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector\ninput. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim\ndetectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To\naddress the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we\nintroduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to\ndetectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel\ntokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective\nevasion even in query-only access.\n  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language\nmodels, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders\nin various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing\nonly 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world\ncommercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability\nstems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We\nalso propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT\nevaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT\ndetectors.", "comment": "Accepted to USENIX Security'25", "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08188v1"}

We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of\nagent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces\nand by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior\nof both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By\nanalyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns\nin infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and\ndefender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally\nable to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being\nexploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the\nvarious possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and\nwhich did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99%\nineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding\nfor instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant\nprivileged access to a host.

Docker is a leading provider of\ncontainerisation, and through the Docker Hub, users can supply Docker images\nfor sharing and re-purposing popular software application containers. Using a\ncombination of in-built inspection commands, publicly displayed image layer\ncontent, and static image scanning, Docker images are designed to ensure end\nusers can clearly assess the content of the image before running them. In this\npaper we present \\textbf{\\textit{gh0stEdit}}, a vulnerability that\nfundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the\nassumed trust and transparency they utilise. The use of gh0stEdit allows an\nattacker to maliciously edit Docker images, in a way that is not shown within\nthe image history, hierarchy or commands.

Traditional countermeasures, such as masking, face\nchallenges including complex integration during synthesis, substantial area\noverhead, and susceptibility to optimization removal during logic synthesis. To\naddress these issues, we introduce PoSyn, a novel logic synthesis framework\ndesigned to enhance cryptographic hardware resistance against PSC attacks. Our\nmethod centers on optimal bipartite mapping of vulnerable RTL components to\nstandard cells from the technology library, aiming to minimize PSC leakage. By\nutilizing a cost function integrating critical characteristics from both the\nRTL design and the standard cell library, we strategically modify mapping\ncriteria during RTL-to-netlist conversion without altering design\nfunctionality. Furthermore, we theoretically establish that PoSyn minimizes\nmutual information leakage, strengthening its security against PSC\nvulnerabilities. We evaluate PoSyn across various cryptographic hardware\nimplementations, including AES, RSA, PRESENT, and post-quantum cryptographic\nalgorithms such as Saber and CRYSTALS-Kyber, at technology nodes of 65nm, 45nm,\nand 15nm.

Tensor-based methods provide a\npowerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution\nthrough low-rank decompositions.

Due to practical\nconstraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a\nfraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only\nhinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution.\nSuch aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying\nlatent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally\nuncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a\npowerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution\nthrough low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically\nlack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node\nsignals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and\noverlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic\ngraph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear\ncombination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint\nevolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we\nestimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures\nvia alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a\nstationary point.

First, audits often adhere to a single method of text\nstandardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR\nperformance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be\nconsistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech\ncommunities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized.

While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has\nbeen widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To\nthis end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of\nmodel activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths\nin their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength\ncausally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.\nSpecifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely\nbased on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs\nestimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs\nencode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector\nembedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude\nmodulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced\nreasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to\nincreased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further\nreveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length\nprediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to\naffect the reasoning length.

ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and\nstandardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and\nequitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and\nlanguage disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR\nsystems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in\nexisting standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them\nimpacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance\nfor aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text\nstandardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR\nperformance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be\nconsistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech\ncommunities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second,\naudits often display high-level demographic findings without further\nconsidering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic\nsubgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the\ninput audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the\nWord Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising\nfrom generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a\nmore holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and\nexemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR\nperformance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group.

However, there exists a class of state\nestimation problems with unknown statistical properties of noise disturbances,\nand it is worth discussing whether the invariant observer still has performance\nadvantages. In this paper, considering the problem of state estimation with\nunknown but bounded noise disturbances, an Invariant Zonotopic Set-Membership\nFilter (InZSMF) method on groups is innovatively proposed, which extends the\ninvariant filtering theory to the field of non-statistical filtering\nrepresented by set-membership filtering. Firstly, the InZSMF method transforms\nthe state space from the traditional Euclidean vector space to the Lie group\nspace to construct group affine discrete systems with unknown but bounded noise\nuncertainty defined by the zonotope on groups. Secondly, the nonlinear observer\non the group is defined and the corresponding linearized estimation error is\nderived.

First, audits often adhere to a single method of text\nstandardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR\nperformance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be\nconsistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech\ncommunities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized.

The core contributions of HierC_Q are twofold. First, considering the\nintrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is\nproposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration\nprocess towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical\narchitecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve\n(L2I) tier and the \"disturb to renovate\" (D2R) tier.

The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from\nboth engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role\nas both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental\nchallenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around\nprivacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job\ndisplacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this\ncourse lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical\napproach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results\nrevealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse\nmetrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)\nefficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated\nthe evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our\nlives.", "comment": "Accepted for publication at AIED 2025 in the late-breaking work track", "cate": "cs.CY", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08041v1"}

To further enhance discriminative\npower, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.\nExtensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS\nPotsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing\napproaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in\nthe majority of semantic categories.

At the scene level, existing SSL methods often\nincorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D\nimages as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs.

While traditional optimization methods such as\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain\nfoundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new\napproaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper\nprovides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI\nsystems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We\nformalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing\nmethods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges\nand future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework\nthat quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the\ntraining data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose\nDecentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of\ntraining and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only\nmodel parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and\ndeployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target\nsample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on\nfour medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,\nhistopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against\nexisting methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD\ndetection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers\ncould provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of\ntheir training data for OOD detection services.

Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,\npowering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research\nattention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level\nsemantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often\nimplicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.\nCurrent embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth\nand evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a\nresult, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker\nstance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that\neven state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic\nbaselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm\nshift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically\ngrounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic\nunderstanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling\nobjective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08354v1"}

As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information.

Moreover, the exponential\ngrowth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and\nhighly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the\ncomplexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and\nmetaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating\noptimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to\nadapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of\nedge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been\nincorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions\ninherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant\nlimitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time\nrequired to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale\nproblems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and\nfrequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study\nproposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs\ninformed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the\npredictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and\nconvergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the\ntasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing.

While the L2 loss\nfunction is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the\ncorresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex\nequations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet\naccelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function\nusing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel\nPacket (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that\nKP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical\nexperiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations\neffectively and efficiently.

Zeroth-order\n(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward\npasses, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to\nconverge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally\nimproved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater\nmemory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast\nZeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward\npasses needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that\nadapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also\naccelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector\nperturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,\nacross 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms\nMeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For\nRoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy\nand an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving\nconvergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis\nproving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its\nconvergence guarantees.

Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the\nWasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive\nnoise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical\nexperiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well\nas their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.", "comment": null, "cate": "math.NA", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08761v1"}

Fingerprinting and black-box\nwatermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining\nmodel similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership\ncollisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.\nThe latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of\nbackdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do\nnot convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires\na unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the\nsuspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost\nand the risk of detection.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box\nwatermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as\nthe ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight\nwe term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the\ndifference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two\nconnected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple\nselected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information\nwithout introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE\nis evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along\nwith state-of-the-art methods.

To address this pressing risk, we\npresent ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on\nLLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies\namong the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing\non this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential\nbackdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the\nagent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the\nagent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought\ntrajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and\nthe user's instruction.

This paper aims to overcome these limitations by\nproposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning\n(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into\nnumerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in\nsolving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network\ntraining, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme\nlearning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in\nPINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and\nfixed during the training process.

Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is\ndemonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems.

To address this issue,\nexisting approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative\nmodeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques\noriginally developed for image generation.

However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity\nconstraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been\ndeveloped to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex\nconstraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed\nconstraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of\nconvergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in\nsparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of\nsparse optimization with extra \\qw{\\textit{support-preserving}} constraints\ncommonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative\nhard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection\noperator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple\nalternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint.

This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited\nsupervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the\ndifficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which\narises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,\nwe introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges.

Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic\nsimilarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups\nfeatures at different granularities and aggregates these results.

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This\nis because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible\ndue to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy\nconstraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework\nthat quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the\ntraining data by solving a binary classification task.
