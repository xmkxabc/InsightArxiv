A key\ncontribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic\npaths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path\ngeometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension\nincreases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic\nself-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the\nentropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation\ntrials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,\nachieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible\nentropy deviation.

In this work, we investigate how transformers\nperform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,\n\\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly\nrelated items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs\n(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior\nacross two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models\nstore information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where\nmodels flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear\nregression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable\ntransitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \\textit{symbolic\ndistance} and \\textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal\nperformance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that\npre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of\nrepresentations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "本研究探讨了transformers在不同学习机制下的关系推理能力，发现预训练可以促进其表现。", "motivation": "研究旨在探究不同学习机制下transformers进行关系推理的能力，以及其背后的机制。", "method": "本研究通过比较两种不同的学习机制（IWL和ICL）来研究transformers在关系推理任务上的表现。", "result": "研究发现IWL模型在关系推理任务上表现出泛化偏差，而ICL模型则没有。此外，预训练可以促进transformers在关系推理任务上的表现。", "conclusion": "研究发现，尽管IWL模型仅对相邻项目进行训练，但它自然地诱导了对关系推理的泛化偏差，而ICL模型则没有。此外，当transformers在上下文线性回归任务上进行预训练时，它们能够成功地表现出上下文可泛化的关系推理。"}}

VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines.

Despite\nadvancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique\nchallenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of\nlarge-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with\nreal-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown\npromise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have\ndemonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document\nunderstanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges\nsuch as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency\npersist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in\nVietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how\nLLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,\nincluding dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of\nmultimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these\ngaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage\ncommunity-driven solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "本研究综述了越南文档识别技术，探讨了LLMs的潜力及其在文档智能方面的应用。", "motivation": "越南文本识别面临独特挑战，如复杂的音调、声调和缺乏大规模标注数据集。", "method": "通过综述现有技术、强调关键限制并探索如何利用LLMs改变该领域，本研究提供了对越南文档识别技术的全面回顾。", "result": "大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型在文本识别和文档理解方面取得了显著进步，为越南文档分析识别提供了新的方向。", "conclusion": "通过解决领域适应、多模态学习和计算效率等问题，我们旨在促进越南文档分析识别的进步并鼓励社区驱动的解决方案。"}}
