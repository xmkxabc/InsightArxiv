We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental\nawareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles\nahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure\nclearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from\nthe user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring\nunnatural movement patterns.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively.

We further propose\nto use foundation model-generated depth images as intermediate representation\nensuring robustness across a variety of input domains establishing models with\nsubstantially less reliance on individual training datasets. Moreover our\nintermediate depth image representation allows to easily construct paired image\ndata for training. Our experiments showed that input images from different\ndomains (e.g. virtual bronchoscopy, phantoms) can be successfully translated to\nimages mimicking realistic human airway appearance. We demonstrated that\nanatomical settings (i.e. bronchial orifices) can be robustly preserved with\nour approach which is shown qualitatively and quantitatively by means of\nimproved FID, SSIM and dice coefficients scores. Our anatomical constraints\nenabled an improvement in the Dice coefficient of up to 0.43 for synthetic\nimages. Through foundation models for intermediate depth representations,\nbronchial orifice segmentation integrated as anatomical constraints into\nconditional GANs we are able to robustly translate images from different\nbronchoscopy input domains. BronchoGAN allows to incorporate public CT scan\ndata (virtual bronchoscopy) in order to generate large-scale bronchoscopy image\ndatasets with realistic appearance. BronchoGAN enables to bridge the gap of\nmissing public bronchoscopy images.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01387v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "cate": "eess.IV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01387v1", "date": "2025-07-02", "updated": "2025-07-02"}

Drawing on Misesian a priori\nreasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems\nare incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination:\ninterpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value\nthrough prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as\noptimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under\nuncertainty.\n  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability,\nand Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which\nconflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights.\nAttempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of\nethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms,\ninterpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned,\nand inert.\n  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance\ndegrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft\ntotalitarianism.

Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews.

While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted\nfour-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this\napproach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications.

GuideSep is\nconditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be\neasily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram\ndomain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior\napproaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning\nscheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and\napplicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the\nsame model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative\napproaches.

A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case.

Building\non this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a\nmodel featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the\nComposer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling\nthe role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq\narchitectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual\ninformation and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens\ndecoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE\ngenerates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art models. Furthermore, pretraining the Composer branch on extra\nmusical score datasets contribute to a significant performance gain.", "comment": "Accepted by IEEE SMC 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01582v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.AI", "cs.MM", "eess.AS"], "cate": "cs.SD", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01582v1", "date": "2025-07-02", "updated": "2025-07-02"}

Most existing studies focus on\nimage-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing\nless emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level\nmultiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane\nlocalization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.\nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts\nmodule (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,\nwe propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align\nimage features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token\nselection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype\nlearning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal\nabdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748\nimages and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors.

Traditional control techniques often rely on\nprecise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external\nperturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based\nexpert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator\nfailures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous\nresults in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner\npolicy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs\nand improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary\nexperiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert\ncan rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna\norientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally,\nthe GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories\ngenerated by the SAC expert.

Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs\ndistilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they\nachieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and\n3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and\nGSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform\na quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more\nclosely aligned with base SLM distributions.

A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that\ncan converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy\nentropy and value distribution function.

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context.

The early studies relied heavily on CNNs\nbut latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that\ndeliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges\nlike imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited\ngeneralizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles.\nOverall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights\nuseful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for\nAI-based pest monitoring systems.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01494v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01494v1", "date": "2025-07-02", "updated": "2025-07-02"}

Existing approaches\ntypically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this\nwork, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)\nframework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses\nare equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,\ngrounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse\nspectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this\nnew paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising\naligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference\ncamera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves\nconsistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.\nIn a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra\ncompared to an ordinary RGB camera.

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong\ntheoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to\ndata poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates\non top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement\nsuitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in\naddition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we\ndemonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing\nhow a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a\nbenchmark of reasoning datasets.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel\nmetrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample\ncontributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our\nmetrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.\nThrough analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear\nscore degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases.

In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data.

This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of\nDNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the\nfirst time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and\nface landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained\nwith large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our\nmodels, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack\ncases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function\nof a system.

The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and\nalignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct\nabnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged.

To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process.

This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in\nthe internal representational structure of the model, and that specific\nattention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over\nthe other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic \"router heads\" which appear to\npromote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can\nbe manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets\nand modalities.
