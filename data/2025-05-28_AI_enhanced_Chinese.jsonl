Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that\nconform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires\nclear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex\nlanguage instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we\npropose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT).\nReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about\nobjects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and\ntracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the\nreasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a\nreasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets.\nSpecifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning\ncharacteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is\ndivided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a\nset of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose\nReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking\nbased on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the\nReaMOT task.

Activation steering provides an alternative for\ninference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained,\nadaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight,\ntrainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller\nnetwork observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a\nglobal scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling\nfactor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a\nsteering patch, derived from a pre-computed \"refusal direction\" vector, applied\nacross the LLM's layers during generation.

Since rendering integrals often\ncomprise products of lower-dimensional integrals, recent work has focused on\ndeveloping sequences that are also well-distributed in lower-dimensional\nprojections. To this end, we introduce a novel construction of binary-based (0,\n4)-sequences; that is, progressive fully multi-stratified sequences of 4D\npoints, and extend the idea to higher power-of-two dimensions. We further show\nthat not only it is possible to nest lower-dimensional sequences in\nhigher-dimensional ones -- for example, embedding a (0, 2)-sequence within our\n(0, 4)-sequence -- but that we can ensemble two (0, 2)-sequences into a (0,\n4)-sequence, four (0, 4)-sequences into a (0, 16)-sequence, and so on. Such\nsequences can provide excellent convergence rates when integrals include\nlower-dimensional integration problems in 2, 4, 16, ... dimensions. Our\nconstruction is based on using 2$\\times$2 block matrices as symbols to\nconstruct larger matrices that potentially generate a sequence with the target\n(0, s)-sequence in base $s$ property. We describe how to search for suitable\nalphabets and identify two distinct, cross-related alphabets of block symbols,\nwhich we call S and Z, hence \\emph{SZ} for the resulting family of sequences.\nGiven the alphabets, we construct candidate generator matrices and search for\nvalid sets of matrices. We then infer a formula to construct full-resolution\n(64-bit) matrices. Our binayr generator matrices allow highly efficient\nimplementation using bitwise operations, and can be used as a drop-in\nreplacement for Sobol matrices in existing applications.

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background\nediting and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we\nintroduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a\nsingle pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather\neffects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View\n(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal\nand spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and\nmulti-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a\n3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field\nto generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and\ndynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based\nmodelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and\nflexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with\nthe 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.\nExperiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can\ngenerate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,\nhighlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse\nweather.

Building on this insight,\nwe introduce Progressively Projected Newton (PPN), a novel variant of Newton's\nMethod that uses the current iterate residual to cheaply determine the subset\nof element Hessians to project. The global Hessian thus remains closer to its\noriginal form, reducing both the number of Newton iterations and the amount of\nrequired eigen-decompositions.\n  We compare PPN with PN and Project-on-Demand Newton (PDN) in a comprehensive\nset of experiments covering contact-free and contact-rich deformables\n(including large stiffness and mass ratios), co-dimensional, and rigid-body\nsimulations, and a range of time step sizes, tolerances and resolutions. PPN\nconsistently performs fewer than 10% of the projections required by PN or PDN\nand, in the vast majority of cases, converges in fewer Newton iterations, which\nmakes PPN the fastest solver in our benchmark.

The core challenges are\ntwofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight\ncoordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are\ninterdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation\ntypically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often\nrequiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable\nparts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion\nnoise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization\nover three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right\nhand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization.\nCoordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic\nchain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion\nobjectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object\ninteraction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS),\nwhere end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for\nobject geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial\nrelationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting\ntrajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise,\nproducing highly accurate interaction motion.

Recently, the Mamba model has\nsubstantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding\nperformance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM).\nHowever, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D\njoint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution\nstructure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in\nthis paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction\nand length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing\neffective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint\nsequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba\nmodel by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling\nit to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a\nSpatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial\nrelationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal\ntopology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing\nhuman structural relationships.

Our\nanalyses (metric-based comparisons and \"LLM-as-judge\" evaluation) suggest that\nthere is no significant bias in LLM responses for men and women at a category\nlevel. However, at a finer granularity (the individual question level), there\nare substantial differences in LLM responses for men and women in the majority\nof cases, which \"cancel\" each other out often due to some responses being\nbetter for males and vice versa.

We suggest a simple\ndebiasing approach that iteratively merges the responses for the two genders to\nproduce a final result. Our approach demonstrates that a simple, prompt-based\ndebiasing strategy can effectively debias LLM outputs, thus producing responses\nwith higher information content than both gendered variants in 78% of the\ncases, and consistently achieving a balanced integration in the remaining\ncases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u9762\u4e0aLLM\u5bf9\u7537\u5973\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6d41\u884c\u7684LLM\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6RealWorldQuestioning\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u4e2aLLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u71b5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ChatGPT-4o\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u9762\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u5c42\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u572878%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861LLM\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This study introduces a novel deep learning\napproach that integrates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based transfer\nlearning to enhance prediction accuracy. We are the first to incorporate all\npolysomnography signals together for hypertension prediction, leveraging their\ncollective information to improve model performance. Features were extracted\nfrom these signals and transformed into a 2D representation to utilize\npre-trained 2D neural networks such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet\nvariants. To further improve feature learning, we introduced a DCT layer, which\ntransforms input features into a frequency-based representation, preserving\nessential spectral information, decorrelating features, and enhancing\nrobustness to noise. This frequency-domain approach, coupled with transfer\nlearning, is especially beneficial for limited medical datasets, as it\nleverages rich representations from pre-trained networks to improve\ngeneralization.

However, since style and appearance are often entangled, the\nexisting methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while\nadhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent\ntext-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated\nimage sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across\nprompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile,\ntraining-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across\ndifferent styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that\nachieves both style alignment and subject consistency. The attention matrices\nare manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor\nimage(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported\nfrom a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored.

Existing vision-based\nmethods perform well on daytime benchmarks but struggle in nighttime scenarios\ndue to limited visibility and challenging lighting conditions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose \\textbf{LIAR}, a novel framework that learns\nillumination-affined representations. LIAR first introduces Selective Low-light\nImage Enhancement (SLLIE), which leverages the illumination priors from daytime\nscenes to adaptively determine whether a nighttime image is genuinely dark or\nsufficiently well-lit, enabling more targeted global enhancement. Building on\nthe illumination maps generated by SLLIE, LIAR further incorporates two\nillumination-aware components: 2D Illumination-guided Sampling (2D-IGS) and 3D\nIllumination-driven Projection (3D-IDP), to respectively tackle local\nunderexposure and overexposure. Specifically, 2D-IGS modulates feature sampling\npositions according to illumination maps, assigning larger offsets to darker\nregions and smaller ones to brighter regions, thereby alleviating feature\ndegradation in underexposed areas.

Content analysis of\nposts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual\nutterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the\nsame conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the\nconversational context and dependencies between different parts of a\nconversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and\ncomments/replies into the language model.\n  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate\nconversational context for various aspects about an online post in a\nconversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or\nfunny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which\nexplore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing\nthe conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that\nis appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to\nconversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly\ndifferent labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore\nprovides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as\nConversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to\ndisparately different conversation understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff08Conversation Kernels\uff09\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3001\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba8\u8bba\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5e16\u5b50\u7b80\u77ed\u4e14\u9690\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdConversation Kernels\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6811\u4e2d\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728slashdot.org\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Conversation Kernels\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The powerful generalization ability of\npre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training\n(CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized\ntasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight,\nincremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built\nupon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt\npools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that\nintroduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's\nintrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for\nCLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal\nstructure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual\nPrototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely\nas static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide\nthe learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e.,\nTPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more\neffective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close\nthe vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual\nprompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity\nregularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and\nmitigate correlated forgetting.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF with BERT embeddings,\neffectively transforming Spanish text into rich numerical representations that\npreserve the semantic depth of the original language by using a Custom Stacking\nEnsemble (CSE) approach. To evaluate emotion classification, we utilize a range\nof models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Bagging classifier with LGBM,\nand AdaBoost. The CSE model combines these classifiers as base models and uses\na one-vs-all Logistic Regression as the meta-model. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that CSE significantly outperforms the individual and BERT model,\nachieving a test accuracy of 93.3% on the native Spanish dataset--higher than\nthe accuracy obtained from the translated version.

In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for\na specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient\ncontextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.\nHowever, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of\nselecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant\nschema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM\nunderstand domain-specific nuances. Retrieval-based methods have become the\ngo-to approach for identifying such context. While effective, these methods\nintroduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.\n  In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision,\nhigh-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL\ngeneration, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches. In such\nscenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the\nintricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution\nlatencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on\nsimilarity. The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative\nset of exemplars for a given production setting.

To\naddress these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose\nPLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation\ntokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find\nthat pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning\nsegmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM\nfinetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive\nwith segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data.

However, a critical challenge when applying RL to\nthese agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically\navailable only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to\nassign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance\nregarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,\nwe draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the\ncumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise\nProgress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that\ndecomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its\nincremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train\na progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory\nto match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the\nestimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in\nthe environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent\ntraining. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop,\nALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\\% on average) and grounding\naccuracy (+1.9\\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method\nremarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training.

To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet\neffective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or\narchitectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by\nprocessing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (a\nfork phase), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in\nthe remaining layers (a merge phase). This approach promotes balanced modality\ncontributions and leverages complementary information across modalities.

However, this\ncombined challenge-model compression and domain adaptation-remains largely\nunaddressed, as prior work has tackled each issue in isolation: compressed\nnetworks prioritize efficiency within a fixed domain, whereas large, capable\nmodels focus on handling domain shifts. In this work, we propose CoDA, a\nfrequency composition-based framework that unifies compression and domain\nadaptation. During training, CoDA employs quantization-aware training (QAT)\nwith low-frequency components, enabling a compressed model to selectively learn\nrobust, generalizable features. At test time, it refines the compact model in a\nsource-free manner (i.e., test-time adaptation, TTA), leveraging the\nfull-frequency information from incoming data to adapt to target domains while\ntreating high-frequency components as domain-specific cues. LFC are aligned\nwith the trained distribution, while HFC unique to the target distribution are\nsolely utilized for batch normalization.

Furthermore, we introduce\na cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject\nthem into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the\nreasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model.

First, we develop an RL\ntraining paradigm of reinforced informativeness optimization that directly\noptimizes informativeness and effectively addresses the slow-thinking deficit\nin conventional RAG systems, bypassing the need for expensive supervised data.\nSecond, we propose a nugget-centric hierarchical reward modeling approach that\nenables precise assessment of long-form answers through a three-stage process:\nextracting the nugget from every source webpage, constructing a nugget claim\nchecklist, and computing rewards based on factual alignment. Extensive\nexperiments on two LFQA benchmarks LongFact and RAGChecker demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

While\ncalibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the\nimpact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains\nunderstudied.

As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable\nLLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and\nperformance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission\n(LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training.\nLLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the\ninitial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a\nresponse using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the\nvalidity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively\nupgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates\nuntil a valid response is obtained.

When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and\napproach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately\nestimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based\nmethods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their\nperformance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies\non the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant\nerrors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust\npothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and\nmonocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First,\nto enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small\npotholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object\ndetection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking,\nwhile DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained\ndepth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel\n(MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter\nbased on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of\nestimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8\nmodel achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8.\nThrough CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become\nmore robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9053\u8def\u5751\u6d3c\u9762\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684ACSH-YOLOv8\u6a21\u578b\u548cMBTP\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9053\u8def\u5751\u6d3c\u5bf9\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8212\u9002\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u76f8\u673a\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u9762\u5e73\u5766\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACSH-YOLOv8\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5c0f\u5751\u6d3c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BoT-SORT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548cDepthAnything V2\u751f\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MBTP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5751\u6d3c\u9762\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CDKF\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "ACSH-YOLOv8\u7684AP(50)\u8fbe\u523076.6%\uff0c\u6bd4YOLOv8\u63d0\u53477.6%\uff1bCDKF\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5751\u6d3c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

First, there is a need for hierarchical\npersonalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used\nusers' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves\ninadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes\nare typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing\nthe likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text\ngeneration tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to\npublic relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is\ndetoxifying QAC systems.\n  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that\ncaptures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,\nincorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is\ncaptured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This\napproach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling\nonline generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an\nonline training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By\nincorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference\nprocesses, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the\ngenerated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given\nprefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and\nperform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric\nimprovement in nearly two years of our product.

Unlike VTON, which must\nresolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and\nwell-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation\nof the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset\nenhancement.

To address this, we propose a novel distributed\ninference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of\ngenerating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames\nand model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division\nfaces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise\nlevels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of\noriginal parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle\nthis. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with\nprogressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and\nlayer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling\nasynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we\nincorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on\neach GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context,\nminimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we\nemploy a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally\nconsistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs\nwithout extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and\ninfinitely long video generation.

Focusing on these issues, we\nfine-tune four VLMs using our dataset and achieve stable improvements across\nall tasks, with robust cross-sensor and cross-disaster generalization\ncapabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6DisasterM3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u707e\u5bb3\u3001\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u707e\u5bb3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDisasterM3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b26,988\u5f20\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c123k\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d65\u5927\u6d3236\u79cd\u707e\u5bb3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAR\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba19\u79cd\u707e\u5bb3\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3014\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u548c\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c034\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u8de8\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DisasterM3\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u707e\u5bb3\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss\nfunction, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries.\nExtensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the\nmutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the\neffectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset,\nNYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without\ndomain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the\ncompetitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric\nfidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support\nfuture research in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoDOT\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u906e\u6321\u8fb9\u754c\uff08OB\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CASM\u6a21\u5757\u548cOBDCL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u906e\u6321\u8fb9\u754c\uff08OB\uff09\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\u76f8\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoDOT\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CASM\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6761\u5e26\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u548cOBDCL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\u548cOB\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cNYUD-v2\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u548cOB\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cMoDOT\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

While the quantitative\nperformance between resolutions is comparable, high-resolution imagery provides\nsignificantly sharper segmentation boundaries and finer spatial detail.\n  As part of this work, we also contribute a curated Sentinel-2 dataset with\nDynamic World labels, tailored for wetland classification tasks and made\npublicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6e7f\u5730\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e7f\u5730\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528U-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8377\u5170\u516d\u4e2a\u6e7f\u5730\u533a\u57df\u7684Sentinel-2\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a85.26%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SSL\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u63d0\u9ad8\u523088.23%\u3002\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u6e7f\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Additionally, pose sequences often contain\nsignificant redundancy between frames. However, recent methods typically fail\nto improve model capacity while effectively eliminating sequence redundancy. In\nthis work, we introduce the Spectral Compression Transformer (SCT) to reduce\nsequence length and accelerate computation. The SCT encoder treats hidden\nfeatures between blocks as Temporal Feature Signals (TFS) and applies the\nDiscrete Cosine Transform, a Fourier transform-based technique, to determine\nthe spectral components to be retained. By filtering out certain high-frequency\nnoise components, SCT compresses the sequence length and reduces redundancy. To\nfurther enrich the input sequence with prior structural information, we propose\nthe Line Pose Graph (LPG) based on line graph theory.

However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop\nmapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the\nmulti-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information\nby focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present\nAgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed\nfor agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the\nnecessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction,\nleading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture\nwhere temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations.\nThis modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series\nsatellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three\nsatellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is\npre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image\nsamples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates\na versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned\nspatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks.\nComprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over\nconventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose\nRSFMs across all downstream tasks.

However, existing video benchmarks primarily\nevaluate visual perception and grounding abilities, with questions that can be\nanswered based on explicit prompts or isolated visual cues. Such benchmarks do\nnot fully capture the intricacies of real-world reasoning, where humans must\nactively search for, integrate, and analyze multiple clues before reaching a\nconclusion. To address this issue, we present Video-Holmes, a benchmark\ninspired by the reasoning process of Sherlock Holmes, designed to evaluate the\ncomplex video reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Video-Holmes consists of 1,837\nquestions derived from 270 manually annotated suspense short films, which spans\nseven carefully designed tasks. Each task is constructed by first identifying\nkey events and causal relationships within films, and then designing questions\nthat require models to actively locate and connect multiple relevant visual\nclues scattered across different video segments. Our comprehensive evaluation\nof state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that, while these models generally excel at\nvisual perception, they encounter substantial difficulties with integrating\ninformation and often miss critical clues.

However, existing methods often rely on\nreference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to\nidentity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content.\nIn addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues,\nlip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this\npaper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for\ndiverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm\nusing Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit\nmasks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial\ndynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a\nflow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and\nidentity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address\nthe weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal\nClassifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance\nstrength over time and space.

It is a critical component of efficient perception and\ndecision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and\ndecision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.\nHowever, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,\nthere is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn\nactive perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic\ndefinition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the\nrecently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a\nspecial case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search\nefficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose\nACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on\ntop of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We\nfurther establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across\nboth general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,\nand domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote\nsensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive\nsegmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot\nreasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit\nreasoning data.

However, it is commonly observed that some experts are\nactivated far more often than others, leading to system inefficiency when\nrunning the experts on different devices in parallel. Therefore, we introduce\nMixture of Grouped Experts (MoGE), which groups the experts during selection\nand balances the expert workload better than MoE in nature.

To address this limitation, we propose a\ntargeted transferable adversarial attack method based on feature optimal\nalignment, called FOA-Attack, to improve adversarial transfer capability.\nSpecifically, at the global level, we introduce a global feature loss based on\ncosine similarity to align the coarse-grained features of adversarial samples\nwith those of target samples.

Building on this benchmark, we propose\nPosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser\ndistills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns\ntext-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and\nspatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by\nexecuting rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and\nensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o\noutputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and\npoor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary\naesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual\nsemantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the\nQwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across\nnearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens.

However, recent work has identified the emergence\nof artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These\nanomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained\nlocalization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is\nto the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly \"absorb\" the\nartifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale\npre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register\ntokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible\nconsidering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg),\nan efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an\nexisting ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining.\nPH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained\nViT.

While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been\nwidely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs),\nextending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies\nin videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate\ndifferent frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information.

To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of\nPosition Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs.\nHoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic\nmodeling over arbitrarily long context, and a dynamic temporal scaling\nmechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse\ncontext lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long\nvideo understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently\noutperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness.

However, despite their creative potential, T2I\nmodels often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those\nrelated to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.\nThis paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social\nStereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.\nWe audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and\nStability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural,\noccupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are\nprone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions,\ncultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our\nrubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly\nreduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and\n51% for adjectival queries.

LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent\nresponses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system\nprompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts\nwithout visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation\nremains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex,\nthey can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This\nlack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of\ninformation in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work\nexamines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end,\nwe compare how models process demographic information in system versus user\nprompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our\nanalysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user\nrepresentation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from\ninaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk\nrepresentational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms\nbeyond the user's ability to detect or correct.

Subsequently, we decompose each based template into\nmultiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final\nrefinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of\nsynthesis.

We investigated whether artificial\nintelligence (AI) interpretation of micro-US can outperform clinical screening\nmethods using PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE). Methods: We\nretrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with\ncsPCa, 66 without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was used to\nextract deep image features from 2D micro-US slices. Random forest classifiers\nwere trained using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice\nlevel. Patients were classified as csPCa-positive if 88 or more consecutive\nslices were predicted positive. Model performance was compared with a\nclassifier using PSA, DRE, prostate volume, and age. Key findings and\nlimitations: The AI-based micro-US model and clinical screening model achieved\nAUROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. At a fixed threshold, the micro-US\nmodel achieved 92.5% sensitivity and 68.1% specificity, while the clinical\nmodel showed 96.2% sensitivity but only 27.3% specificity. Limitations include\na retrospective single-center design and lack of external validation.\nConclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US improves\nspecificity while maintaining high sensitivity for csPCa detection. This method\nmay reduce unnecessary biopsies and serve as a low-cost alternative to\nPSA-based screening. Patient summary: We developed an AI system to analyze\nprostate micro-ultrasound images.
