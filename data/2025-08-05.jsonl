As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type.

Further analyses suggest two additional insights:\n(1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making\nper-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision\narithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify\nMicrosoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we\ndesign Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared\nbetween two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a\nState-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers\nand adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of\nstate update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to\nLLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 4.1x and 2.1x\nhigher token generation throughput, respectively.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10178v2", "cate": "cs.AR", "date": "2025-07-14", "updated": "2025-08-04"}

Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be\ndifferent approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the\nproblem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise.

For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic\npeeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls\nbelow a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to\ntransform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small\nadditive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph\nsetting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to\ncomposition, as SVT is applied to every vertex.

Furthermore, we propose two factors targeting the\nstructure of the given context-free language: nesting of constructs and\ninsertion of multiplicities.\n  We conducted a controlled experiment using within-subject randomization in an\ninteractive learning system, testing the proposed difficulty factors for\nconstructing context-free grammars and pushdown automata. Our results suggest\nthat three of the four factors significantly influence students' objective\nperformance in solving exercises for constructing context-free grammars, while\nstudents' perceived difficulties only partly align with the objective\nperformance measures. The findings for pushdown automata tasks differed\nmarkedly from those for context-free grammar tasks. Our variations either had\nnegligible effects or, in some cases, even reduced difficulty. Thus, no robust\nstatistical conclusions can be made for pushdown automata tasks.\n  The results lay foundations for learning systems that adaptively choose\nappropriate exercises for individual students.", "comment": "To be presented at ACM Conference on International Computing\n  Education Research V.1 (ICER 2025 Vol. 1), August 3--6, 2025,\n  Charlottesville, VA, USA", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01735v1", "cate": "cs.CY", "date": "2025-08-03", "updated": "2025-08-03"}

We introduce LZ-Start-End (LZSE), a\nnew variant of LZ-like factorizations in which each copy factor refers to a\ncontiguous sequence of preceding factors. By its nature, any context-free\ngrammar can easily be converted into an LZSE factorization of equal size.\nFurther, we study the greedy LZSE factorization, in which each copy factor is\ntaken as long as possible. We show how the greedy LZSE factorization can be\ncomputed in linear time with respect to the input string length, and that there\nexists a family of strings for which the size of the greedy LZSE factorization\nis of strictly lower order than that of the smallest grammar. These imply that\nour LZSE scheme is stronger than grammar-based compressions in the context of\nrepetitiveness measures. To support fast queries, we propose a data structure\nfor LZSE-compressed strings that permits $O(\\log n)$-time random access within\nspace linear in the compressed size, where $n$ is the length of the input\nstring.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20107v2", "cate": "cs.DS", "date": "2025-06-25", "updated": "2025-08-03"}

To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified\n3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.\nThus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate\nsystem defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a\ncollision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further\nrefine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth\nnoting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables\nthe reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our\nexperiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D\nclothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to\ncategory-specific methods.

Recently, there has\nbeen rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed\ngraphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed\nedges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One\nreason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network\nusing real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed\nphylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it\ninduces on the 4-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are\ncalled quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-2 phylogenetic\nnetworks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for\nlevel-3. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a semi-directed\nbinary network, a tree that give the coarse-grained structure of the network,\nis always encoded by the quarnets of the network.

However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods\nhave convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we\nconduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing\ndatasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to\nenable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by\nautomatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that\nthese methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model\nlevels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human\nevaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is\ncomplex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not\ncurrently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human\nevaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future\nevaluations of LLM misgendering.

However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full\nfine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the\noriginal training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and\nstorage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but\nsome rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain\nset, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this\npaper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet\neffective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU\nemploys gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of\nunlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.\nThis adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while\nmaintaining model utility.

In contrast, our focus\nlies in conducting background adversarial attacks in both digital and physical\ndomains, without causing any disruptions to the targeted objects themselves.\nSpecifically, an effective background adversarial attack framework is proposed\nto attack anything, by which the attack efficacy generalizes well between\ndiverse objects, models, and tasks. Technically, we approach the background\nadversarial attack as an iterative optimization problem, analogous to the\nprocess of DNN learning. Besides, we offer a theoretical demonstration of its\nconvergence under a set of mild but sufficient conditions. To strengthen the\nattack efficacy and transferability, we propose a new ensemble strategy\ntailored for adversarial perturbations and introduce an improved smooth\nconstraint for the seamless connection of integrated perturbations. We conduct\ncomprehensive and rigorous experiments in both digital and physical domains\nacross various objects, models, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nattacking anything of the proposed method. The findings of this research\nsubstantiate the significant discrepancy between human and machine vision on\nthe value of background variations, which play a far more critical role than\npreviously recognized, necessitating a reevaluation of the robustness and\nreliability of DNNs.

Multi-modal selection calculates the\nacoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical\ncontext and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider\nboth similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the\nInterspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge\ndataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and\nequipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system\ntrained on 179K hours of data.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01166v1", "cate": "cs.SD", "date": "2025-08-02", "updated": "2025-08-02"}

Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less\nrelevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when\ncritical information is lost.

Our\napproach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at\nthe beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for\nnext-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly\nredundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \\textsc{PoD}\npreserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it\nshares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both\nqueries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single\nset of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without\ndiscarding essential context.

Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile.

Seminal\nattention-based models like TGAT and DyGFormer rely on sinusoidal time encoders\nto capture temporal dependencies between edge events. Prior work justified\nsinusoidal encodings because their inner products depend on the time spans\nbetween events, which are crucial features for modeling inter-event relations.\nHowever, sinusoidal encodings inherently lose temporal information due to their\nmany-to-one nature and therefore require high dimensions. In this paper, we\nrigorously study a simpler alternative: the linear time encoder, which avoids\ntemporal information loss caused by sinusoidal functions and reduces the need\nfor high-dimensional time encoders. We show that the self-attention mechanism\ncan effectively learn to compute time spans between events from linear time\nencodings and extract relevant temporal patterns. Through extensive experiments\non six dynamic graph datasets, we demonstrate that the linear time encoder\nimproves the performance of TGAT and DyGFormer in most cases.

For example, compared to a 100-dimensional sinusoidal\ntime encoder, TGAT with a 2-dimensional linear time encoder saves 43% of\nparameters and achieves higher average precision on five datasets.

To this end, we start by collecting noisy\ndata from the system through a finite-time experiment, referred to as a single\ntrajectory.

To enhance physical realism and safety, we\nintegrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement\nlearning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while\navoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on\nthe Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in\nmotion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes the\nFlexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for\nneural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance\ndegradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,\nwhich is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,\nFAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model\nperformance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures\ndifferences between unimportant units and those that cause performance\ndegradation.

This paper tackles the problem of identifying\nCSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the model is unknown and only\nlimited simulation data is accessible. Traditionally, a CSIS is defined as a\nsubset of a safe set, encompassing initial states for which a control input\nexists that keeps the system within the set at the next time step-this is\nreferred to as the one-step invariance property. However, the requirement for\none-step invariance can be equivalently translated into a stricter condition of\n``always-invariance'', meaning that there exist control inputs capable of\nkeeping the system within this set indefinitely. Such a condition may prove\noverly stringent or impractical for black-box systems, where predictions can\nbecome unreliable beyond a single time step or a limited number of finite time\nsteps. To overcome the challenges posed by black-box systems, we reformulate\nthe one-step invariance property in a ``Probably Approximately Correct'' (PAC)\nsense. This approach allows us to assess the probability that a control input\nexists to keep the system within the CSIS at the next time step, with a\npredefined level of confidence. If the system successfully remains within the\nset at the next time step, we can then reapply the invariance evaluation to the\nnew state, thereby facilitating a recursive assurance of invariance. Our method\nemploys barrier functions and scenario optimization, resulting in a linear\nprogramming method to estimate PAC CSISs.

A central objective among health researchers across disciplines\nis to identify modifiable factors that can reduce health disparities. Three\ncommon methods--difference-in-coefficients (DIC), Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder\n(KOB), and causal decomposition analysis (CDA)--share the same goal to identify\nsuch contributors but can produce divergent results depending on confounding\nand model assumptions. Despite these challenges, applied researchers lack clear\nguidance on selecting appropriate methods for different scenarios. Methods. We\nstart with a brief review of each method, assuming no unmeasured confounders.\nWe then move to two more realistic scenarios: 1) unmeasured confounders affect\nthe relationship between intermediate confounders and the mediator, and 2)\nunmeasured confounders affect the relationship between the mediator and the\noutcome. For each scenario, we generate simulated data, apply all three\nmethods, compare their estimates, and interpret the results using Directed\nAcyclic Graphs. Results. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, the\nDIC approach is a simplistic method suitable only when no intermediate\nconfounders are present. The KOB decomposition is appropriate unless adjustment\nfor baseline covariates is necessary. When unmeasured confounding exists, the\nDIC method yields biased estimates in both scenarios, and all three methods\nproduce biased results in the second scenario. However, CDA, when paired with\nsensitivity analysis can help assess the robustness of its estimates.\nConclusions. We advise against using the DIC method, particularly, in\nobservational studies, as the assumptions of no intermediate confounders is\noften unrealistic.

This difficulty stems not merely\nfrom complex data distributions or noisy labels, but from a deeper\nrepresentational bottleneck: the inherent struggle of generic neural networks\nto implicitly learn abstract, non-associative functions like parity, which are\ncrucial for optimal play in impartial games. This limitation causes a critical\nbreakdown in the positive feedback loop essential for self-play RL, preventing\neffective learning beyond rote memorization of frequently observed states.\nThese results align with broader concerns regarding AlphaZero-style algorithms'\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks, highlighting their inability to truly\nmaster all legal game states.

A\nshared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),\nsupervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label\nreliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty\nestimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student\nduring training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score\nimprovements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and\n0.7% and 1.4% at 10%.

We find that existing\nFourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series\nlength issues.
