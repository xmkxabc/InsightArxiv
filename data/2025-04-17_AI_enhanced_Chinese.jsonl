To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes an efficient model, Small Object Detection\nTransformer (SO-DETR).

This\npaper introduces snnTrans-DHZ, a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN)\nspecifically designed for underwater dehazing. By leveraging the temporal\ndynamics of SNNs, snnTrans-DHZ efficiently processes time-dependent raw image\nsequences while maintaining low power consumption. Static underwater images are\nfirst converted into time-dependent sequences by repeatedly inputting the same\nimage over user-defined timesteps. These RGB sequences are then transformed\ninto LAB color space representations and processed concurrently. The\narchitecture features three key modules: (i) a K estimator that extracts\nfeatures from multiple color space representations; (ii) a Background Light\nEstimator that jointly infers the background light component from the RGB-LAB\nimages; and (iii) a soft image reconstruction module that produces haze-free,\nvisibility-enhanced outputs. The snnTrans-DHZ model is directly trained using a\nsurrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) strategy alongside\na novel combined loss function. Evaluated on the UIEB benchmark, snnTrans-DHZ\nachieves a PSNR of 21.68 dB and an SSIM of 0.8795, and on the EUVP dataset, it\nyields a PSNR of 23.46 dB and an SSIM of 0.8439.

While previous studies have examined whether\nmodels can reflect individual opinions or attitudes, we argue that a\n\\emph{higher-order} binding of virtual personas requires successfully\napproximating not only the opinions of a user as an identified member of a\ngroup, but also the nuanced ways in which that user perceives and evaluates\nthose outside the group. In particular, faithfully simulating how humans\nperceive different social groups is critical for applying LLMs to various\npolitical science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics,\ninter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding.

To address this important gap, this paper introduces\nDamageCAT, a novel framework that provides typology-based categorical damage\ndescriptions rather than simple severity ratings. Accordingly, this study\npresents two key contributions: (1) the BD-TypoSAT dataset containing satellite\nimage triplets (pre-disaster, post-disaster, and damage masks) from Hurricane\nIda with four damage categories (partial roof damage, total roof damage,\npartial structural collapse, and total structural collapse), and (2) a\nhierarchical U-Net-based transformer architecture that effectively processes\npre-post disaster image pairs to identify and categorize building damage.\nDespite significant class imbalances in the training data, our model achieved\nrobust performance with overall metrics of 0.7921 Intersection over Union (IoU)\nand 0.8835 F1 scores across all categories.

How are language and\nimages organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and\nmodality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\non the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,\nand AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of\nlearned directions, or \"concepts\". We find that, compared to other methods of\nlinear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,\nwhile also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different\nseeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts\ncaptured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that\nthe key commonly-activating concepts extracted by SAEs are remarkably stable\nacross runs. Interestingly, while most concepts are strongly unimodal in\nactivation, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many lie\nclose to - but not entirely within - the subspace defining modality, suggesting\nthat they encode cross-modal semantics despite their unimodal usage. To\nquantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that\nidentifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text\ninputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space.

While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more\ndifficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe\nno bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both\nthe QA and judgment tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30QA\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfEM/F1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfEM\u548cF1\u8bc4\u5206\u672a\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349QA\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff080.85\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eEM\uff080.17\uff09\u548cF1\uff080.36\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7b54\u6848\u7c7b\u578b\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Extensive research in making\nT2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as\ngenerating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society.\nTo help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for\nusers features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these\nmodels. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to\nprevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities\ncan easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing\nconcern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities.\nMoreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes\nboth prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples. This work proposes a\nmillion-scale prompt and image dataset generated using open-source diffusion\nmodels. Second, we develop a multimodal defense to distinguish safe and NSFW\ntext and images, which is robust against adversarial attacks and directly\nalleviates current challenges. Our extensive experiments show that our model\nperforms well against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy\nand recall, drastically reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal\nadversarial attack scenarios.

To boost the utility of\nlabeled data, we identify the variability among performers and the commonality\nwithin each action as two key attributes. We present SkeletonX, a lightweight\ntraining pipeline that integrates seamlessly with existing GCN-based skeleton\naction recognizers, promoting effective training under limited labeled data.\nFirst, we propose a tailored sample pair construction strategy on two key\nattributes to form and aggregate sample pairs. Next, we develop a concise and\neffective feature aggregation module to process these pairs. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD with various\nGCN backbones, demonstrating that the pipeline effectively improves performance\nwhen trained from scratch with limited data. Moreover, it surpasses previous\nstate-of-the-art methods in the one-shot setting, with only 1/10 of the\nparameters and much fewer FLOPs.

However, existing approaches prompt the\n\\textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\\textit{verbalized\nconfidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations. Inspired\nby a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called\n\\textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box\nLLMs. This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement\nand 3) evaluation. In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate\nanswers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of\nconfidence. This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for\nthe LLM to generate as in previous approaches. We use various prompting\ntechniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of\nrandomness in the generation process. In the refinement phase, answers from the\nprevious phase are refined to generate better answers. The LLM answers are\nevaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal\nworkings. This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM\noverprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2)\n{\\color{blue}there is no correlation between the length of the interval and the\nimposed confidence level, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of\nunderstanding of the concept of confidence or b) inability to adjust\nself-confidence by following instructions}, {\\color{blue}3)} LLM numerical\nprecision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and prompting\ntechnique {\\color{blue}4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in\nmost cases}.

Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a promising\napproach for efficient garment simulation. However, GNNs require extensive\nmessage-passing to propagate information such as physical forces and maintain\ncontact awareness across the entire garment mesh, which becomes computationally\ninefficient at higher resolutions. To address this, we devise a novel GNN-based\nmesh learning framework with two key components to extend the message-passing\nrange with minimal overhead, namely the Laplacian-Smoothed Dual Message-Passing\n(LSDMP) and the Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) modules. LSDMP enhances\nmessage-passing with a Laplacian features smoothing process, which efficiently\npropagates the impact of each vertex to nearby vertices.

We address the task of concept erasure in\ndiffusion models, i.e., removing a specified concept from a pre-trained model\nsuch that prompting the concept (or related synonyms) no longer yields its\ndepiction, while preserving the model's ability to generate other content. We\npropose a novel method, Attentional Concept Erasure (ACE), that integrates a\nclosed-form attention manipulation with lightweight fine-tuning. Theoretically,\nwe formulate concept erasure as aligning the model's conditional distribution\non the target concept with a neutral distribution. Our approach identifies and\nnullifies concept-specific latent directions in the cross-attention modules via\na gated low-rank adaptation, followed by adversarially augmented fine-tuning to\nensure thorough erasure of the concept and its synonyms.

While existing approaches typically\nemploy multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities\nfor prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated\nprompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass\nstate-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD\nscenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential\ncomponents: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and\ndiscriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support\naugmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to\naddress the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature\nintegration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency\nlocal details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual\nmemory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive\nevaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate\nVisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our\nmethod achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8%\nrespectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant\nmargins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%).

At test time, the model applies an approximate inverse\nto real dysarthric inputs. Despite zero-shot generalization, we observe\nsubstantial ASR gains, including up to 16 percentage points WER reduction on\nchallenging TORGO samples, with no degradation on clean speech.

While these semantic relations\nbear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently,\nrequiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could\nconstitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful\nrepresentations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus\nfar, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue\nthat the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be\nachieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD)\nand the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take\nadvantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are\nconstructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints\ninto account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on\nobject interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior\nin a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary\nRegularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance\nsegmentation in a single shot.

This setting, known as one-shot segmentation in few-shot\nlearning, explores the segmentation model's generalization ability and has been\napplied to various vision tasks, including scene understanding and image/video\nediting. While recent Segment Anything Models have achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in interactive segmentation, these approaches are not directly\napplicable to in-context segmentation. In this work, we propose the Dual\nConsistency SAM (DC-SAM) method based on prompt-tuning to adapt SAM and SAM2\nfor in-context segmentation of both images and videos. Our key insights are to\nenhance the features of the SAM's prompt encoder in segmentation by providing\nhigh-quality visual prompts. When generating a mask prior, we fuse the SAM\nfeatures to better align the prompt encoder. Then, we design a cycle-consistent\ncross-attention on fused features and initial visual prompts. Next, a\ndual-branch design is provided by using the discriminative positive and\nnegative prompts in the prompt encoder. Furthermore, we design a simple\nmask-tube training strategy to adopt our proposed dual consistency method into\nthe mask tube. Although the proposed DC-SAM is primarily designed for images,\nit can be seamlessly extended to the video domain with the support of SAM2.\nGiven the absence of in-context segmentation in the video domain, we manually\ncurate and construct the first benchmark from existing video segmentation\ndatasets, named In-Context Video Object Segmentation (IC-VOS), to better assess\nthe in-context capability of the model.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation\nmethod that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales. Our approach leverages\nan anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to\nseparate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field\ndepth and tapered far-field depth. The anchor acts as a normalization factor,\nenabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while\nmapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero. Through this approach, any depth\nfrom zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified\nrepresentation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene\nscale variations. More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide\nalong the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales. A\nsmaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth\nprecision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in\nfar regions.

It is\ncommonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each\nWSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are\nconsidered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large\nnumber of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when\nutilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders\nmost existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical\npractice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification\n(WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number\nof bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the\nabsence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image\nclassification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images\nunsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a\nconcise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem\nthrough two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two\nheterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance\nclassification and bag classification.

Inspired by this temporal non-uniformity, we\npropose VGDFR, a training-free approach for Diffusion-based Video Generation\nwith Dynamic Latent Frame Rate. VGDFR adaptively adjusts the number of elements\nin latent space based on the motion frequency of the latent space content,\nusing fewer tokens for low-frequency segments while preserving detail in\nhigh-frequency segments. Specifically, our key contributions are: (1) A dynamic\nframe rate scheduler for DiT video generation that adaptively assigns frame\nrates for video segments. (2) A novel latent-space frame merging method to\nalign latent representations with their denoised counterparts before merging\nthose redundant in low-resolution space. (3) A preference analysis of Rotary\nPositional Embeddings (RoPE) across DiT layers, informing a tailored RoPE\nstrategy optimized for semantic and local information capture.

It is reconstructed based on the\npreviously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for\nindividual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to\nlocal temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking.

Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass\nSpectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment,\ngenerates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical\ndecision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts\npresents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a\nfoundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this\nlimitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We\npropose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is\nan adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio\nassociation, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach\nbased on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed\nmodel against other models and pretraining methods.

Specifically, learned systems for scene\nmeasurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios\ndeviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose\nestimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual\nodometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online\nmanner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework\nfor monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation\nmodule. Firstly, we design a monocular depth estimation network with\nlightweight refiner modules, which enables efficient online adaptation. Then,\nwe construct an objective for self-supervised learning of the depth estimation\nmodule based on the output of the visual odometry system and the contextual\nsemantic information of the scene. Specifically, a sparse depth densification\nmodule and a dynamic consistency enhancement module are proposed to leverage\ncamera poses and contextual semantics to generate pseudo-depths and valid masks\nfor the online adaptation.

Online source-free UDA has emerged\nas a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted\nand target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world\nnature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts\nmeaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free\nuniversal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing\nmethods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship\nbetween pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To\nbridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled\nexperiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into\npseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap\nbetween the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved\nwith perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables\neffective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a\ncross-entropy loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves\nsuperior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our\nfindings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than\nquantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels\nis beneficial.
