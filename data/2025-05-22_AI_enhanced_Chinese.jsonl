However, existing methods fail to provide complete, faithful, and\nexpressive control over human avatars due to their entangled representation of\nfacial expressions and body movements. In this work, we introduce Expressive\nVirtual Avatars (EVA), an actor-specific, fully controllable, and expressive\nhuman avatar framework that achieves high-fidelity, lifelike renderings in real\ntime while enabling independent control of facial expressions, body movements,\nand hand gestures. Specifically, our approach designs the human avatar as a\ntwo-layer model: an expressive template geometry layer and a 3D Gaussian\nappearance layer. First, we present an expressive template tracking algorithm\nthat leverages coarse-to-fine optimization to accurately recover body motions,\nfacial expressions, and non-rigid deformation parameters from multi-view\nvideos. Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model\ndesigned to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance.

However,\ntheir computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts\nfor over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video\ntakes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and\nscalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free\nframework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic\nsparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across\nframes in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field\nover the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution\ndraft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both\nspatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the\nquery, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse\nattention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their\noriginal order after the attention computation. This reordering enables\nstructured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention\nclosely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for\nconstructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our\nmethod outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation\nquality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs.

While existing approaches have achieved notable results in\nverifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1)\nExisting methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting\nlocal object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge\nand entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that\nintegrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach\nleverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for\nglobal image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further\nenhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant\nentities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed\nthrough a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing\nthe effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for\nfake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded\nmultimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and\nNLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to\nsemantically grounded verification.

Reader\ndiscretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated\nincreasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving\nand medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world\napplications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align\nwith human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing\nwork on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies\nheavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced\nrealism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)\nusing diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,\nspanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in\neveryday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality\nimage-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic\nannotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality\nannotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.\nFor evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \\textit{moral judgment} and\n\\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral\nviolations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses\na significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current\nstate-of-the-art models.

The relevance of image recognition models\nto real-world applications lies in their ability to generalize to these rare\nclasses as well as unseen classes. Real-world generalization requires taking\ninto account the various complexities that can be encountered in the\nreal-world. First, training data is highly imbalanced, which may lead to model\nexhibiting bias toward the more frequently represented classes. Moreover,\nreal-world data may contain unseen classes that need to be identified, and\nmodel performance is affected by the data scarcity. While medical image\nrecognition has been extensively addressed in the literature, current methods\ndo not take into account all the intricacies in the real-world scenarios. To\nthis end, we propose an open-set learning method for highly imbalanced medical\ndatasets using a semi-supervised approach.

In medical imaging, VG\nenhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features\ncorresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and\ntrustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical\npractice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with\ndisease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of\nfine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate\ntwo key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background\ntokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the\nglobal tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local\ndisease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and\ndisease tokens.

While existing methods utilize\nmomentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they\noverlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class\nknowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target\nclasses introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To\naddress these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that\nintegrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through\ntheoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics\nin task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design\nindependent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual\ninterference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for\ntask-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class\ngradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce\na dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small\ninitial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses,\nfollowing curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters\nlow-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively\npurifying dark knowledge during early training.

Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories\nby altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their\ntypically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several\nstudies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are\nusually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from\nLLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including\nthe previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional\nfeatures of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised\ncontent may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an\naugmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which\nsupplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM\nto reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the\nrewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We\nsubsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of\nConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or\nexceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content\nin ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other\nbaselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2.

To bridge this\ngap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise,\nmanual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography\ndimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot\nangle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and\nincludes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear\ncinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question\nanswer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret\nand explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess\nadvanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct\ncinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or\nkeyframes.

A critical and underexplored issue is the\nreinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized\ncaste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by\nproposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and\nassess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates\ncaste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,\nand political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By\nbenchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models\nsystematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in\nthe treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias\nscores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant\ncaste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.\nThese results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and\nemphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation\nmethodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in\nreal-world contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDECASTE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u79cd\u59d3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728NLP\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea6\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u79cd\u59d3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDECASTE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u79cd\u59d3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\u79cd\u59d3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u79cd\u59d3\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5982Dalits\u548cShudras\uff09\u53d7\u5230\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u5f85\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u85cf\u7684\u79cd\u59d3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Current\napproaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only\nstruggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target\nfeatures, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex\nomni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance\nvariations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing\nparadigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing\nimaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor\nplatforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this\nlimitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target\nDetector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines\nthe IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware\noptimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with\nvisual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual\nsample.

Existing approaches\nhave rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D\nstyle transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to\n3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of\nthe scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture\ntransfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture\ntransfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching\ntexture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the\nissue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture\naugmentation module to expand the texture feature set.

To verify a\nclaim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying\non embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with\nevidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later\nhave not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that\nfact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through\nmultiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence\npieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more\ncomplex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on\nentailment and the generative ability of language models to produce\n''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a\nclaim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved\nsuperior results.

In this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional bottleneck network\nto reduce feature redundancy while enhancing the discriminative power of\nfeatures extracted by CLIP, thereby improving the model's generalization\nability. We begin with a semantic analysis experiment, where we observe that\narbitrary text features exhibit lower cosine similarity with real image\nfeatures than with fake image features in the CLIP feature space, a phenomenon\nwe refer to as \"bias\".

TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned\nrepresentations by conditioning on both text and class modalities.

Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven\ndual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores\nwith caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that\nprogressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of\nscene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly\nreduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on\nScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset)\nwhile reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a\ncompact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training.

Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through\ndata poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an\nattacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a\nnormal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor\nattacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned\nlow-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR\nimages, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this\nproblem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR\nimages. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the\npre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications\nto the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images\ngenerated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve\nthe effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a\nbackdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic\nalgorithm.

Mainstream self-attention methods,\nwhile effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture\nhigh-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from\nredundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling\nhigh-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these\nlimitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on\nstatic and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant\nhyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of\nvisual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural\nNetworks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation,\nto make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our\nframework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is\nassociated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than\nhard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is\nachieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype.

Fine-tuning such models for downstream\ntasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a\nmultispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).\nWe explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank\nKronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for\nlow-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda.

For\ninstance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,\nsuch as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.\nEffective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article\nwhile preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.\nDUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in\ndifferent styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and\nother content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for\nunlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving\nshared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning\nmethods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent\nunlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove\nsurface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge\nwithout damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to\nsupport the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for\nreal-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "DUSK\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DUSK\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f8\u540c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f46\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6587\u6863\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e03\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5d\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u79fb\u9664\u8868\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5220\u9664\u6df1\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "DUSK\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network\n(FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate\nthe full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot\nmanner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process,\npredicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach\nfor predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN\nestablishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an\natomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information\nfrom neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image\nat the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data.\nMoreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a\npixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation\nprocess, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused\nby reflectance differences.

To bypass\nthese detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these\ntexts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require\nsubstantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,\nand their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection\nalgorithms. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Co}ntrastive\n\\textbf{P}araphrase \\textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that\neffectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is\nto carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like\ntexts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can\nstill result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes\nthat can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an\nauxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like\ndistribution generated by the LLM.

However, their\nenhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety\nperformance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important\nresearch question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs\nthrough Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an\nunexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1\nfails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify\nthree key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that\nexplicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can\nlead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and\ncomplex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we\nfind that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain\ncomparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn\nthan more intricate reasoning chains.

Finally, we find that mixing math\nreasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and\nover-refusal.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for\nmulti-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components\nincluding a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism\nfor tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of\nmulti-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and\ncross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token\nlevel, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process\nthe most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence\nlevel, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a\ndiversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples\nwithin a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more\nfrequently selected for training.

However, existing\nmethods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative\nsamples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which\nresults in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts\nthe overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically\ntreated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the\nalignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in\naligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nHard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard\nnegatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based\nnegatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nAHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard\nnegative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within\neach modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin\naccording to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample\npairs.

Recently, low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs.\nHowever, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA\nbranch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to\ncontribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this\nwork, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation\n(GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task\nand introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches.\nFurthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the\ncontribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating\nforgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results\non CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGainLoRA\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u65e7LoRA\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5f3a\u5236\u65b0\u65e7LoRA\u5206\u652f\u5bf9\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u8d21\u732e\u5747\u7b49\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGainLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55LoRA\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u65e7\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b0\u5206\u652f\u5bf9\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGainLoRA\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GainLoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured,\nwhereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less\nstudied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of\ncapture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model\nperformance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and\nvisual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common\nvision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\\textbf{S}$hutter speed,\nISO se$\\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of\nobjects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled\ncamera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show\nthe effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we\nconduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our\nresults show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models\ntrained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed\nimages, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute\nvariations of camera settings.

Specifically, the\ndataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data\ncollection and annotated by professional dentists. In addition, we performed a\ncomprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based\nmethods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted\nautomated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental\nresults show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis\nresearch of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in\nthis field.

We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of\nprompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the\ndeviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then\ninterpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly\nlearning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data\nsparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth\nadaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without\naccess to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+\ninstruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning\ntasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in\nimproving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faJoint Flashback Adaptation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\uff08flashbacks\uff09\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6613\u53d7\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJoint Flashback Adaptation\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408flashbacks\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u57281000+\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "Joint Flashback Adaptation\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free\nframework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single\ntop-down view.

Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions\nand generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked\nrectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while\nmaintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome\nresolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D\nsupervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show\nthat 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,\nHunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and\ntexture fidelity.

Additionally, models frequently switch to\nEnglish mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts.\nWe further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning\nthoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal\nconsistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our\nfindings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an\nunsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers\nhigh-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all\nlanguages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance.\nMITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance,\nespecially for underrepresented languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\uff08test-time scaling\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MITT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B\u548cDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B\u5728\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u7cfb\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMITT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u56e0\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002MITT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MITT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u3002"}}

We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference\nconcepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,\n\"positive\" and \"negative\"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target\nconcept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For\ninstance, the understanding of \"food\" should not skew toward any particular\nsentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of\nLLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring\nmodel responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort\nand captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based\non the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept\nActivation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract\ninterpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the\nvariation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of\nthe reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong\nagreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >\n0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect\nusing existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a\npatient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic\nassessments.

This\narchitecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data\ntypes. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning\nstrategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning\nreasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy\nfacilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL)\nstage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the\noutset.

To achieve\naccurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention\nmodule of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset\nand exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose\na novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,\nmaking two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color\ntransfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map\nbetween the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic\ncorrespondences. The color features from the reference image is then\ntransferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by\nthis attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the\ncorresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate\nattention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more\nprecise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization\nguidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred\nand non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of\ncolorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference.\nSpecifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research,\nachieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to\nthe reference).

However, these extended outputs often exhibit\nsubstantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we\ninvestigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,\nwe first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient\nreasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on\nthis perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method\n(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target\nlength. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed\nLASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both\nreasoning performance and response length efficiency.

However, its scattered distribution\nacross data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their\ndeployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based\nsplit learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the\nserver while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to\nensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,\nefficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,\nleading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of\nLLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,\ncausing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack\nadaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a\nsecure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.\nFirst, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject\nGaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end\npropagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies\nto achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV\ncache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs\neffectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points\nfor input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware\nlimitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show\nthat FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and\nachieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups.

To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel\narchitecture for medical image segmentation.

In this work, such\ndisparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature\nsubspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD\nfeatures to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns\nof OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their\ndifferent distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations\nof InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD\ndetection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal\nComponent Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and\ndeploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD\ndata. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear\nsubspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the\ncomputation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data.

However, diffusion language models have long\nbeen constrained by slow inference.

We address this bottleneck by\nproposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising\nprocess of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different\ntokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.\nAccordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and\nvalue states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value\nstep-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless\nacceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that\nexisting DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2)\ndKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving\nhigher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance\ndegradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference,\nlargely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on\nseveral benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language\nunderstanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks.

Second,\nwe incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate\nreward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length\nnormalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better\noptimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with\nQwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on\nScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even\noutperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI\nagent grounding.

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for\nenhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an\nLLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,\ncurrent RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are\nfixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is\ntrained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without\nrequiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained\nverifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to\ndeterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual\nreinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both\ncomponents of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:\nthe generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level\nmath benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the\nverifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit\nparticularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical\nreasoning problems.

By cutting the parts that have little effect on the\ncomputation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation\ncomputation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient\nvariance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention\nbecomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically\nwith sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising\ntargets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing\n$c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about\n$1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$.

We show optimization with our estimators reduces to\nstandard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and\nefficient transformation function.\n  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable\nrobust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of\ntrading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k\nduring training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1\nnumbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\n  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the\nvariance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world\nexamples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation\neffectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable\nsolving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and\npass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1\noptimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to\nbetter exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual\nsamples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPKPO\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316pass@k\u6027\u80fd\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316pass@1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u5956\u52b1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPKPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u6362\u6700\u7ec8\u5956\u52b1\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316pass@k\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PKPO\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574k\u503c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861pass@1\u548cpass@k\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PKPO\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u96c6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

While refusal responses can be viewed\nas evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research\nsuggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated\nassessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and\ntraining. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used\nto evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking\nand fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess\nrefusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot\nArena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how\ndifferent types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which\nexplicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., \"I can't help with that\nbecause it may be harmful\"), and technical refusals, which reflect system\nlimitations (e.g., \"I can't answer because I lack real-time data\"). We find\nthat LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more\nfavorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.\nWe refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for\nmodel-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.\nThis raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the\nnormative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u5219\u65e0\u6b64\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u8c03\u8282\u504f\u5dee\u201d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u62d2\u7edd\u548c\u6280\u672f\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Chatbot Arena\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e24\u79cdAI\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\u548cLlama 3 70B\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f26\u7406\u62d2\u7edd\u548c\u6280\u672f\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u201c\u8c03\u8282\u504f\u5dee\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u601d\u8003\u3002"}}

Such threats have raised critical concerns\nabout the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While\nexisting defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent\nadvancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods\nto circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense\nframeworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking\nthreats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary\nstudy demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against\na particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack\npattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a\nscalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive\nperformance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,\ncontributing a new paradigm to LLM safety.
