### [1] [Hello, won't you tell me your name?: Investigating Anonymity Abuse in IPFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04307)
*Christos Karapapas,Iakovos Pittaras,George C. Polyzos,Constantinos Patsakis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究揭示了Pinning服务和公共网关在维护内容可用性方面的能力和局限性，特别是在处理恶意内容方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索恶意行为者如何利用IPFS匿名上传和传播有害内容。

Method: 使用脚本系统地测试了这些服务的恶意文件上传行为。

Result: 分析发现，Pinning服务和公共网关缺乏评估或限制恶意内容传播的机制。

Conclusion: Pinning服务和公共网关缺乏评估或限制恶意内容传播的机制。

Abstract: The InterPlanetary File System~(IPFS) offers a decentralized approach to file
storage and sharing, promising resilience and efficiency while also realizing
the Web3 paradigm. Simultaneously, the offered anonymity raises significant
questions about potential misuse. In this study, we explore methods that
malicious actors can exploit IPFS to upload and disseminate harmful content
while remaining anonymous. We evaluate the role of pinning services and public
gateways, identifying their capabilities and limitations in maintaining content
availability. Using scripts, we systematically test the behavior of these
services by uploading malicious files. Our analysis reveals that pinning
services and public gateways lack mechanisms to assess or restrict the
propagation of malicious content.

### [2] [The Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) Problem: From Symbolic Path Inversion to Post-Quantum Cryptographic Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04383)
*Mohamed Aly Bouke*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HFKR是一种基于符号动力系统和混沌扰动的非代数密码构造，能有效抵抗量子攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对经典密码系统在量子攻击和结构密码分析下的脆弱性。

Method: HFKR利用合同仿射映射生成符号轨迹，并通过哈希混淆将其压缩成密钥。

Result: HFKR在250次扰动试验中表现出有效的符号差异放大，证明了其抗量子安全性。

Conclusion: HFKR基于符号动力系统和混沌扰动，通过哈希混淆将符号轨迹压缩成固定长度的密钥，并证明其抗量子攻击能力。

Abstract: Classical cryptographic systems rely heavily on structured algebraic
problems, such as factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based
assumptions, which are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks and
structural cryptanalysis. In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal
Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction
grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the
Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories
generated via contractive affine maps over $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them
into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key
contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic
paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path
geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension
increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic
self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the
entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation
trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,
achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible
entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but
weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises
from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy
amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free
foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on
algebraic hardness assumptions.

### [3] [Through the Stealth Lens: Rethinking Attacks and Defenses in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04390)
*Sarthak Choudhary,Nils Palumbo,Ashish Hooda,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Somesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力模式的过滤算法，能够有效减轻RAG系统的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统易受攻击，需要改进防御策略。

Method: 提出了一种基于注意力模式的过滤算法，用于检测和过滤潜在的毒化段落。

Result: 该方法能够减轻现有攻击，将准确率提高约20%。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

### [4] [Learning to Diagnose Privately: DP-Powered LLMs for Radiology Report Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04450)
*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Ravi Tandon,Joseph Lo,Heidi Hanson,Geoffrey Rubin,Nirav Merchant,John Gounley*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A framework for fine-tuning LLMs with DP is proposed to classify multi-abnormality in radiology reports, achieving privacy-preserving and comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance.

Method: Fine-tuning of LLMs using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes. The model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base.

Result: DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.

Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

### [5] [BESA: Boosting Encoder Stealing Attack with Perturbation Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04556)
*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BESA的增强编码器窃取攻击方法，显著提高了现有攻击的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服基于扰动的防御，提高编码器窃取攻击的性能。

Method: BESA包含两个模块：扰动检测和扰动恢复，可以与规范编码器窃取攻击相结合。扰动检测模块利用从目标编码器获取的特征向量来推断服务提供商采用的防御机制。一旦检测到防御机制，扰动恢复模块利用精心设计的生成模型从扰动的特征向量中恢复干净的特征向量。

Result: 在多种数据集上进行了广泛的评估，证明了BESA的有效性。

Conclusion: BESA显著提高了现有编码器窃取攻击的代理编码器精度，在面临最先进的防御和多种防御组合时，最高可达24.63%。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

### [6] [Incentivizing Collaborative Breach Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04634)
*Mridu Nanda,Michael K. Reiter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于交换监控服务的算法，用于提高网站检测自身漏洞的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高网站检测自身漏洞的能力，我们提出了一个通过交换监控服务来实现的算法。

Method: 我们通过模型检查分析，证明了使用我们的算法，当网站增加为其他网站投入的监控力度时，它可以提高检测自身漏洞的能力。

Result: 我们通过一个真实的数据集对算法进行了评估，并提供了一个性能分析，证实了其可扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Decoy passwords, or "honeywords," alert a site to its breach if they are ever
entered in a login attempt on that site. However, an attacker can identify a
user-chosen password from among the decoys, without risk of alerting the site
to its breach, by performing credential stuffing, i.e., entering the stolen
passwords at another site where the same user reused her password. Prior work
has thus proposed that sites monitor for the entry of their honeywords at other
sites. Unfortunately, it is not clear what incentives sites have to participate
in this monitoring. In this paper we propose and evaluate an algorithm by which
sites can exchange monitoring favors. Through a model-checking analysis, we
show that using our algorithm, a site improves its ability to detect its own
breach when it increases the monitoring effort it expends for other sites. We
additionally quantify the impacts of various parameters on detection
effectiveness and their implications for the deployment of a system to support
a monitoring ecosystem. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on a real dataset of
breached credentials and provide a performance analysis that confirms its
scalability and practical viability.

### [7] [Authenticated Private Set Intersection: A Merkle Tree-Based Approach for Enhancing Data Integrity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04647)
*Zixian Gong,Zhiyong Zheng,Zhe Hu,Kun Tian,Yi Zhang,Zhedanov Oleksiy,Fengxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Merkle树的PSI方案，以解决数据完整性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PSI协议对数据完整性攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 结合Merkle树和先进的PSI协议。

Result: 提出的方案通信复杂度与最佳未认证PSI方案相当，但引入了额外的开销。

Conclusion: 提出数据完整性的定义，构建了两种经过验证的PSI方案，并讨论了潜在改进。

Abstract: Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables secure computation of set
intersections while preserving participant privacy, standard PSI existing
protocols remain vulnerable to data integrity attacks allowing malicious
participants to extract additional intersection information or mislead other
parties. In this paper, we propose the definition of data integrity in PSI and
construct two authenticated PSI schemes by integrating Merkle Trees with
state-of-the-art two-party volePSI and multi-party mPSI protocols. The
resulting two-party authenticated PSI achieves communication complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n \lambda+n \log n)$, aligning with the best-known unauthenticated
PSI schemes, while the multi-party construction is $\mathcal{O}(n \kappa+n \log
n)$ which introduces additional overhead due to Merkle tree inclusion proofs.
Due to the incorporation of integrity verification, our authenticated schemes
incur higher costs compared to state-of-the-art unauthenticated schemes. We
also provide efficient implementations of our protocols and discuss potential
improvements, including alternative authentication blocks.

### [8] [MULTISS: un protocole de stockage confidentiel {à} long terme sur plusieurs r{é}seaux QKD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04800)
*Thomas Prévost,Olivier Alibart,Marc Kaplan,Anne Marin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MULTISS的新协议，用于在多个量子密钥分发（QKD）网络上进行长期存储。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高QKD网络在长期存储中的安全性。

Method: 使用分层密钥共享，将秘密分布在多个QKD网络上，同时确保完美安全。

Result: MULTISS比LINCOS更安全，LINCOS在QKD网络被破坏时仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: MULTISS协议在安全性方面优于LINCOS。

Abstract: This paper presents MULTISS, a new protocol for long-term storage distributed
across multiple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. This protocol is an
extension of LINCOS, a secure storage protocol that uses Shamir secret sharing
for secret storage on a single QKD network. Our protocol uses hierarchical
secret sharing to distribute a secret across multiple QKD networks while
ensuring perfect security. Our protocol further allows for sharing updates
without having to reconstruct the entire secret. We also prove that MULTISS is
strictly more secure than LINCOS, which remains vulnerable when its QKD network
is compromised.

### [9] [On Automating Security Policies with Contemporary LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04838)
*Pablo Fernández Saura,K. R. Jayaram,Vatche Isahagian,Jorge Bernal Bernabé,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLMs的自动化攻击缓解策略合规性框架，通过RAG技术显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算环境的复杂性和网络威胁的日益复杂化，需要更强大、自适应和自动化的安全执行方法。

Method: 使用LLMs，结合上下文学习和RAG，自动化攻击缓解策略的合规性。

Result: 使用RAG与无RAG基线相比，在精度、召回率和F1分数方面均有显著提高。

Conclusion: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的框架，通过上下文学习和检索增强生成（RAG）自动化攻击缓解策略的合规性。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

### [10] [A Private Smart Wallet with Probabilistic Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04853)
*Andrea Rizzini,Marco Esposito,Francesco Bruschi,Donatella Sciuto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种隐私保护智能钱包，具有基于邀请的私有注册机制和两层合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数字支付中的隐私保护和合规性问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于邀请的私有注册机制，并结合权威方实施两层合规性：无罪证明机制和利用Bloom过滤器进行概率性UTXO链状态的祖先承诺跟踪系统。

Result: 在消费级笔记本电脑上，带有合规性检查的私有转账可以在几秒钟内完成，整体上证明生成保持较低水平。

Conclusion: 验证了隐私保护、合规意识数字支付方法的可行性，同时最小化了计算和财务开销。

Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving smart wallet with a novel invitation-based
private onboarding mechanism. The solution integrates two levels of compliance
in concert with an authority party: a proof of innocence mechanism and an
ancestral commitment tracking system using bloom filters for probabilistic UTXO
chain states. Performance analysis demonstrates practical efficiency: private
transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on a consumer-grade
laptop, and overall with proof generation remaining low. On-chain costs stay
minimal, ensuring affordability for all operations on Base layer 2 network. The
wallet facilitates private contact list management through encrypted data blobs
while maintaining transaction unlinkability. Our evaluation validates the
approach's viability for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments
with minimized computational and financial overhead.

### [11] [PoCGen: Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Vulnerabilities in Npm Packages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04962)
*Deniz Simsek,Aryaz Eghbali,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoCGen：一种利用LLMs自动生成和验证PoC利用代码的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漏洞报告通常缺乏必要的PoC利用代码，而创建PoC利用代码具有挑战性，因为漏洞报告通常非正式且不完整，并且需要详细理解输入如何到达可能的安全相关目标。

Method: PoCGen利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和静态、动态分析技术，自动生成和验证npm包中漏洞的PoC利用代码。

Result: PoCGen在SecBench.js数据集中成功生成77%的漏洞利用代码，在新的数据集中生成39%。

Conclusion: PoCGen能够成功生成SecBench.js数据集中77%的漏洞利用代码，在新的更具有挑战性的数据集中生成39%。这一成功率显著优于最近的基线（高出45个百分点），同时平均每个生成的漏洞利用代码的成本为0.02美元。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

### [12] [Hiding in Plain Sight: Query Obfuscation via Random Multilingual Searches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04963)
*Anton Firc,Jan Klusáček,Kamil Malinka*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种查询混淆策略，以保护用户隐私并防止搜索结果被个人化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代搜索引擎通过构建详细用户档案来个性化搜索结果，这引入了隐私风险和过滤泡沫。

Method: 使用随机生成的多语言搜索查询进行混淆，以破坏用户档案。

Result: 结果表明，在混淆的情况下，搜索引擎识别的用户兴趣会显著变化，而显示的搜索结果保持稳定。

Conclusion: 提出并评估了一种轻量级的客户端查询混淆策略，以保护用户隐私，防止搜索结果被个人化。

Abstract: Modern search engines extensively personalize results by building detailed
user profiles based on query history and behaviour. While personalization can
enhance relevance, it introduces privacy risks and can lead to filter bubbles.
This paper proposes and evaluates a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation
strategy using randomly generated multilingual search queries to disrupt user
profiling. Through controlled experiments on the Seznam.cz search engine, we
assess the impact of interleaving real queries with obfuscating noise in
various language configurations and ratios. Our findings show that while
displayed search results remain largely stable, the search engine's identified
user interests shift significantly under obfuscation. We further demonstrate
that such random queries can prevent accurate profiling and overwrite
established user profiles. This study provides practical evidence for query
obfuscation as a viable privacy-preserving mechanism and introduces a tool that
enables users to autonomously protect their search behaviour without modifying
existing infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于联邦学习的CAN入侵检测系统，证明了其在车载网络入侵检测中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究将联邦学习策略集成到基于机器学习的车载网络入侵检测过程中的影响。

Method: 提出基于LSTM自动编码器的CAN入侵检测系统（IDS）的联邦学习实现。

Result: 全面评估了其检测效率和通信开销，并将其与集中式版本的同种算法进行比较，从而证明了其可行性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: The challenges derived from the data-intensive nature of machine learning in
conjunction with technologies that enable novel paradigms such as V2X and the
potential offered by 5G communication, allow and justify the deployment of
Federated Learning (FL) solutions in the vehicular intrusion detection domain.
In this paper, we investigate the effects of integrating FL strategies into the
machine learning-based intrusion detection process for on-board vehicular
networks. Accordingly, we propose a FL implementation of a state-of-the-art
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Controller Area Network (CAN), based on
LSTM autoencoders. We thoroughly evaluate its detection efficiency and
communication overhead, comparing it to a centralized version of the same
algorithm, thereby presenting it as a feasible solution.

TL;DR: FEAD是一种基于关注点的攻击检测框架，显著提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全检测方法存在数据收集不足、资源密集型和检测算法错误率高等问题。

Method: FEAD采用攻击模型驱动的方法、高效的任务分解和局部感知异常分析来提高检测性能。

Result: FEAD在F1-score上比现有解决方案提高了8.23%，同时仅增加了5.4%的开销。

Conclusion: FEAD通过三种创新解决了传统安全检测方法的挑战，实现了更高的检测性能。

Abstract: Traditional security detection methods face three key challenges: inadequate
data collection that misses critical security events, resource-intensive
monitoring systems, and poor detection algorithms with high false positive
rates. We present FEAD (Focus-Enhanced Attack Detection), a framework that
addresses these issues through three innovations: (1) an attack model-driven
approach that extracts security-critical monitoring items from online attack
reports for comprehensive coverage; (2) efficient task decomposition that
optimally distributes monitoring across existing collectors to minimize
overhead; and (3) locality-aware anomaly analysis that leverages the clustering
behavior of malicious activities in provenance graphs to improve detection
accuracy. Evaluations demonstrate FEAD achieves 8.23% higher F1-score than
existing solutions with only 5.4% overhead, confirming that focus-based designs
significantly enhance detection performance.

*Robert J. Joyce,Gideon Miller,Phil Roth,Richard Zak,Elliott Zaresky-Williams,Hyrum Anderson,Edward Raff,James Holt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出新的数据集 EMBER2024，支持更全面的恶意软件分类器评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据集范围狭窄、标签单一的问题，并创建一个评估对抗性恶意软件的“挑战”集。

Method: 通过收集超过320万个文件的哈希、元数据、特征向量和标签来创建数据集。

Result: EMBER2024 数据集支持7个恶意软件分类任务，包括检测、分类和行为识别。

Conclusion: 提出一个新的数据集 EMBER2024，支持对恶意软件分类器的整体评估。

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 我们通过调整成员身份推断攻击来提高序列模型隐私泄露审计的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列模型，如大型语言模型（LLMs）和自回归图像生成器，倾向于记忆并无意中泄露敏感信息。

Method: 我们将最先进的成员身份推断攻击调整为显式地建模序列内的相关性，从而证明了如何将强大的现有攻击自然扩展以适应序列模型的结构。

Result: 我们的调整在引入额外计算成本的情况下，始终如一地提高了记忆审计的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为大型序列模型的可靠记忆审计铺平了道路。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

*Andrin Bertschi,Shweta Shinde*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出OpenCCA，一个开源平台，用于在通用Armv8.2硬件上执行CCA-bound代码，以提高研究Arm CCA的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Arm CCA时缺乏硬件支持，导致研究效率低下、性能比较不一致和入门门槛高。

Method: 通过系统性地适配软件堆栈，包括引导加载程序、固件、虚拟机管理程序和内核，OpenCCA模拟CCA操作以进行性能评估，同时保持功能正确性。

Result: 展示了OpenCCA在典型生命周期测量和基于先前CCA研究论文的案例研究中的有效性，使用易于获得的Armv8.2 Rockchip板，价格为250美元。

Conclusion: 提出OpenCCA，一个开源研究平台，用于在通用Armv8.2硬件上执行CCA-bound代码，以解决研究Arm CCA时缺乏硬件支持的问题。

Abstract: Confidential computing has gained traction across major architectures with
Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. Unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, a key challenge in
researching Arm CCA is the absence of hardware support, forcing researchers to
develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards. This approach
leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high
barriers to entry. To address this, we present OpenCCA, an open research
platform that enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2
hardware. By systematically adapting the software stack -- including
bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel -- OpenCCA emulates CCA operations
for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. We
demonstrate its effectiveness with typical life-cycle measurements and
case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2
Rockchip board that costs $250.

TL;DR: SECNEURON是一个用于本地部署LLMs的访问控制框架，有效限制未经授权的任务滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地部署的LLMs存在安全和可控性挑战，现有技术无法有效解决。

Method: SECNEURON使用神经元级加密和选择性解密来动态控制LLMs的任务特定能力，限制未经授权的任务滥用，同时不损害其他任务。

Result: SECNEURON在限制未经授权的任务准确率的同时，保持授权准确率损失低于2%。

Conclusion: SECNEURON是一个在本地部署的LLMs中嵌入经典访问控制的框架，实现了可靠的、经济的、灵活的、认证的滥用控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities are increasingly being
deployed in local environments, presenting significant security and
controllability challenges. These locally deployed LLMs operate outside the
direct control of developers, rendering them more susceptible to abuse.
Existing mitigation techniques mainly designed for cloud-based LLM services are
frequently circumvented or ineffective in deployer-controlled environments. We
propose SECNEURON, the first framework that seamlessly embeds classic access
control within the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, achieving reliable,
cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs.
SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to
dynamically control the task-specific capabilities of LLMs, limiting
unauthorized task abuse without compromising others. We first design a
task-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons
and construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. We then
introduce a flexible and efficient hybrid encryption framework for millions of
neurons in LLMs. Finally, we developed a distribution-based decrypted neuron
detection mechanism on ciphertext to ensure the effectiveness of partially
decrypted LLMs. We proved that SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and
Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle.
Experiments on various task settings show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized
task accuracy to below 25% while keeping authorized accuracy loss with 2%.
Using an unauthorized Code task example, the accuracy of abuse-related
malicious code generation was reduced from 59% to 15%. SECNEURON also mitigates
unauthorized data leakage, reducing PII extraction rates to below 5% and
membership inference to random guesses.

TL;DR: Big Bird是一种用于PPA的隐私预算管理工具，提高了预算利用率和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前PPA设计中缺乏隐私预算管理方法的问题。

Method: Big Bird通过资源隔离原则和批量调度算法实现隐私预算管理。

Result: Big Bird在Firefox中实现，并在实际广告数据上进行了评估，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Big Bird为PPA提供了一种隐私预算管理方法，提高了全球预算利用率，并确保了隐私保护。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving advertising APIs like Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA)
are designed to enhance web privacy while enabling effective ad measurement.
PPA offers an alternative to cross-site tracking with encrypted reports
governed by differential privacy (DP), but current designs lack a principled
approach to privacy budget management, creating uncertainty around critical
design decisions. We present Big Bird, a privacy budget manager for PPA that
clarifies per-site budget semantics and introduces a global budgeting system
grounded in resource isolation principles. Big Bird enforces utility-preserving
limits via quota budgets and improves global budget utilization through a novel
batched scheduling algorithm. Together, these mechanisms establish a robust
foundation for enforcing privacy protections in adversarial environments. We
implement Big Bird in Firefox and evaluate it on real-world ad data,
demonstrating its resilience and effectiveness.

TL;DR: 研究强调了上游数据集设计在构建坚固的安全防护措施中的重要性，并通过降低数据集的相似性，降低了模型遭受劫持攻击的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注在安全防护措施被破坏后，反应性地解决劫持事件、移除有害梯度或在整个微调过程中持续强化安全对齐。这些方法往往忽略了上游数据集设计这一关键因素。

Method: 研究通过分析上游数据集与下游任务之间的表示相似性来研究安全防护措施的退化。

Result: 实验表明，上游数据集与下游任务之间的相似性越高，安全防护措施越容易受到破坏。降低相似性可以显著提高模型的安全性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，上游数据集与下游任务之间的相似性越高，安全防护措施越容易受到破坏，模型越容易遭受劫持攻击。通过降低这些数据集的相似性，可以显著提高模型的安全性，减少有害评分高达10.33%。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Result: 实现了89%的欺骗检测精度，达到了40%的成功率在无明确提示的情况下诱导与上下文相关的欺骗。

Conclusion: 通过表示工程，我们系统地诱导、检测和控制了CoT启用的LLMs中的欺骗，通过线性人工断层扫描（LAT）提取“欺骗向量”，实现了89%的检测精度。通过激活引导，我们达到了40%的成功率，在不进行明确提示的情况下诱导与上下文相关的欺骗，揭示了推理模型的特定诚信问题，并为可信赖的AI对齐提供了工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Method: ProLoRA通过将源调整投影到目标模型权重空间，利用子空间和零空间的相似性，并选择性地针对对齐的层，实现了零样本适应。

Result: ProLoRA在文本到图像扩散模型中实现了成功的知识迁移，并且在无需重新训练的情况下取得了可比的性能。

Conclusion: ProLoRA通过投影源调整到目标模型权重空间，实现了参数高效微调的零样本适应。在文本到图像的扩散模型中，它克服了传统方法在切换基础模型时需要重新训练的局限性。ProLoRA在现有文本到图像模型上的评估显示，它实现了知识迁移，并且在无需重新训练的情况下取得了可比的性能。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，通过显式推理来提高AI代理的上下文完整性，以减少不适当的信息披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保在执行任务时共享适当的信息，即上下文完整性（CI），成为该领域的一个关键问题。

Method: 开发了一个基于强化学习的框架，该框架通过显式推理来提高AI代理的上下文完整性。

Result: 该方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持了任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成数据集和现有CI基准上均有效。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HADA旨在解决在大型语言模型（LLM）代理和传统算法与组织目标和价值观之间保持一致性的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为HADA（人机代理决策对齐）的协议和框架无关的参考架构，该架构将大型语言模型（LLM）代理和传统算法与组织目标和价值观保持一致。HADA将任何算法或LLM封装在具有特定角色的利益相关者代理中——业务、数据科学、审计、伦理和客户——每个代理都公开了会话API，以便技术和非技术演员可以查询、引导、审计或质疑战略、战术和实时范围内的每个决策。对齐目标、KPI和价值约束用自然语言表达，并在成千上万的异构代理在不同的编排堆栈上运行的同时持续传播、记录和版本控制。

Result: HADA通过设计-科学研究方法进行了评估，结果表明，HADA能够实现以下目标：每个角色都可以调用会话控制，跟踪KPI和价值约束，检测和减轻ZIP代码偏差，以及独立于底层LLM或代理库重现完整的决策线。

Conclusion: 贡献包括：1) 开源HADA架构；2) 多智能体系统中人机对齐的中等设计理论；3) 实证证据表明，框架无关、协议合规的利益相关者代理可以提高实际决策流程中的准确性、透明度和道德合规性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Conclusion: EXIF能够有效地发现有意义的能力，并迭代地扩展训练代理的能力，而无需任何人工干预，从而实现显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Conclusion: 提出的图框架通过利用人工编写的知识来显式编码模式链接和连接路径，在标准基准和实际的大规模数据集上证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人工智能的新颖方法，以解决公共卫生数据监控问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共卫生专家需要可扩展的方法来监测大量健康数据（例如病例、住院、死亡），以应对爆发或数据质量问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于排名的监控范式，利用新的AI异常检测方法。

Result: 该系统在一个月的纵向部署评估中，与传统的基于警报的方法相比，监控目标显著提高，审查员速度效率提高了54倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了以人为本的人工智能在公共卫生决策中转型的潜力。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLMs在匹配市场中的推理能力，发现它们在处理大型市场中的不稳定性方面存在困难，并提出了一种参数高效的微调方法来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理组合域中的排序偏好和结构化算法方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 评估了几个最先进的模型在一系列基于偏好的推理任务上的表现，包括稳定匹配生成、不稳定性检测、不稳定性解决和细粒度偏好查询。

Result: 研究结果表明，LLMs在处理大型市场中的不稳定性方面存在困难，并且参数高效的微调（LoRA）在小市场中表现良好，但在大型实例中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 即使表现最好的模型在处理大型市场中的不稳定性时也面临困难，通常无法识别阻塞对或迭代执行算法。参数高效的微调（LoRA）在小市场中显著提高了性能，但在大型实例中未能带来类似改进，这表明需要更复杂的策略来提高LLMs处理更大上下文输入的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估范式依赖于粗略的整体答案准确性，不足以评估LLMs的真实能力。

Method: 通过将人类推理过程分为三个阶段：问题理解、问题解决和解决方案总结，设计了一个包含9个细粒度评估维度的评估框架。

Result: CogMath揭示了7个主流LLMs的数学能力被高估了30%-40%，并定位了它们在特定阶段/维度的优势和劣势。

Conclusion: CogMath评估了LLMs的数学能力，揭示了7个主流LLMs的数学能力被高估了30%-40%，并提供了深入了解以增强其推理能力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 将自然语言中的复杂空间、数学和条件约束融入规划问题，解决这些约束难以转换为正式描述的问题。

Method: 提出STPR框架，使用LLMs将约束（以“不要做什么”的指令形式表达）转换为可执行的Python函数。

Result: STPR确保了多个约束和场景下的完全合规性，同时具有较短的运行时间。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: 实验表明，LLMs在生成高质量的ShEx模式方面具有强大的潜力，为大型知识图谱的可扩展、自动化模式生成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Motivation: 农业正受到人工智能、机器学习和知识表示技术的重大变革的推动。然而，当前的农业智能系统通常缺乏情境理解、可解释性和适应性，尤其是对于资源有限的小农户来说。通用的大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然强大，但通常缺乏农业领域的特定知识和情境推理，这对于农业的实际决策支持是必要的。它们往往产生过于通用或不切实际的推荐，适用于现实世界的应用。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了OpenAg，这是一个旨在推进农业人工智能（AGI）的全面框架。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Conclusion: DeePoly为解决偏微分方程提供了一种新的解决方案，该方法结合了深度神经网络和多项式基函数的优点，提高了求解精度和效率。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1模型在批评准确性方面具有显著优势，提高了自动化GUI的成功率和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了CHANCERY，一个针对公司治理推理的基准，用于测试模型在判断高管/董事会/股东提议的行动是否符合公司治理章程方面的推理能力。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,

Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Motivation: Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型的基准评估结果受多种因素影响，导致结果波动较大。

Method: 对Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型进行实证评估。

Result: 发现Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型的基准评估结果存在显著波动，并观察到类似现象在其他开源推理模型中。

Conclusion: 我们主张建立一个更严格的标准来评估模型性能，并展示了我们对Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型的实证评估。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Motivation: 医疗人工智能系统缺乏系统领域专业知识整合，可能损害诊断可靠性。

Method: 开发了一个基于本体的框架，用于骨病诊断，包括分层神经网络架构、本体增强视觉问答系统和多模态深度学习模型。

Result: 框架通过系统知识数字化、标准化医学术语映射和模块化架构设计保持临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于本体的框架，用于骨病诊断，引入了三个理论贡献，并通过标准化结构和可重用组件展示了扩展到其他疾病的潜力。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Result: 在多样化的安全关键连续控制任务上实现了稳健的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的基于模型的强化学习框架，该框架同时优化任务性能和安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Result: 在经典控制任务和倒立摆任务中，该方法在大多数情况下成功识别出最优或高性能的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将连续观察向量直接映射到连续动作向量，使大型语言模型（LLMs）能够控制具身代理。在经典控制任务和倒立摆任务中，该方法在大多数情况下成功识别出最优或高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Conclusion: DiffLogic CA结合了NCA和DLGN，实现了可微分逻辑门电路，能够学习细胞自动机的局部更新规则，并生成各种复杂图案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Conclusion: 提供了理论架构和模块化架构，以在资源波动环境中部署自主代理。

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Result: 实验表明，RAG-UAV框架可显著提高LLMs在UAV领域的数学推理能力，提高准确率并减少错误。

Conclusion: RAG-UAV框架可显著提高LLMs在UAV领域的数学推理能力，提高准确率并减少错误。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有自我改进方法存在限制，需要内在元认知学习。

Method: 从人类元认知中获取灵感，提出一个包含三个组件的框架：元认知知识、元认知规划和元认知评估。

Result: 分析了现有自我改进代理，发现它们主要依赖外部的元认知机制，并提出了内在元认知学习的解决方案。

Conclusion: 有效自我改进需要内在元认知学习，我们提出一个包含三个组件的框架：元认知知识、元认知规划和元认知评估。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Motivation: 现有的搜索方法在处理不同难度的任务时缺乏适应性和灵活性。

Method: LLM-First Search (LFS) 是一种新型 LLM 自主导航搜索方法，通过自我引导探索来控制搜索过程。

Result: LFS 在 Countdown 和 Sudoku 任务上优于 Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth First Search (ToT-BFS)、Best First Search (BestFS) 和 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)。

Conclusion: LLM-First Search (LFS) 在更具挑战性的任务上表现更好，计算效率更高，并且可以更好地扩展到更强的模型和更大的计算预算。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 如何通过生成更多标记在推理时提高大型推理模型（LRMs）的性能，但通常会在简单问题上浪费计算。

Method: 介绍自适应长度惩罚（ALP），这是一个强化学习目标，根据每个提示的解决率调整生成长度。

Result: 使用ALP对DeepScaleR-1.5B进行后训练，平均标记使用量减少50%，而性能没有显著下降。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair

Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple

Conclusion: 本文通过研究类间特征归因，对对抗训练（AT）进行了新的视角分析，揭示了AT机制的新发现，并提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Conclusion: 提供概念模型的风险和限制的全面调查，重点关注缓解这些挑战的常见挑战和架构选择，并讨论提高其可靠性的最新进展和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Result: 通过在多个数据集上的大量实验，证明了MLNs可以显著提高现有OOD检测器的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MLNs可以显著提高现有OOD检测器的性能，同时保持计算效率。此外，我们还介绍了一种从数据集中学习OOD检测逻辑约束的简单算法，并展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决当前方法中将时间仅视为输入参数，而不是模拟变形发展的序列性质的局限性。

Method: 该架构利用Transformer的自注意力机制来捕捉历史蠕变模式中的长距离依赖关系，并实现了一个三流注意力框架，包括时间注意力、特征注意力和批量注意力。

Result: 在160天的标准化每日测量数据集上，该架构实现了卓越的性能，平均绝对百分比误差为1.63%，R2值为0.999。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的Triple Attention Transformer架构，用于预测时间依赖性混凝土蠕变，显著优于传统模型和现有机器学习方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Conclusion: SafeSteer方法简单有效，表明简单的技术在激活引导中往往优于更复杂的技术。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Conclusion: PGT 可以在反向传播不适用或不可能的情况下达到与标准反向传播方法相当的性能。PGT 是将物理水库集成到更深层神经网络架构并实现显著能源效率提升的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUC-G4是一个用于压缩深度神经网络增量验证的新框架，通过高证明重用率和显著加速验证时间，为压缩神经网络的实用应用提供了有希望的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Conclusion: DrSR显著提高了有效方程率，并在准确度、泛化能力和搜索效率方面始终优于传统和基于LLM的方法。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including

While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data

First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Conclusion: 研究发现，IWL模型自然地诱导出对传递推理的泛化偏差，而ICL模型在仅基于相邻项目训练的情况下无法泛化传递推理。此外，当在上下文线性回归任务上预训练时，Transformer成功表现出上下文可泛化的传递推理。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法在理论上优于现有方法，并通过模拟结果证明了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

*N Guerin,M Nakhla,A Dehoux,J L Loyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合建模方法，以增强露天采矿中运矿车队运力的短期预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测运矿车队的短期运力对于露天采矿至关重要，因为天气变化、机械故障和可变人员可用性会引入重大运营不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种深度学习框架，结合实际运营记录和模拟故障场景，评估了XGBoost回归器和LSTM网络两种架构。

Result: XGBoost回归器实现了14.3%的中值绝对误差（MedAE），LSTM网络实现了15.1%的MedAE。

Conclusion: 提出了一种混合建模方法，将模拟故障数据、班次规划特征等与实际运营记录结合，为动态不确定条件下的主动、数据驱动车队管理提供全面决策支持工具。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

Result: 提出了基于软log的熵和散度，用于构建在闭区间上具有一致值的信息度量。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种四步过程，用于提高下一代集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Conclusion: RedRFT旨在简化并标准化基于RFT的渗透测试的实施和评估。

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

Conclusion: YOTO方法通过一次训练自动优化学习模型的损失权重超参数，在3D估计和语义分割任务上优于常用的网格搜索模型。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上进行了实验，表明半层具有潜力。

Conclusion: 通过使用半层，可以在减少参数数量的同时实现合理的准确性，这得益于随机连接的正则化效应。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation

to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based

boundedness and modularity

reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

Conclusion: iS-QL提高了无目标方法在各种设置下的样本效率，同时具有较小的内存占用和可比较的训练时间。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Result: 证明了CL和NSCL损失之间的差距，并引入了新的少量样本错误界限。

Conclusion: 证明了CL和NSCL损失之间的差距随着语义类别的增加而消失，并引入了新的少量样本错误界限。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that

Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Conclusion: 研究发现了一个新的第三阶段“反理解”，即测试准确率下降而训练准确率保持完美。这种后期崩溃与已知的预理解和理解阶段不同，并且不会被其他提出的理解进度指标检测到。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Result: 提出了一种框架，该框架在重要区域提高了预测准确性，并区分了不同重要区域。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于选择性匹配损失函数的框架，用于在重要区域提高预测准确性，并区分不同重要区域。该框架在多种应用中具有优势，包括预测停留时间、检索、排名和大型语言模型的微调对齐。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Conclusion: ODXU在NIDS中表现出色，优于传统神经网络模型。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service

categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

Conclusion: COSMOS可以高效地预测LLM的适应结果，平均降低计算成本92.72%，在资源密集型场景中高达98.71%，同时保持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Motivation: None

Method: None

Result: None

Conclusion: None

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Method: HALoS是一个分层异步优化框架，通过引入本地参数服务器和全局参数服务器来减少区域间通信成本，提高硬件利用率。

Result: HALoS在地理分布语言模型训练中实现了比同步基准快7.5倍的收敛速度，并比现有异步方法快2.1倍。同时，保持了模型质量。

Conclusion: HALoS通过引入本地参数服务器和全局参数服务器，解决了地理分布加速器带来的通信成本和硬件利用率不均的问题，实现了大规模语言模型的快速收敛和模型质量保持。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Result: Neural MJD在合成和真实世界数据集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Neural MJD模型在时间序列预测中优于现有方法。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的算法，通过聚类输入数据并使用私有计算中位数的方法来聚合下一个标记统计信息，从而提高了生成文本的质量和隐私保护。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在有限的内存预算内容纳多个大型模型。

Method: StatsMerging利用奇异值分解（SVD）的奇异值来捕获特定任务的权重分布，并使用轻量级学习器StatsMergeLearner来模拟特定任务的预训练模型的权重分布。

Result: StatsMerging提供了三种关键优势：独特地利用奇异值分解（SVD）的奇异值，使用轻量级学习器StatsMergeLearner来模拟权重分布，以及引入了特定任务的教师蒸馏。

Conclusion: StatsMerging在整体准确度、泛化到未见任务和对抗图像质量变化方面的鲁棒性方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决可迁移学习中的模型和样本比较问题，提高预训练效率。

Method: 推导基于密集测量的全缩放定律，用于模型和样本的比较，以决定哪种预训练过程更可取。

Result: 为CLIP和MaMMUT两种语言视觉学习程序推导了全缩放定律，证明了MaMMUT在规模和样本效率方面优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: 通过推导缩放定律，可以对模型和数据进行跨尺度比较，从而避免仅基于单一参考尺度测量得出的误导性结论，为开放基础模型和数据集的系统比较和改进铺平道路。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Method: 通过理论和实证研究，分析图对称化对解释准确性的影响，并证明保留方向语义的重要性。

Result: 证明了保留方向语义的重要性，并强调了在安全关键应用中实现方向感知GNN可解释性的必要性。

Conclusion: 通过理论和实证研究，证明保留方向语义可以显著提高解释质量，确保为人类决策者提供更忠实的信息。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的EBM训练方法，使用双向边界来稳定训练并提高样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免最小化下界带来的不稳定性。

Method: 提出使用双向边界来训练EBM，并研究四种不同的边界。

Result: 提出了一种新的EBM训练方法，并证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 使用双向边界稳定了EBM训练，并产生了高质量的密度估计和样本生成。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Motivation: 在现实世界中部署这些系统时，我们需要选择能够最大化任务成功并最小化风险的代理组合，其中风险包括安全性、公平性和隐私等方面的要求。这还要求仔细分析代理组合的低概率（尾部）行为。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between

inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Conclusion: 本文挑战了过度平滑是GNN独有问题的先前的观点，并证明了跳过连接和归一化等经典方法可以成功堆叠深层GNN层而不降低性能。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种PML特征选择方法，通过考虑数据集的两个重要特征：标签关系的噪声抵抗性和标签连通性，有效地解决了维度灾难问题，提高了模型分类性能。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 联邦学习中，由于用户差异和数据模态的多样性，单模型的使用不切实际。部分模型个性化可以解决这些问题，但可能会加剧客户端漂移，降低联邦学习算法的有效性和效率。

Result: FedAPM框架在四个异构和多模态数据集上实现了更快、更准确的收敛，测试精度、F1分数和AUC分别平均提高了12.3%、16.4%和18.0%，同时需要更少的通信轮次。

Conclusion: FedAPM框架通过使用显式估计的拉格朗日乘子，在收敛性方面比其他联邦学习框架更稳定和高效。在四个异构和多模态数据集上进行的实验表明，FedAPM在测试精度、F1分数和AUC方面均优于SOTA方法，平均提高了12.3%、16.4%和18.0%，同时需要更少的通信轮次。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Conclusion: 仔细的集成设计和重新训练策略选择可以产生准确、稳健且成本效益高的预测，适用于现实世界应用。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: 过参数化模型训练损失对泛化性能的洞察有限，直接在神经网络中强制执行平滑性具有挑战性。

Method: DIPNet通过在每个层将输入投影到可学习的分布来提高泛化性能。

Result: DIPNet降低了局部平滑度指标和网络Lipschitz常数，提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: DIPNet通过将输入投影到可学习的分布来提高泛化性能，并已在多种架构和任务中得到验证，包括ViTs、LLMs、ResNet和MLPs。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卫星数据的机器学习框架，用于分类孟加拉国的干旱情况，并成功地将其分为不同级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统干旱指数如SPI和PDSI往往忽略了土壤水分和温度等关键因素，限制了它们的分辨率。此外，目前应用于干旱预测的机器学习模型在孟加拉国的背景下研究不足，缺乏对多地区卫星数据的综合集成。

Method: 提出了一种基于卫星数据的机器学习框架，该框架使用无监督算法（如K-means和贝叶斯高斯混合）进行聚类，然后使用分类模型（如KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯）进行分类。

Result: 该框架成功地分类了干旱严重程度的不同级别，并显示出地区间干旱脆弱性的显著差异。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于卫星数据的机器学习框架，以分类孟加拉国的干旱情况，并成功地将其分为不同级别。然而，它显示出地区间干旱脆弱性的显著差异，这突出了机器学习模型在识别和预测干旱条件方面的能力。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Motivation: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL), have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training implicit generative models. We aim to introduce a new likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models.

Method: We introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models. It interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We also develop a theoretical framework that interprets d_K as an L2-projection of the density ratio q onto a Bernstein polynomial basis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections.

Result: The dual-ISL method is shown to be effective in training implicit generative models. It converges more rapidly, delivers smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods. It also provides an explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL is a novel and effective method for training implicit generative models. It has theoretical advantages and practical benefits over classical ISL and other leading methods.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Conclusion: 我们提出了基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法，这些算法能够在保持原始模型忠实度的情况下忘记数据，并且比以前的算法如梯度手术快几个数量级。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

TL;DR: MGRPO通过两个层级的GRPO，实现自纠正循环，提升LLMs推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO缺乏中间监督导致探索动态效率低，需要改进。

Method: MGRPO采用两个层级的GRPO，第一层生成初始响应，第二层识别并纠正错误。

Result: MGRPO在数学推理基准测试中显著优于标准GRPO。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过自纠正循环提升LLMs推理能力，实现更稳定的训练。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的log-linear attention机制，提高了Transformer的效率和表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决Transformer中注意力机制的二次计算和线性内存复杂性问题。

Method: 通过将固定大小的隐藏状态替换为对数增长的一组隐藏状态来开发log-linear attention。

Result: log-linear attention在Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet等架构上表现出色，优于其线性时间变体。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为log-linear attention的新机制，它平衡了线性注意力机制的效率和softmax注意力机制的表达能力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个名为OpenGT的综合基准，用于评估图Transformer的性能，并揭示了GTs在不同任务和数据集上的关键洞察。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

Conclusion: 我们改进了关于重尾奖励的随机线性赌博机的最小-最大后悔度的上下界。我们提出了一种新的基于消除的算法，并给出了依赖$d$的上界和下界。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Conclusion: 揭示了两种方法之间的深层结构关系，并为VQ QUBO公式的权重参数的几何解释提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Conclusion: 这篇论文的主要结论是什么？这项工作的意义是什么？

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Motivation: LLMs在熟悉环境中的结构推理方面存在困难，表明标准的微调流程可能是在灌输特定领域的启发式策略，而不是培养通用思维策略。

Method: 提出一个“玩耍以学习”的框架，通过七个定制的逻辑谜题的强化学习来微调LLMs，培养不同的推理技能，并使用可验证的奖励来提供基于谜题正确性的二进制反馈。

Result: 在多个数学基准上，该训练方法显著提高了模型的性能，尤其是在需要多步推理的中等难度问题。

Conclusion: 强化学习通过逻辑谜题重新塑造了LLMs的内部推理，使它们能够进行更稳健和组合的泛化，而不依赖于特定任务的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway

EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

TL;DR: 开发了GPDSSM来提高髋关节发育不良的早期诊断，与现有方法相比，该方法提高了分类精度并节省了临床医生的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究早期诊断髋关节发育不良以减少髋关节骨关节炎（OA）的风险。

Method: 开发了一种半自动分类发育不良的管道，该管道使用患者的髋关节体积CT扫描和最少量的临床标注的标志点。结合高斯过程潜在变量模型与测地变形来创建统计形状模型，称为高斯过程测地变形统计形状模型（GPDSSM）。

Result: GPDSSM有效地区分了发育不良样本和对照组，同时突出了潜在表面显示出发育不良变化的区域。与基于角度的方法相比，GPDSSM提高了分类精度（AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%），并且可以为临床医生节省时间，无需手动测量角度和解释2D扫描以寻找发育不良的可能标志物。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化人机交互和更好地使自动化系统与工业5.0以人为中心、可持续和有弹性的原则保持一致。

Result: 通过意图分解、代理编排和自主决策，实现了预测性维护场景的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力减少技术障碍并实现可扩展的意图驱动自动化。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant是一种高效且准确的大型语言模型量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在推理时需要大量的计算和能量，而传统的量化方法会降低性能。

Method: FPTQuant引入了四个新的变换：合并前的RoPE变换、合并变换、MLP块内的合并缩放变换和动态缩放变换。这些变换利用了标准变换操作的内禀相关性和独立性，以保持模型功能并使中间激活分布更适合量化。

Result: FPTQuant实现了静态INT4量化，在速度上比FP快3.9倍，同时保持了与之前大多数方法相当甚至更高的准确性。

Conclusion: FPTQuant通过引入四个新的、轻量级的、具有表达性的函数保留变换，实现了对大型语言模型（LLMs）的量化，同时保持了模型的功能并提高了效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Result: None

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Conclusion: CREAM是一种有效的概念瓶颈模型，可以提高模型推理和任务性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: MPP编码具有形状中心性和连续性，可以用于根据几何特征区分空间对象，并且可以以高精度捕获成对的空间关系。MPP编码在所有情况下都优于基于光栅化的替代方法。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Motivation: PLL在现实应用中存在挑战，需要更通用的模型。

Result: 发现当前PLL方法在基础模型使用、性能稳定性、适应性等方面存在优势，但也受限于模型选择和调整策略。

Conclusion: 当前PLL方法存在局限性，需要开发更通用的PLL模型。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Conclusion: TIMING通过引入时间感知，提高了IG在时间序列XAI中的性能，并在合成和真实世界的时间序列基准测试中优于现有基线。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Motivation: 为了解决现有节点嵌入方法在处理新节点时的局限性，提出了iN2V方法。

Method: iN2V方法结合了后处理过程来计算训练过程中未见过的节点的嵌入，并对原始N2V训练过程进行了修改，以准备后处理过程的嵌入。

Result: iN2V在几个基准数据集上进行了实验，证明了iN2V是使归纳嵌入应用于归纳设置的有效方法。使用iN2V嵌入将节点分类平均提高了1分，在某些数据集和未见节点数量下，提高了6分。

Conclusion: iN2V是一种将归纳嵌入应用于归纳设置的有效方法，可以结合其他嵌入方法，是一种通用的归纳节点表示学习方法。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Motivation: 神经网络难以解释，线性模型可解释性更好。

Method: 提出NIMO模型，结合神经网络和线性模型的优势。

Result: 提高了预测精度，同时保持了线性系数的可解释性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

Result: 我们的实验表明，我们的初始化方法提高了状态空间模型对噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的初始化方法提高了状态空间模型对噪声的鲁棒性，无论是在训练还是推理阶段。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Result: 该方法在性能和训练效率方面优于或等于最先进的SIVI方法，并且具有更低的梯度方差和良性的函数空间偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和训练效率方面优于或等于最先进的SIVI方法。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究了生成扩散和连续状态关联记忆模型之间的联系，并描述了由此产生的关联记忆的通用特性。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Method: TreeRPO算法通过树采样估计各种推理步骤的奖励数学期望，直接通过采样过程估计这些奖励，并基于树采样期间生成的步骤级组计算奖励。

Result: TreeRPO算法显著提高了Qwen-2.5-Math在测试基准上的平均Pass@1准确率，从19.0%提高到35.5%，同时比GRPO性能高出2.9%，平均响应长度减少18.1%。

Conclusion: 我们的TreeRPO算法显著提高了Qwen-2.5-Math在测试基准上的平均Pass@1准确率，从19.0%提高到35.5%，同时比GRPO性能高出2.9%，平均响应长度减少18.1%，展示了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Result: LPMT在实例检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，LPMT在实例检索任务中是有效的。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Result: SHARP在四个数据集上实现了优于基线的方法，并在全局和度级别上均表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: SHARP通过Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR)对比损失缓解了节点分类任务中的度偏，并在多个数据集上实现了优于基线的方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: 提出了一个新的基于核Hilbert空间框架的分布式鲁棒核学习算法，并通过严格的收敛性分析，证明了算法的鲁棒性和收敛性。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的框架，用于包含KernelSHAP和相关估计器，并证明了所有估计器的强非渐近理论保证。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长上下文推理方面存在性能瓶颈。

Method: Diagonal Batching通过并行处理RMT的各个部分来提高性能。

Result: Diagonal Batching在LLaMA-1B模型上实现了3.3倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching是RMT在长上下文应用中的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种名为PTSD的新方法，该方法结合了并行调和和扩散模型的优势，显著提高了目标评估效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管近年来在设计神经采样器方面取得了显著进展，但在目标评估效率方面，它们仍然落后于最先进的MCMC方法——并行调和（PT）。另一方面，与训练良好的神经采样器相比，PT只能产生相关的样本，并且每当需要新样本时都需要重新运行，这带来了相当大的计算成本。为了解决这些缺点，我们提出了一种新的采样方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为PTSD（逐步调和采样器）的新方法，该方法通过逐步在温度下训练扩散模型来利用PT的优点，从而提高神经采样器的训练效果。我们还介绍了一种将高温扩散模型结合起来的新方法，以生成近似低温样本，这些样本使用MCMC进行最小化改进，并用于训练下一个扩散模型。PTSD可以在温度级别之间有效地重用样本信息，同时生成混合良好、无相关的样本。

Result: 我们的方法显著提高了目标评估效率，优于基于扩散的神经采样器。

Conclusion: PTSD方法在提高目标评估效率方面优于现有的神经采样器和MCMC方法。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Result: 实验表明，最佳测试时训练可以降低语言模型的困惑度，提高下游基准性能。然而，这也需要额外的浮点运算开销。

Conclusion: 通过在神经网络内部解决序列优化问题，提高了测试时的计算量，从而提高了性能。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Result: 使用MNIST在控制环境中评估了稀疏自编码器（SAEs），发现MP-SAE能够有效提取相关特征。

Conclusion: 当前浅层架构隐式依赖于近似正交性假设，限制了提取相关特征的能力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: 提出Fast-DataShapley，一种高效的训练方法，可显著提高Shapley值的计算效率和解释器的训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人工智能行业中，训练数据和版权的价值至关重要。服务平台应保护数据提供者的合法权益并公平奖励他们的贡献。Shapley值是评估贡献的有力工具，在理论上优于其他方法，但其计算开销随着数据提供者数量的增加而呈指数增长。近期基于Shapley值的研究试图通过近似算法来减轻计算复杂性。然而，它们需要为每个测试样本重新训练，导致成本高昂。

Method: 提出Fast-DataShapley，一种单次训练方法，利用Shapley值的加权最小二乘特征来训练一个可重用解释模型，具有实时推理速度。对于新的测试样本，无需重新训练即可计算训练数据的Shapley值。此外，提出三种具有理论保证的方法从两个方面减少训练开销：近似计算效用函数和组计算训练数据。分析时间复杂度以展示方法的效率。

Result: 在各种图像数据集上的实验评估表明，与基线相比，性能提高了2.5倍以上，解释器的训练速度可以提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 为了解决在没有明确结构先验的情况下，机器学习技术在模拟动态系统时难以泛化的问题。

Method: 提出了一种用于水库计算机的多个轨迹训练方案，该方案支持在一系列不连续的时间序列上训练，从而有效地利用可用训练数据。然后将该训练方案应用于多稳态动态系统，并展示出从单个吸引子盆地轨迹训练的RC可以捕获在完全未观察到的盆地中的系统行为，从而实现域外泛化。

Conclusion: 水库计算机在没有结构先验的情况下能够泛化到未探索的状态空间区域，这表明它是一个有效的数据驱动建模框架。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Method: SAILOR通过学习搜索，结合世界模型和奖励模型，实现错误后的恢复行为。

Result: SAILOR在视觉操作任务中优于基于BC的扩散策略，并能识别细微的失败和抵御奖励黑客攻击。

Conclusion: SAILOR通过学习搜索和组合世界模型和奖励模型，能够在测试时规划匹配专家结果，即使在出现错误后也能恢复。在视觉操作任务中，SAILOR优于基于BC的扩散策略。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Conclusion: 本研究建立了两种重复采样策略之间的分离结果，并展示了自纠正方法与验证器反馈的表达式结果，最后通过实证验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

TL;DR: SiftAttention 是一种新的近似注意力方法，通过减少内存带宽使用来提高 GPU 上的语言模型推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于内存带宽限制，高效地在 GPU 上使用大型语言模型进行推理仍然具有挑战性。

Method: SiftAttention 通过基于阈值的逐元素过滤操作来替换 top-$k$ 步骤，并动态估计每个提示的阈值值。

Result: SiftAttention 保持了模型质量，同时减少了数据在 HBM 和 SRAM 之间的移动。

Conclusion: SiftAttention 在保持模型质量的同时，比现有近似注意力方法减少了内存带宽使用。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLMs）强化学习（RL）调优的数据效率问题，本文提出了两种技术：困难度目标在线数据选择和回放。

Method: 提出了两种技术：困难度目标在线数据选择和回放。困难度目标在线数据选择通过引入自适应困难度来引导在线数据选择，优先选择中等难度的题目。回放机制则通过重用最近的回放来降低每一步的计算量。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为grafting的新方法，通过编辑预训练的扩散变换器来探索新的模型架构设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计模型架构需要做出选择，如选择操作（例如，注意力、卷积）和配置（例如，深度、宽度）。然而，评估这些决策对模型质量的影响需要昂贵的预训练，限制了架构研究。受新软件在现有代码上构建的启发，我们提出：是否可以使用预训练模型来研究新的架构设计？

Method: 提出了一种名为grafting的简单方法，用于编辑预训练的扩散变换器（DiTs），在较小的计算预算下实现新的架构。通过分析激活行为和注意力局部性，我们构建了一个基于DiT-XL/2设计的测试平台，以研究grafting对模型质量的影响。使用该平台，我们通过grafting开发了一系列混合设计：用门控卷积、局部注意力和线性注意力替换softmax注意力，用可变扩展比和卷积变体替换MLPs。

Result: 许多混合设计在预训练计算量小于2%的情况下实现了良好的质量（FID：2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2）。然后，通过grafting将文本到图像模型（PixArt-Sigma）进行grafting，实现了1.43x的速度提升，GenEval分数下降了不到2%。最后，我们通过grafting将DiT-XL/2重构，将每个连续的变换器块对转换为并行块。这减少了模型深度2倍，并且比其他同等深度的模型质量更好（FID：2.77）。

Conclusion: 通过grafting预训练的DiTs，可以探索新的扩散模型设计，从操作替换到架构重构的编辑范围。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

Motivation: 在Transformer LLMs中，生成成本受KV缓存大小限制，而不是生成标记的数量。

Method: 提出了一种名为动态内存稀疏化（DMS）的新方法，该方法通过延迟标记删除，隐式合并表示并保留关键信息，以实现KV缓存的稀疏化。

Result: 在多个LLM系列上展示了DMS在推理时间超缩放中的有效性，提高了推理的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过压缩KV缓存，可以在相同的计算预算内生成更多标记，从而进一步提高推理的准确性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统封闭系统中无法持续实现开放式进化的问题。

Result: Spore.fun实验展示了基于区块链的智能体在开放环境中实现自主进化的可能性。

Conclusion: 探讨基于无许可计算基础的‘开放’人工生命系统是否最终能够实现持续进化创新的目标。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

### [181] [HASHIRU: Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent Resource Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04255)
*Kunal Pai,Parth Shah,Harshil Patel*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HASHIRU是一个增强MAS灵活性和资源效率的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前框架缺乏灵活性、资源意识、模型多样性和自主工具创建。

Method: HASHIRU是一个新的MAS框架，它通过动态管理“CEO”代理和基于任务需求和资源约束的“员工”代理来增强灵活性、资源效率和适应性。

Result: HASHIRU在学术论文审查（成功率为58%）、安全评估（在JailbreakBench子集上达到100%）和复杂推理（在GSM8K、JEEBench和SVAMP任务上优于Gemini 2.0 Flash）等方面表现出色。

Conclusion: HASHIRU通过动态分层控制、资源感知混合智能和自主功能扩展，为更健壮、高效和可适应的MAS提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous
Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack
flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation.
This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent
Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource
efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically
managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and
resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes
smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger
models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team
stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes
autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like
academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a
JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash
on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate
HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via
autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.
HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable
MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence,
and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available
at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRU and
https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRUBench respectively, and a live demo is
available at https://hashiruagentx-hashiruai.hf.space upon request.

### [182] [CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265)
*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 这项工作提出了一种新的信用分配方法CORA，用于解决合作多智能体强化学习中的信用分配问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享全局优势通常会导致子优化策略更新，因为它没有考虑到智能体的不同贡献。许多方法考虑了全局或个人贡献的信用分配，但在许多方法中，对联盟层面的详细分析仍然不足。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在合作多智能体强化学习（MARL）中的信用分配问题。CORA通过边际贡献评估联盟优势，并使用合作博弈论的核心解分解优势，确保联盟理性。实验表明，CORA在具有多个局部最优的任务中优于强基线。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决独立模型在需要记忆、推理、实时定位和多模态理解的任务中的局限性，以及CAIS领域缺乏统一的分析、分类和评估框架的问题。

Method: 本文采用了一种多维度的分类法，分析了四种基础范式，并回顾了代表性系统，比较了设计权衡，并总结了评估方法。

Result: 本文提出了CAIS的概念，提出了多维度的分类法，分析了四种基础范式，并识别了关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文定义了CAIS的概念，提出了基于组件角色和编排策略的多维分类法，并分析了四种基础范式：检索增强生成（RAG）、LLM代理、多模态LLM（MLLMs）和以编排为中心的架构。此外，还回顾了代表性系统，比较了设计权衡，并总结了这些范式中的评估方法。最后，识别了关键挑战，包括可扩展性、互操作性、基准测试和协调，并概述了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large
language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents,
tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in
tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal
understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by
composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing
adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented,
lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this
survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy
based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four
foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents,
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review
representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation
methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key
challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and
coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey
aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation
for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of
system-level artificial intelligence.

*Maxime Toquebiau,Jae-Yun Jun,Faïz Benamar,Nicolas Bredeche*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 通过将结构化语言集成到多智能体学习中，提高了学习和协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数先前的工作都集中在从头开始开发的自发通信协议上，这通常导致效率低下或不可解释的系统。

Method: 提出一个框架，其中智能体不仅被训练去行动，还被训练去产生和解释他们观察到的自然语言描述。

Result: 与我们的方法训练的智能体在各种任务上优于传统的自发通信基线。

Conclusion: 将结构化语言集成到多智能体学习中是有效的，这开辟了更可解释和强大的多智能体系统的新途径。

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on
emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in
inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in
natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined
language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We
propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to
produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This
language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication
between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents
trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines
across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to
more informative internal representations, better generalization to new
partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into
multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable
multi-agent systems.

### [187] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，能够在游戏表现和与人类玩家的融合方面与人类玩家匹敌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界环境是异步的，而目前的LLMs主要用于同步通信。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，可以决定说什么以及何时说。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和与人类玩家的融合方面与人类玩家匹敌。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLMs在现实人类群体环境中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法准确理解复杂的3D场景和动态推理指令指示的交互位置。

Method: 提出RoboRefer，一个3D感知VLM，通过整合解耦但专门的深度编码器通过监督微调(SFT)实现精确的空间理解，并通过强化微调(RFT)推进多步空间推理。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均成功率为89.6%。RFT训练的RoboRefer在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均准确率超过了所有其他基线，甚至比Gemini-2.5-Pro高出17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在空间理解方面实现了最先进的性能，在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均准确率超过了所有其他基线，甚至比Gemini-2.5-Pro高出17.4%。RoboRefer可以集成到各种控制策略中，以执行不同机器人在杂乱的真实场景中的长期、动态任务。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial
sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial
measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to
as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a
wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to
deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on
edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and
implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several
state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of
cuVSLAM.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新的方法SPARTA，用于从点云中估计接近角度条件可通行性，并在模拟和硬件上都取得了成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决越野自主导航中地形可通行性依赖于车辆状态的问题，以及从点云中学习这种交互需要大量和多样化的训练数据集，并且在规划期间由于重复模型推理而计算效率低下的问题。

Method: SPARTA方法通过在1-Sphere上输出平滑的分析函数来预测任何接近角度的风险分布，该函数由傅里叶基函数组成，具有周期性和平滑性，有利于泛化。

Result: SPARTA在模拟平台和硬件上都取得了良好的效果，在40米巨石场的通过成功率达到了91%，高于基线方法的73%。

Conclusion: 我们提出了SPARTA，一种从点云中估计接近角度条件可通行性的方法。SPARTA在模拟和硬件上都表现出色，证明了其在现实世界场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in remote, unstructured environments must
adapt to new, unpredictable terrains that can change rapidly during operation.
In such scenarios, a critical challenge becomes estimating the robot's dynamics
on changing terrain in order to enable reliable, accurate navigation and
planning. We present a novel online adaptation approach for terrain-aware
dynamics modeling and planning using function encoders. Our approach
efficiently adapts to new terrains at runtime using limited online data without
retraining or fine-tuning. By learning a set of neural network basis functions
that span the robot dynamics on diverse terrains, we enable rapid online
adaptation to new, unseen terrains and environments as a simple least-squares
calculation. We demonstrate our approach for terrain adaptation in a
Unity-based robotics simulator and show that the downstream controller has
better empirical performance due to higher accuracy of the learned model. This
leads to fewer collisions with obstacles while navigating in cluttered
environments as compared to a neural ODE baseline.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids

approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

Abstract: Limbless creatures can crawl on flat surfaces by deforming their bodies and
interacting with asperities on the ground, offering a biological blueprint for
designing efficient limbless robots. Inspired by this natural locomotion, we
present a soft robot capable of navigating complex terrains using a combination
of rectilinear motion and asymmetric steering gaits. The robot is made of a
pair of antagonistic inflatable soft actuators covered with a flexible kirigami
skin with asymmetric frictional properties. The robot's rectilinear locomotion
is achieved through cyclic inflation of internal chambers with precise phase
shifts, enabling forward progression. Steering is accomplished using an
asymmetric gait, allowing for both in-place rotation and wide turns. To
validate its mobility in obstacle-rich environments, we tested the robot in an
arena with coarse substrates and multiple obstacles. Real-time feedback from
onboard proximity sensors, integrated with a human-machine interface (HMI),
allowed adaptive control to avoid collisions. This study highlights the
potential of bioinspired soft robots for applications in confined or
unstructured environments, such as search-and-rescue operations, environmental
monitoring, and industrial inspections.

Abstract: This study presents a transformer-based deep learning framework for the
long-horizon prediction of full lower-limb joint angles and joint moments using
surface electromyography (sEMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals.
Two separate Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs) were designed: one for
kinematic prediction and one for kinetic prediction. The model was developed
with real-time application in mind, using only wearable sensors suitable for
outside-laboratory use. Two prediction horizons were considered to evaluate
short- and long-term performance. The network achieved high accuracy in both
tasks, with Spearman correlation coefficients exceeding 0.96 and R-squared
scores above 0.92 across all joints. Notably, the model consistently
outperformed a recent benchmark method in joint angle prediction, reducing RMSE
errors by an order of magnitude. The results confirmed the complementary role
of sEMG and IMU signals in capturing both kinematic and kinetic information.
This work demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models for real-time,

Abstract: Aquatic organisms are known for their ability to generate efficient
propulsion with low energy expenditure. While existing research has sought to
leverage bio-inspired structures to reduce energy costs in underwater robotics,
the crucial role of control policies in enhancing efficiency has often been
overlooked. In this study, we optimize the motion of a bio-mimetic robotic fish
using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to maximize propulsion efficiency and
minimize energy consumption. Our novel DRL approach incorporates extended
pressure perception, a transformer model processing sequences of observations,
and a policy transfer scheme. Notably, significantly improved training
stability and speed within our approach allow for end-to-end training of the
robotic fish. This enables agiler responses to hydrodynamic environments and
possesses greater optimization potential compared to pre-defined motion pattern
controls. Our experiments are conducted on a serially connected rigid robotic
fish in a free stream with a Reynolds number of 6000 using computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations. The DRL-trained policies yield impressive results,
demonstrating both high efficiency and propulsion. The policies also showcase
the agent's embodiment, skillfully utilizing its body structure and engaging
with surrounding fluid dynamics, as revealed through flow analysis. This study
provides valuable insights into the bio-mimetic underwater robots optimization
through DRL training, capitalizing on their structural advantages, and
ultimately contributing to more efficient underwater propulsion systems.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Planning with learned dynamics models offers a promising approach toward
real-world, long-horizon manipulation, particularly in nonprehensile settings
such as pushing or rolling, where accurate analytical models are difficult to
obtain. Although learning-based methods hold promise, collecting training data
can be costly and inefficient, as it often relies on randomly sampled
interactions that are not necessarily the most informative. To address this
challenge, we propose ActivePusher, a novel framework that combines
residual-physics modeling with kernel-based uncertainty-driven active learning
to focus data acquisition on the most informative skill parameters.
Additionally, ActivePusher seamlessly integrates with model-based kinodynamic
planners, leveraging uncertainty estimates to bias control sampling toward more
reliable actions. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and real-world
environments and demonstrate that it improves data efficiency and planning
success rates compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于SDRE的控制策略和参数化控制方法，用于精确模拟人类步态，为膝盖式外骨骼提供了一个可靠和可重复的测试机制。

Abstract: Exoskeletons are widely used in rehabilitation and industrial applications to
assist human motion. However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible
exoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a
safer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal
robot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton
evaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation
(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait
replication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum
model, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human
motion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized
control method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively
replicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping
trapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear
velocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This
modification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring
compatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes
the control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and
torques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in
accordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load
associated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility
of the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait. The
bipedal robot platform provides a reliable and repeatable testing mechanism for
knee-type exoskeletons, offering insights into exoskeleton performance under
controlled conditions.

\textit{simplified tire wear model}. In the experiment, the proposed method can
be solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and
by incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by
19.19\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments.
In the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees
from the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\%
compared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer

Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for
multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The
proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations,
which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve
scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint
matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP
formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without
losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex
combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and
thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed
in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500
robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision
avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization
techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in
generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in
complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance
introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the
solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The
algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including
warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks
or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes
both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and
task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous

Abstract: This research proposes a novel morphing structure with shells inspired by the
movement of pillbugs. Instead of the pillbug body, a loopcoupled mechanism
based on slider-crank mechanisms is utilized to achieve the rolling up and
spreading motion. This mechanism precisely imitates three distinct curves that
mimic the shape morphing of a pillbug. To decrease the degree-of-freedom (DOF)
of the mechanism to one, scissor mechanisms are added. 3D curved shells are
then attached to the tracer points of the morphing mechanism to safeguard it
from attacks while allowing it to roll. Through type and dimensional synthesis,
a complete system that includes shells and an underlying morphing mechanism is
developed. A 3D model is created and tested to demonstrate the proposed
system's shape-changing capability. Lastly, a robot with two modes is developed
based on the proposed mechanism, which can curl up to roll down hills and can
spread to move in a straight line via wheels.

Abstract: We present a framework for simulating fluid-robot multiphysics as a single,
unified optimization problem. The coupled manipulator and incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations governing the robot and fluid dynamics are derived
together from a single Lagrangian using the principal of least action. We then
employ discrete variational mechanics to derive a stable, implicit
time-integration scheme for jointly simulating both the fluid and robot
dynamics, which are tightly coupled by a constraint that enforces the no-slip
boundary condition at the fluid-robot interface. Extending the classical
immersed boundary method, we derive a new formulation of the no-slip constraint
that is numerically well-conditioned and physically accurate for multibody
systems commonly found in robotics. We demonstrate our approach's physical
accuracy on benchmark computational fluid-dynamics problems, including
Poiseuille flow and a disc in free stream. We then design a locomotion policy
for a novel swimming robot in simulation and validate results on real-world
hardware, showcasing our framework's sim-to-real capability for robotics tasks.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: Maintaining an active lifestyle is vital for quality of life, yet challenging
for wheelchair users. For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks
of obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair
users, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often
face upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges
underscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while
minimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use
enhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual
physiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we
introduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized
assistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain
their physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on
obstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological
data-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive
assistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep
Q-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users
within a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted
preliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and
slate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for
individual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity
zone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users,
we observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent,
delaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement. These
results indicate that PulseRide offers a healthier, adaptive mobility solution,
bridging the gap between passive and physically taxing mobility options.

Result: 加速后的策略执行速度最高可达3倍，同时保持任务完成性能。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the
policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy
demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present
DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution
via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training
an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed
demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key
insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more
consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for
higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates
correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely
accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the
estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase
with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting
policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion
performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success
rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits
of reduced decision-making horizons.

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人足球比赛中，通过合成数据训练的检测器与手动标注的真实图像训练的检测器性能相当。

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Conclusion: 提出了一种快速且计算高效的分层探索规划方法，在探索效率和轨迹速度方面优于其他方法。

Abstract: Efficient autonomous exploration in large-scale environments remains
challenging due to the high planning computational cost and low-speed
maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a fast and computationally efficient
dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer method is
efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily
exploring the target in the region of the first routing area with high speed.
Specifically, the proposed method finds the long-term area routing through an
approximate algorithm to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments.
Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the lowest
curvature-penalized cost, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by
sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further
speed up the exploration, we adopt an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented
trajectory to enhance exploration continuity. The proposed method is compared
to state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results
show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration
efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct
real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
The code will be open-sourced.

<details>

Motivation: 由于强化学习在真实世界中存在模拟与现实差距以及可解释性不足的问题，导致在严格安全要求的任务中，如行星探测、核设施检查和深海作业中，未约束的强化学习策略仍存在不可避免的安全问题，例如关节碰撞、过度扭矩或低摩擦环境中的脚打滑。

Method: 本文设计了一种基于分层优化的全身跟随者，该跟随者将硬约束和软约束集成到强化学习框架中，以使机器人具有更好的安全保障。利用基于模型控制的优势，该方法允许在训练或部署期间定义各种类型的硬约束和软约束，从而允许策略微调和减轻模拟与现实迁移的挑战。同时，它在处理复杂无结构环境中的运动时保留了强化学习的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive performance in legged
locomotion over various challenging environments. However, due to the
sim-to-real gap and lack of explainability, unconstrained RL policies deployed
in the real world still suffer from inevitable safety issues, such as joint
collisions, excessive torque, or foot slippage in low-friction environments.
These problems limit its usage in missions with strict safety requirements,
such as planetary exploration, nuclear facility inspection, and deep-sea
operations. In this paper, we design a hierarchical optimization-based
whole-body follower, which integrates both hard and soft constraints into RL
framework to make the robot move with better safety guarantees. Leveraging the
advantages of model-based control, our approach allows for the definition of
various types of hard and soft constraints during training or deployment, which
allows for policy fine-tuning and mitigates the challenges of sim-to-real
transfer. Meanwhile, it preserves the robustness of RL when dealing with
locomotion in complex unstructured environments. The trained policy with
introduced constraints was deployed in a hexapod robot and tested in various
outdoor environments, including snow-covered slopes and stairs, demonstrating
the great traversability and safety of our approach.

Abstract: Human motion retargeting for humanoid robots, transferring human motion data
to robots for imitation, presents significant challenges but offers
considerable potential for real-world applications. Traditionally, this process
relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion
capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to mapping
human motion to humanoids. To address the inherent discrepancies between the
generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid
robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation
loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a
reinforcement learning-based whole-body joint motion control policy. The policy
ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot's
stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real
humanoid robot NAO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种平滑分块动作序列的轻量级后优化框架，显著提高了运动质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数学习方法依赖于离散动作分块，这在块边界引入了不连续性，降低了运动质量，尤其是在抛掷或举起重物等动态任务中，平滑轨迹对动量传递和系统稳定性至关重要。

Method: 该方法结合了三个关键组件：1）推理感知的块调度以主动生成重叠块并避免推理延迟造成的暂停；2）在重叠区域进行线性混合以减少突然过渡；3）在有限扰动空间内进行最小化加加速度的轨迹优化。

Result: 在位置控制的机械臂上执行动态操作任务时，该方法得到了验证。实验结果表明，该方法显著降低了振动和运动抖动，实现了更平滑的执行和更高的机械鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了振动和运动抖动，实现了更平滑的执行和更高的机械鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning have enabled robots to perform
increasingly complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. However,
most learned policies rely on discrete action chunking, which introduces
discontinuities at chunk boundaries. These discontinuities degrade motion
quality and are particularly problematic in dynamic tasks such as throwing or
lifting heavy objects, where smooth trajectories are critical for momentum
transfer and system stability. In this work, we present a lightweight
post-optimization framework for smoothing chunked action sequences. Our method
combines three key components: (1) inference-aware chunk scheduling to
proactively generate overlapping chunks and avoid pauses from inference delays;
(2) linear blending in the overlap region to reduce abrupt transitions; and (3)
jerk-minimizing trajectory optimization constrained within a bounded
perturbation space. The proposed method was validated on a position-controlled
robotic arm performing dynamic manipulation tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces vibration and motion
jitter, leading to smoother execution and improved mechanical robustness.

Abstract: Multi-part assembly poses significant challenges for robots to execute
long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation with generalization across complex
geometries. We present Fabrica, a dual-arm robotic system capable of end-to-end
planning and control for autonomous assembly of general multi-part objects. For
planning over long horizons, we develop hierarchies of precedence, sequence,
grasp, and motion planning with automated fixture generation, enabling general
multi-step assembly on any dual-arm robots. The planner is made efficient
through a parallelizable design and is optimized for downstream control
stability. For contact-rich assembly steps, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that trains generalist policies across object
geometries, assembly directions, and grasp poses, guided by equivariance and
residual actions obtained from the plan. These policies transfer zero-shot to
the real world and achieve 80% successful steps. For systematic evaluation, we
propose a benchmark suite of multi-part assemblies resembling industrial and
daily objects across diverse categories and geometries. By integrating
efficient global planning and robust local control, we showcase the first
system to achieve complete and generalizable real-world multi-part assembly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减轻视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的风险，并展示其潜在的攻击能力。

Method: 通过在不同数据集上对VLMs进行细粒度分割，并使用危险图像的补丁进行对抗性数据中毒，展示了视觉拼接的能力。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs可以通过视觉拼接能力将分散的视觉信息整合在一起，生成有害的响应。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为视觉拼接的核心能力，用于攻击视觉-语言模型（VLMs），并通过实验证明其有效性。

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

TL;DR: DES是一种自适应调整对抗扰动预算的新框架，可提高对抗鲁棒性和标准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖于固定的扰动预算，无法考虑实例特定的鲁棒性特征。

Method: DES框架通过结合梯度近似、softmax熵和蒙特卡洛dropout来估计模型不确定性，并动态调整对抗扰动预算。

Result: DES在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上提高了对抗鲁棒性和标准精度。

Conclusion: DES通过结合三个关键因素，自适应地调整对抗扰动预算，从而提高对抗鲁棒性和标准精度。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Conclusion: 当前开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中仍落后于商业MLLM，当前多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual

reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge

comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best

*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldPrediction是一个视频基准，用于评估AI模型的世界建模和程序规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估AI模型在复杂环境中的世界建模和程序规划能力。

Method: 使用视觉观察来表示状态和动作，并通过“动作等价”来防止模型利用低级连续性线索。

Result: 在WorldPrediction-WM上，当前前沿模型的准确率仅为57%，而在WorldPrediction-PP上为38%。

Conclusion: WorldPrediction是一个视频基准，用于评估不同AI模型的世界建模和程序规划能力。

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

Motivation: 冰球直播视频中的冰球检测面临挑战，如冰球尺寸小、频繁遮挡、运动模糊、广播伪影和由于摄像机变焦和摄像机视角变化导致的尺度不一致。

Method: PLUCC由三个组件组成：上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器。上下文编码器利用球员的朝向和定位作为先验；特征金字塔编码器从双编码器中提取多尺度特征；门控解码器结合潜在特征和通道门控机制。

Conclusion: PLUCC在PuckDataset数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能，平均精度提高了12.2%，RSLE平均精度提高了25%。研究证明了上下文理解在提高冰球检测性能中的关键作用，具有广泛的自动化体育分析意义。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频Transformer模型在BdSL识别任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高听力障碍人群的沟通无障碍性。

Method: 在BdSLW60和BdSLW401数据集上微调了VideoMAE、ViViT和TimeSformer模型，并应用了数据增强技术。

Result: VideoMAE模型在BdSLW60数据集上达到了95.5%的准确率，在BdSLW401数据集上达到了81.04%的准确率。

Conclusion: 视频Transformer模型在BdSL识别任务中显著优于传统机器学习和深度学习方法。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

TL;DR: 激活最大化技术被成功应用于基于DNN的编码模型，以探索人类视觉系统的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索驱动大脑对视觉刺激反应的特定特征。

Method: 提取和自适应下采样预训练的Inception V3网络的多层激活，然后使用线性回归预测fMRI响应。

Result: 生成的图像能够在低级和高级视觉区域以及不同受试者中可靠地驱动目标区域的活性。

Conclusion: 激活最大化技术可以成功应用于基于DNN的编码模型，从而灵活地描述和调节人类视觉系统中的响应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val是一种新的智能数据生成框架，通过利用LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量的合成数据，有效提高了计算机视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉任务中的数据稀缺和标签噪声问题，提高合成数据生成方法的有效性。

Method: Gen-n-Val由两个智能体组成：LD提示智能体和数据分析智能体。LD提示智能体使用LLM优化提示以生成高质量的背景实例图像和分割掩码。数据分析智能体使用VLLM过滤掉低质量的合成实例图像。

Result: Gen-n-Val在COCO实例分割中，与YOLOv9c和YOLO11m结合使用时，将无效合成数据从50%降低到7%，并提高了1%的mAP。在YOLO11m的开放词汇物体检测基准测试中，Gen-n-Val比YOLO-Worldv2-M提高了7.1%的mAP。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val通过利用层扩散（LD）、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量的单物体掩码和多样化的背景，有效解决了计算机视觉任务中的数据稀缺和标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于扰动的方法可能不足以提供对基于扩散编辑的鲁棒图像保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用先进扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）进行图像编辑可能带来的风险。

Method: 在多个领域和编辑任务中使用基于扰动的图像保护方法进行实验。

Result: 大多数情况下，基于扩散的编辑会产生与引导提示精确匹配的输出图像。

Conclusion: 基于扰动的方法可能不足以提供对基于扩散编辑的鲁棒图像保护。

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络中的卷积滤波器缺乏标准化，导致图像在经过大气传递时响应失真，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出过滤器归一化方法，类似于批量归一化，使滤波器具有大气等变特性，提高模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Result: 在人工和自然强度变化基准测试中，该方法显著提高了模型的性能，ResNet34甚至可以大幅超越CLIP。

Conclusion: 过滤器归一化可以改善深度学习模型的性能和鲁棒性，提高模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

TL;DR: HMAR是一种新的图像生成算法，通过下一尺度预测和掩码预测生成高质量的图像，提高了采样速度，并在基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAR在生成高质量图像时存在的速度和质量之间的差距问题，以及序列长度随图像分辨率超线性增长、需要重新训练以更改采样计划等问题。

Method: HMAR将下一尺度预测重新定义为马尔可夫过程，其中每个分辨率尺度的预测仅依赖于其直接前驱的标记，而不是所有前驱分辨率中的标记。在预测分辨率尺度时，HMAR使用可控制的多步掩码生成过程来生成每步的标记子集。

Conclusion: HMAR通过下一尺度预测和掩码预测来生成高质量的图像，同时提高了采样速度。在ImageNet 256x256和512x512基准测试中，HMAR模型在参数匹配的情况下与VAR、扩散模型和自回归基线相当或优于它们。HMAR具有更高的灵活性，其采样计划可以更改而无需进一步训练，并且可以以零样本方式应用于图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 解决使用以帧率为6DoF姿态估计的现有方法中忽略的像素级重建的必要细节。

Method: 使用VIBA校准时间戳和运动，结合物理图像形成模型到高斯喷射中。

Result: PSNR提高了+2 dB。

Conclusion: 提出两种重要发现，一是强调使用视觉惯性光束调整（VIBA）来校准滚动快门RGB传感器的精确时间戳和运动，二是将物理图像形成模型结合到高斯喷射中，以解决传感器特性，包括RGB相机的滚动快门效应和传感器的动态范围。通过VIBA和图像形成模型的结合，PSNR提高了+2 dB。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

Method: 提出了一种面部去正脸化方法，通过训练一个自适应的面部去正脸化FFWM模型，并在大规模数据集上训练一个ResNet-50面部特征提取模型。

Result: 面部去正脸化方法在四个公开数据集上提高了识别准确率，且在某些数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在资源受限的边缘设备上运行困难，因为它们具有不规则的记忆访问模式和高的计算成本。

Method: FALO首先将稀疏3D体素按其坐标和邻近性排列成1D序列，然后通过ConvDotMix块处理，该块由大核卷积、Hadamard积和线性层组成。

Result: FALO在nuScenes和Waymo等LiDAR 3D检测基准上取得了具有竞争力的性能，并且比最新的SOTA快1.6~9.8倍。

Conclusion: FALO在LiDAR 3D检测中实现了最先进的检测精度和快速的推理速度。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

Conclusion: 结合语言引导和视觉编码器的深度伪造检测方法能够显著提高检测准确性和鲁棒性，为未来深度伪造检测提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能终端设备在裂缝检测中的实时监控性能问题。

Method: EECD-Net采用多阶段检测方法，包括SRCNN、SCU和GAT模块。

Result: EECD-Net在CrackVision12K基准测试中达到98.6%的检测准确率，能耗仅为5.6 mJ。

Conclusion: EECD-Net通过提高准确性和能源效率，为基于仪器的裂缝检测提供了可扩展、低功耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少SISR模型的参数和计算需求，并提高图像质量。

Method: 提出了一种名为Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs)的模块，用于直接增强图像频率成分。

Result: LSKs能够有效地增强图像频率成分，提高模型性能。

Conclusion: LSKs可显著减少SISR模型的参数和计算需求，并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

Motivation: 将复杂推理任务的能力扩展到多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）面临着由于升级底层推理LLMs时的视觉语言对齐成本高昂的挑战。

Method: RACRO是一种推理引导的强化学习策略，通过基于奖励的优化将提取器的字幕行为与推理目标对齐。

Result: RACRO方法在多模态数学和科学基准测试中实现了最先进的平均性能，同时实现了高级推理LLMs的卓越可扩展性和即插即用适应性。

Conclusion: RACRO方法显著提高了视觉基础和提取推理优化表示的能力，在多模态数学和科学基准测试中实现了最先进的平均性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Conclusion: 提出了一种轻量级的全局建模网络（LGM-Pose）来解决现有方法的挑战，实验结果表明该方法参数更少，性能更优，速度更快。

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Motivation: 为了解决从单目视频输入中生成和编辑4D内容的问题。

Method: 通过利用强大的视频修复基础模型作为生成先验，将4D视频创作重新定义为视频修复任务，使模型能够填补由相机轨迹变化或用户编辑造成的缺失内容。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种名为Follow-Your-Creation的4D视频创作框架，能够从单目视频输入中生成和编辑4D内容。

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为HEC的分层具身持续学习方法，通过聚类视觉文本嵌入实现任务识别，并使用SVD技术减少遗忘，有效支持持续学习新任务的同时保留先验知识。

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Method: 利用大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）的常识推理能力，结合现成的参数化人类生成器，实现高质量的个性化头像生成。关键创新是自主验证循环，通过渲染草案头像，评估面部相似度、解剖学合理性和提示一致性，迭代调整生成参数以达到收敛。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: 我们的框架为传感器深度增强设定了新的基准，具有在自动驾驶、机器人和沉浸式技术中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Conclusion: FPSAttention通过联合优化FP8量化和稀疏性，显著提高了视频生成的速度和效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: MARS是一种结合CNN和Transformers的多尺度感知无线电地图超分辨率方法，提高了重建准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从稀疏测量中重建准确的无线电地图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: MARS结合CNN和Transformers，采用多尺度特征融合和残差连接。

Result: MARS在MSE和SSIM方面优于基线模型，同时保持低计算成本。

Conclusion: MARS具有强的实用潜力。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

TL;DR: MoViX是一种鲁棒的跨视图视频定位框架，在GPS受限的非公路环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GPS受限的非公路环境中，跨视图3-DoF定位面临植被重复、地形无结构以及季节变化等问题。

Method: MoViX采用自监督跨视图视频定位框架，学习视点和季节不变的表示，并使用姿态依赖的正样本采样策略和运动信息帧采样器等。

Result: MoViX在TartanDrive 2.0数据集上训练不到30分钟，测试超过12.29公里，定位精度高。

Conclusion: MoViX在GPS受限的非公路环境中实现了鲁棒的跨视图3-DoF定位，在未知的区域定位精度高，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

Conclusion: SafeLLaVA在HoliSafe上训练，在多个VLM基准测试中实现了最先进的安全性能。HoliSafe基准本身也揭示了现有模型的关键漏洞。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Result: 在六个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并实现了数据集的联合训练。

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow在点云配准和多部件形状组装方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Conclusion: 多模态模型中的图像表示在隐藏激活中具有多样性，且随着层数的加深，不同模态之间的共享度增加。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Motivation: 为了提高少样本适应中的OOD泛化能力，我们研究了鲁棒的少样本VLM适应方法。

Method: 我们比较了不同的适应方法（如提示调整、线性探测、对比微调和全微调），并提出了SRAPF方法，包括部分微调视觉编码器和对抗部分微调。

Result: SRAPF在ImageNet OOD基准测试上实现了最先进的ID和OOD准确率。

Conclusion: 我们提出了SRAPF，这是一种基于检索增强的对抗部分微调方法，它在ImageNet OOD基准测试上实现了最先进的ID和OOD准确率。

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

Motivation: AIGV视频存在视觉质量缺陷，影响用户体验，因此需要有效的自动视觉质量评估方法。

Method: 将AIGV视频质量分解为三个维度：技术质量、运动质量和视频语义，设计对应编码器，引入LLM作为质量回归模块，并使用多模态提示工程和LoRA微调技术。

Result: 在NTIRE 2025挑战赛中取得第二名，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在AIGV视频质量评估方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

Result: 实验结果表明，iDPOE在轨迹预测方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iDPOE方法在轨迹预测方面超越了最先进的方法，这是首次将模仿学习应用于手术技能发展的分割轨迹预测。

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: LAT通过将不同源数据集的注释投影到目标数据集的标签空间，实现了跨异构数据集的标签空间迁移，从而在多个基准测试中显著提高了目标域检测性能。

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

Motivation: VLMs易受后门攻击，攻击者可以注入难以察觉的扰动，导致模型生成恶意、攻击者控制的字幕。

Method: SRD使用深度Q网络学习策略，对敏感图像区域应用离散扰动（例如遮挡、颜色掩码），以破坏恶意路径的激活。

Result: SRD将攻击成功率降低到5.6%，同时在干净输入上保持字幕质量，性能下降不到10%。

Conclusion: SRD提供了一种针对多模态生成模型中隐蔽后门威胁的无触发器、可解释的防御范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting

ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third

PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: RAP方法使用仅9.3%的训练数据，在六个数据集上实现了优越的性能，同时降低了43%的计算成本。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at

Motivation: 为了解决无监督单目深度学习通常依赖于时间相邻图像之间的光度关系的问题，以及之前工作忽略SSIM函数中不同组件及其相应超参数对训练的影响的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的SSIM形式，使用加法而不是乘法来组合SSIM中的亮度、对比度和结构相似度相关组件。

Result: 与原始SSIM函数相比，新形式的SSIM在无监督深度估计上实现了更高的性能。在KITTI-2015户外数据集上，优化后的SSIM损失函数可以显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出的新SSIM形式在无监督单目深度估计中表现出色，优化后的损失函数在KITTI-2015数据集上优于基线。

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

Conclusion: HypeVPR在超空间中引入了一种新的分层嵌入框架，以解决P2E VPR的独特挑战。该方法在多种基准数据集上实现了比现有方法更快的检索速度，检索速度最高可达5倍。

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X是一个用于多模态3D场景表示的通用框架，能够提供高质量的重建和高效的存储。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于特定于任务的嵌入，导致嵌入无法解码为显式几何形状并跨任务重用。

Method: Object-X通过在3D体素网格中几何地定位捕获的模态，并学习融合体素信息和物体属性的无结构嵌入。

Result: Object-X在两个具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上产生了高保真度的新视图合成，同时显著提高了几何精度。

Conclusion: Object-X是一个通用的多模态物体表示框架，能够编码丰富的物体嵌入并解码为详细的几何和视觉重建。它在多个任务中表现出色，如场景对齐、单图像3D物体重建和定位。

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

TL;DR: 我们提出了LotusFilter，一个用于多样化ANNS结果的快速后处理模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在搜索结果中实现相似性和多样性。

Method: 我们使用预计算的截止表来过滤冗余向量，从而多样化ANNS结果。

Result: LotusFilter在类似真实世界RAG应用的环境中运行速度快（0.02 [ms/query]）。

Conclusion: 我们提出了LotusFilter，一个用于多样化ANNS结果的后处理模块。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Motivation: 提高RANSAC在不同问题上的性能，特别是在结构从运动和同时定位与建图等计算机视觉任务中。

Method: SupeRANSAC是一种新的统一RANSAC流程，包括对RANSAC有效性的详细分析，包括单应性、基本/本质矩阵和绝对/刚体姿态估计。

Result: SupeRANSAC在多个问题和数据集上显著提高了性能，平均提高了6个AUC点。

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC是一种新的统一RANSAC流程，在多个问题和数据集上显著提高了性能，平均提高了6个AUC点。

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 有效地将事件流转换为与标准计算机视觉管道兼容的格式是一个挑战，特别是在噪声存在的情况下。

Method: Spike-TBR结合了基于帧的TBR优势和脉冲神经网络的噪声过滤能力，形成更鲁棒的事件流表示。

Result: Spike-TBR在多个数据集上评估了四种变体，在噪声环境下表现出色，同时改善了干净数据的结果。

Conclusion: Spike-TBR是一种基于TBR的事件编码策略，通过整合脉冲神经元提高了事件流的鲁棒性，并在噪声环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of

few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic

Motivation: 由于直接将基于Transformer的模型应用于真实世界视频超分辨率（VSR）具有挑战性，因此提出了DualX-VSR以克服这些问题。

Method: DualX-VSR采用了一种新的双轴空间×时间注意力机制，消除了运动补偿的需求，提供了对时空信息的连贯表示。

Result: DualX-VSR在真实世界视频超分辨率任务中实现了高保真度和优越性能。

Conclusion: DualX-VSR通过引入新的双轴空间×时间注意力机制，在真实世界视频超分辨率任务中实现了高保真度和优越性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Result: 在ScanNet数据集上验证了OpenMaskDINO3D在多个任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D为3D理解和分割提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Result: 该模型在6层搜索下达到2593的Elo评级，且随着模型规模和嵌入维度增加而性能提升。

Conclusion: 潜在空间规划可能成为传统搜索的可行替代方案，该方法可推广到其他可学习状态评估的完美信息游戏。

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

Conclusion: 现有模型在理解3D场景方面存在关键差距。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频的胚胎评分方法，通过全长度时间推移监测视频预测胚胎质量，为AI辅助胚胎选择提供了新的方法框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的胚胎选择方法要么只考虑部分胚胎评估，缺乏整体质量评估，要么目标受额外胚胎因素的影响，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出了一个名为CoSTeM的框架，该框架包含两个分支：形态分支和形态动力学分支。形态分支使用混合交叉注意力专家层和时序选择块来选择判别性局部结构特征，形态动力学分支使用时序转换器来建模全局发育轨迹。

Result: CoSTeM框架在实验中表现出优越性，为AI辅助胚胎选择提供了有价值的方法框架。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为基于视频的胚胎评分的新任务，通过全长度时间推移监测（TLM）视频来预测胚胎学家对胚胎的整体质量评估。CoSTeM框架通过结合静态和动态因素来评估胚胎，为AI辅助胚胎选择提供了有价值的方法框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于架构先验的鲁棒图像质量评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像质量评估模型在现实系统中的应用越来越广泛，但其固有不稳定性和易受攻击性带来了风险。

Method: 提出将鲁棒性作为架构先验，通过正交信息流、约束网络操作和剪枝微调等方法重塑模型内部结构，提高其鲁棒性。

Result: 设计了一种鲁棒的图像质量评估架构，能够抵御对抗攻击，无需对抗训练或对原始模型进行重大修改。

Conclusion: 从优化鲁棒性通过数据到通过设计实现鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APVR框架，通过分层视觉信息检索提高视频理解性能，在无训练和基于训练的方法中均取得最先进成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频多模态大型语言模型在处理小时级视频理解时面临计算限制和从大量时间序列中提取信息效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出APVR（自适应枢轴视觉信息检索）框架，通过分层视觉信息检索解决内存墙限制。APVR通过两个互补组件运行：枢轴帧检索采用语义扩展和多模态置信度评分来识别语义相关的视频帧，而枢轴令牌检索在枢轴帧内执行查询感知的注意力驱动令牌选择。这种双重粒度方法使处理一小时的视频成为可能，同时保持语义一致性。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME上的实验验证表明，该方法在无训练和基于训练的方法中都取得了显著的性能提升，并建立了最先进的成果，同时提供了与现有MLLM架构的即插即用集成能力。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT是一种高效的Transformer，用于高质量动态医学视频的合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在处理动态医学视频时存在不足，如通道交互不足、计算复杂度高和噪声水平变化时的去噪指导粗糙。

Method: FEAT是一种全维高效的注意力Transformer，具有序列时空通道注意力机制、线性复杂度设计和残差值引导模块。

Result: FEAT-S在参数数量仅为最先进模型Endora的23%的情况下，实现了可比较甚至更优的性能。FEAT-L在多个数据集上优于所有比较方法。

Conclusion: FEAT通过三个关键创新解决了现有Transformer方法的限制，实现了高质量动态医学视频的合成，并在多个数据集上优于比较方法。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

TL;DR: BalSAM模型在树冠实例分割方面具有潜力，但需要进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低森林生态系统监测和森林管理规划的成本、时间和劳动力，同时提高监测精度。

Method: 比较了利用SAM进行自动树冠实例分割的方法，并研究了将高程数据（DSM信息）集成到模型中的方法。

Result: BalSAM模型在人工林环境中表现出色，但使用SAM的方法可能不如定制化的Mask R-CNN。

Conclusion: BalSAM模型在树冠实例分割方面具有潜力，尤其是在人工林环境中。使用SAM的方法可能不如定制化的Mask R-CNN，但通过端到端微调和集成DSM信息是很有前景的途径。

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Motivation: 解决现有长视频文本问答数据集的限制，如视频时长和评估范围狭窄。

Method: TextVidBench包含跨领域长视频覆盖、三阶段评估框架和高质量细粒度注释。提出了通过IT-Rope机制、时间提示工程、非均匀位置编码和轻量级微调改进大型模型的方法。

Conclusion: TextVidBench提出了针对长视频文本问答的基准，挑战现有模型，并提供了改进长视频场景文本理解能力的方法。

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于VAR的图像超分辨率方法，通过层次图像标记化和直接偏好优化实现了高效且高质量的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有图像超分辨率方法的局限性，如VARSR在固定分辨率下工作且需要大量参数和外部数据，本文旨在提出一种更高效、更轻量级的图像超分辨率方法。

Method: 本文使用视觉自回归（VAR）模型和层次图像标记化方法，结合直接偏好优化（DPO）正则化项，实现了图像超分辨率。

Result: 本文提出的模型在图像超分辨率任务上取得了最先进的成果，同时使用了较小的模型规模和无需外部训练数据。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的图像超分辨率方法，通过两个创新组件实现了半倍和全倍放大率的高质量图像重建，同时保持了较小的模型规模和无需外部训练数据。

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在多视角中进行技能评估，需要捕获区分专家和新手表现的基本运动模式，而当前的视频采样方法破坏了熟练度评估所需的时序连续性。

Method: PATS通过自适应地分割视频，确保每个分析的片段包含关键性能组件的完整执行，并在多个片段中重复此过程，以最大程度地覆盖信息同时保持时序一致性。

Result: PATS在EgoExo4D基准测试中超越了最先进的准确性，并在挑战性领域取得了显著进步。

Conclusion: PATS成功适应了不同的活动特征，证明了它作为自适应时间采样方法的有效性，推进了自动化技能评估在实际应用中的应用。

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理复杂和多样化的文本布局方面的局限性。

Method: CSTR-CLIP 集成了全局视觉信息和多粒度对齐训练，采用两阶段训练过程。

Result: CSTR-CLIP 在 DL-CSVTR 数据集上优于之前的最佳模型，提高了准确率并加快了推理速度。

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP 在处理各种文本布局方面优于之前的最佳模型，提高了 18.82% 的准确率，并提供了更快的推理速度。

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Motivation: 单目深度估计旨在从单目摄像头捕获的RGB图像中确定每个像素的深度。

Method: 该方法利用深度学习，特别是多尺度融合网络和分类方法，以及引入额外先验和更有效的目标函数来提高单目深度估计的准确性。

Result: 尽管取得了一定的进展，但将模型推广到未见过的领域仍然是一个挑战。最近，Depth Anything在零样本单目深度估计方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单目深度估计方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在一些挑战，例如在未见过的领域中推广模型。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

Conclusion: FlowDirector 提出了一种新的非逆变换视频编辑框架，在指令遵循、时间一致性和背景保持方面取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.

and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于越南文字的复杂音标、声调变化以及缺乏大规模标注数据集，越南文本识别面临独特挑战。

Method: 本文综述了现有的越南文档识别技术，突出了关键局限性，并探讨了大型语言模型如何革新该领域。

Result: 通过解决这些差距，旨在促进越南文档分析识别的进步，并鼓励社区驱动的解决方案。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 和 Seedream 3.0 模型在图像编辑方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态街道评估框架，用于评估街道景观，并在哈尔滨进行了验证。


<details>

Motivation: 客观街道指标在都市分析中已成为标准，但不足以捕捉包容性都市设计所必需的主观感知。

Method: 提出了一种新的多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），融合视觉Transformer和大型语言模型，对街道景观进行可解释的双输出评估。使用LoRA和P-Tuning v2对框架进行微调，以实现参数高效的适应。

Result: 在哈尔滨的15,000多张标注街道图像上进行了微调，并在客观特征上实现了0.84的F1分数，与居民感知的总体一致性为89.3%。MSEF不仅捕获了上下文相关的矛盾，还识别了非线性和非语义依赖的模式，揭示了通用空间启发式方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），能够融合视觉Transformer和大型语言模型，对街道景观进行可解释的双输出评估。该框架在哈尔滨的15,000多张标注街道图像上进行了微调，并在客观特征上实现了0.84的F1分数，与居民感知的总体一致性为89.3%。MSEF不仅捕获了上下文相关的矛盾，还识别了非线性和非语义依赖的模式，揭示了通用空间启发式方法的局限性。通过生成基于注意力机制的基于自然语言的推理，该框架将感官数据与情感推断相结合，实现了与SDG 11一致的透明诊断。这项工作在都市感知建模方面提供了方法论创新，并为寻求协调基础设施精度与生活体验的规划系统提供了实际效用。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA是一种自动框架，用于优化vDiT视频生成，显著提高推理速度并保持视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散变压器（vDiT）在文本到视频生成方面取得了显著进展，但其计算需求高，限制了实际部署。ASTRAEA旨在解决这一问题，提高vDiT视频生成的效率。

Method: ASTRAEA提出了一种自动框架，搜索vDiT视频生成的近似最优配置，包括轻量级标记选择机制和内存高效的GPU并行稀疏注意力策略，以及利用经典进化算法的搜索框架。

Result: ASTRAEA在单个GPU上实现了高达2.4倍的推理速度提升，在8个GPU上可达13.2倍，同时视频质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASTRAEA通过轻量级标记选择机制和高效的GPU并行稀疏注意力策略，实现了对vDiT视频生成的优化，大幅提高了推理速度并保持了较高的视频质量。

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们引入了无参考的多样性测量方法，发现模型在扩展时牺牲了多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动评估方法要么需要参考图像数据集，要么缺乏关于测量的多样性的具体信息，这限制了它们的适应性和可解释性。

Method: 我们引入了Does-it/Can-it框架，DIM-CIM，这是一个无参考的默认模式多样性（“模型是否生成具有预期属性的图像”）和泛化能力（“模型是否为特定概念生成多样化的属性”）的测量方法。

Result: 我们发现，当从1.5B到8.1B参数扩展时，广泛使用的模型在泛化能力上有所提高，但以默认模式多样性为代价。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一个灵活且可解释的框架来评估T2I模型多样性和泛化能力，从而更全面地理解模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

TL;DR: 我们开发了一种实用的操纵模型（PMM），该模型通过扩展伪假空间和增强训练图像的退化来提高深度伪造检测模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测模型在非理想条件下表现不稳定，限制了在某些基准数据集上的成功，并容易被绕过。

Method: 我们通过使用泊松混合、更多样化的遮罩、生成器伪影和干扰物来扩展伪假空间，并通过在训练图像中添加强退化来提高检测器的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Result: 我们的方法显著提高了模型对常见图像退化的鲁棒性，并在标准基准数据集上提高了性能。在DFDC和DFDCP数据集上，相对于s-o-t-a LAA主干，AUC分别提高了3.51%和6.21%。

Conclusion: 我们开发了一种实用的操纵模型（PMM），该模型可以有效地提高深度伪造检测模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Motivation: 研究VLMs对场景结构和语义的理解能力。

Method: 引入CIVET，一个新颖且可扩展的框架，用于通过可控刺激进行系统评估。

Result: 通过CIVET评估了五种最先进的VLMs，发现它们在识别对象属性、理解场景结构和语义方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs只能准确识别有限的基本对象属性；它们的性能严重依赖于对象在场景中的位置；它们难以理解对象间的基本关系。与人类标注者相比，VLMs在实现人类水平精度方面仍有不足。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Conclusion: FRED是一个针对无人机检测、跟踪和轨迹预测的多模态数据集，旨在推进高速无人机感知和多模态时空理解研究。

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Method: 生成TWR的范围-时间图和多普勒-时间图，然后使用角点检测方法确定人类目标前景和噪声背景的初始区域，使用多相主动轮廓模型分割微多普勒特征，将微多普勒分割特征离散化为二维点云，最后使用Mapper算法计算结果点云与模板数据点云之间的拓扑相似度以获得识别结果。

Result: 该方法通过数值模拟和测量实验证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于模板匹配的TWR HAR方法，不使用神经网络，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Motivation: 现有的方法主要关注检测视频中的异常对象，但往往忽略了更细粒度的分析，如异常像素，这限制了它们捕捉更广泛异常的能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架TAO，该框架将多个细粒度异常对象的检测集成到一个统一的框架中。通过将异常分数与下游任务（如分割和跟踪）相关联，无需调整阈值即可实现更精确的异常定位。

Result: 实验表明，TAO在准确性和鲁棒性方面达到了新的基准。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

Conclusion: TAPFM在膀胱癌和肺癌突变预测任务中优于传统方法，有效处理可操作突变的多标签分类，使强大的预训练PFMs在各种临床应用中适应性强。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

TL;DR: MokA是一种多模态感知的高效微调策略，可有效地适应MLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态微调方法存在关键局限性，即直接借鉴LLM，忽略了多模态场景的内在差异，甚至影响了所有模态的充分利用。

Method: MokA是一种多模态感知的高效微调策略，通过模态特定参数压缩单模态信息，同时显式增强跨模态交互。

Result: MokA在三个代表性多模态场景（音频-视觉-文本、视觉-文本和语音-文本）和多个LLM主干网络（LLaMA2/3、Qwen2、Qwen2.5-VL等）上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明该方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: MokA提供了一种更精准的MLLM高效适应方案，为MLLM的进一步探索铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Conclusion: 该系统在复杂和动态环境中具有实现鲁棒和自适应毫米波连接的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

Result: 事实记忆在跨模态之间转移，但在源模态和目标模态之间存在着显著的差距，这一差距在各种场景中都存在。

Conclusion: 我们研究了跨模态记忆的独特特性，发现学习到一个模态的事实可以转移到另一个模态，但在源模态和目标模态之间存在着显著的差距。我们提出了一个基准方法来减轻这一挑战，并希望我们的研究能够启发未来研究开发更鲁棒的多模态学习技术以增强跨模态可迁移性。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

Motivation: 发现检测模型在没有任何指令特定训练的情况下，比显式训练有语言指令的定位模型表现更好，因此提出DEGround。

Method: DEGround使用DETR查询作为检测和定位的对象表示，并引入了区域激活定位模块和查询级调制模块，以提高对语言指令的上下文理解。

Result: DEGround在EmbodiedScan验证集上整体准确率比BIP3D高7.52%。

Conclusion: DEGround在EmbodiedScan验证集上整体准确率比BIP3D高7.52%，表明即使是在类别级别的具身3D定位也可能不够好，更不用说更精细的上下文感知定位了。

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

Method: OGGSplat是一种开放高斯增长方法，通过RGB-语义一致性的修复模块和双向控制的图像扩散模型与语义扩散模型，实现了从稀疏视图到3D场景的重建。

Result: OGGSplat在语义感知场景重建方面取得了显著的成果，并建立了Gaussian Outpainting (GO)基准来评估重建质量。

Conclusion: OGGSplat通过利用开放高斯的光学属性提供强大的先验信息，实现了语义一致性和视觉合理性，在语义感知场景重建方面展现出良好的能力。

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Method: 提出了一种名为“Follow-Your-Motion”的高效两阶段视频运动传输框架，该框架通过微调强大的视频扩散转换器来合成复杂的运动。具体来说，提出了一种时空解耦LoRA来解耦空间外观和时间运动处理中的注意力架构。在第二个训练阶段，设计了稀疏运动采样和自适应RoPE来加速调整速度。

Result: 在MotionBench上进行了广泛的评估，验证了Follow-Your-Motion的优越性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Conclusion: DSG-World通过构建双状态观察的3D高斯世界模型，实现了高效的现实到模拟的转换，支持高保真渲染和场景操作，有效提高了现实世界3D重建和模拟的泛化能力。

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高文档解析的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用SRR三元组范式，将文档解析分解为结构分析、内容识别和逻辑排序三个基本问题。

Result: MonkeyOCR在性能和速度上优于MinerU、Qwen2.5-VL和Gemini 2.5 Pro等模型，在处理多页文档时速度更快。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR在文档解析任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at

Motivation: 医学图像分割的挑战在于SAM在医学领域的适应性有限。

Method: SAM-TTA框架包括SBCT和DUMT，用于解决输入和语义层面的差异。

Result: SAM-TTA在五个公共数据集上优于现有方法，在某些场景下甚至超过MedSAM。

Conclusion: 提出了SAM-TTA，它保留了SAM的泛化能力，同时在医学影像分割中提高了性能。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

Motivation: 视频内容冗余复杂性的影响加剧了偏好对齐技术中观察到的似然位移现象。

Method: 提出了一种名为LeanPO的方法，该方法通过将隐式奖励重新定义为与策略模型相关的响应平均似然度来减轻现象的影响。

Result: LeanPO显著提高了最先进的Video-LLMs的性能，同时最小化了额外的训练开销。

Conclusion: LeanPO显著提高了最先进的Video-LLMs的性能，同时最小化了额外的训练开销。LeanPO为将Video-LLM偏好与人类可信度对齐提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

Motivation: 大多数PAD系统由于隐私保护问题，只在一、两个或三个身份证件上训练。这导致它们在测试未知的新身份证件国家时无法获得具有竞争力的结果。

Method: 我们使用了不同的测试协议，包括零样本和微调，以及两个不同的身份证数据集。一个基于智利身份证的私有数据集和一个基于芬兰、西班牙和斯洛伐克三个国家的开放集。

Result: 我们的研究结果提高了基于大量数据集训练的Foundation Models的泛化能力，并证明了如何使用这些模型来适应身份证件的PAD泛化。

Conclusion: 我们的研究发现，真实图像是泛化的关键。

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

Result: 在TF-CoVR上，TF-CoVR-Base将零样本mAP@50从5.92提高到7.51，并在微调后从19.83提高到25.82。

Conclusion: TF-CoVR是第一个专注于时间细粒度CoVR的大规模基准，通过改进的模型和训练框架，在TF-CoVR上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

Conclusion: 通过几何基础的长期空间记忆，提高了视频世界模型的长期一致性，从而实现了长期一致的世界生成。

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

Conclusion: RaySt3R通过将3D形状补全重新定义为新颖的视图合成问题，实现了卓越的性能，在3D chamfer距离上比基线方法高出最多44%。

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体感基准主要关注静态场景探索，强调物体的外观和空间属性，而忽略了用户交互引起的动态变化评估。为了解决这一差距，我们引入了EOC-Bench，一个用于系统评估动态体心认知的创新基准。

Method: 我们开发了一个混合格式的人类在回路标注框架，包括四种类型的问题，并设计了一个新的多尺度时间准确性指标，用于开放式时间评估。

Result: EOC-Bench包含了3,277个精心标注的QA对，分为三个时间类别：过去、现在和未来，涵盖了11个细粒度评估维度和3种视觉物体引用类型。

Conclusion: EOC-Bench为提高MLLMs的体感认知能力提供了关键工具，为开发可靠的核心模型奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

TL;DR: AliTok是一种新的图像标记器，它通过建立单向依赖关系和两阶段训练实现了出色的重建性能，并在基准测试中超越了现有的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标记器在压缩过程中使用双向依赖关系对标记进行编码，这阻碍了自回归模型的有效建模。

Method: 提出了一种新的对齐标记器（AliTok），该标记器利用因果解码器在编码标记之间建立单向依赖关系，从而在标记器与自回归模型之间对齐标记建模方法。此外，通过引入前缀标记并采用两阶段标记器训练以提高重建一致性，AliTok在保持生成友好性的同时实现了出色的重建性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-256基准测试中，使用仅具有177M参数的标准解码器仅自回归模型作为生成器，AliTok实现了1.50的gFID分数和305.9的IS。当参数数量增加到662M时，AliTok实现了1.35的gFID分数，超过了具有10倍更快采样速度的最先进扩散方法。

Conclusion: AliTok在保持生成友好性的同时实现了出色的重建性能，并超越了现有的扩散方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有VR方法计算成本高的问题，以及将现有方法扩展到高分辨率VR的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种单步扩散视频恢复模型SeedVR2，对真实数据进行对抗性VR训练，并引入了自适应窗口注意力机制和一系列损失函数来提高训练效率和性能。

Result: SeedVR2在单个步骤中实现了与现有VR方法相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: SeedVR2可以在单个步骤中实现与现有VR方法相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

Conclusion: PAM是一个高效的综合区域级视觉理解框架，通过集成LLMs扩展了SAM 2，实现了同时进行对象分割和生成多样化的区域特定语义输出。PAM在区域理解任务中表现出色，同时具有轻量级和高效的特点。

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，找到图像和对象实例之间语义相似点的对应关系是永恒的挑战。

Method: 我们提出通过3D感知伪标签改进语义对应估计。具体来说，我们训练一个适配器，通过3D感知链获取伪标签来细化现成特征，通过放松循环一致性过滤错误标签，以及3D球形原型映射约束。

Result: 与先前工作相比，我们在SPair-71k上实现了超过4%的绝对增益，与具有类似监督要求的方法相比，增益超过7%。我们的方法具有通用性，简化了将训练扩展到其他数据源的过程。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为MARBLE的方法，用于通过在CLIP空间中找到材料嵌入来执行材料混合和重新组合，并使用浅层网络预测所需材料属性变化的方向。

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework for neural rendering, improving 4D scene understanding by addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenge of estimating physics from visual data in neural rendering. Existing methods require dense multi-view videos and have significant error accumulation. The proposed ProJo4D aims to address these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually increases the set of jointly optimized parameters. It optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material property simultaneously.

Result: ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决3D场景中心VLMs性能低下的问题，并促进对3D场景的真正理解。

Method: 提出一个新的3D相关性区分问答数据集，以破坏捷径学习和提高3D理解。

Result: 研究表明，3D场景中心VLMs对3D场景编码器的依赖有限，预训练阶段的效果不如2D VLMs，并且在大数据集上数据扩展的益处不太明显。

Conclusion: 3D场景中心VLMs在性能上落后于最新的3D对象中心和2D图像基础方法。研究发现这些模型过度依赖语言提示和频繁答案分布，从而降低了3D编码器的有效利用。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

Result: 我们的方法显著提高了前馈3DGS的渲染质量。

Conclusion: 我们的方法通过改进深度图，在多种架构和场景中显著提高了前馈3DGS，并提供了更一致的渲染结果。

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting是一个新的计数基准，AV-Reasoner模型通过强化学习实现了最佳性能。在语言空间中的推理在跨领域基准测试中未能带来性能提升。

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with

supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive

improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related

Conclusion: MINT-CoT通过自适应地将相关视觉标记插入文本推理步骤，有效地解决了数学领域的视觉混合推理问题。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress

well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to

Method: 该方法首先对网格进行分割和去家具处理，然后从SDM渲染的深度和法线图像中提取Canny边缘，并使用ControlNet inpainting技术去除全景图像中的家具。

Result: 该方法比依赖于神经辐射场或RGB-D inpainting的方法产生了更高的质量资产。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种生成室内空间去家具复制品的流程，该方法通过简化去家具网格（SDM）和全景图像的生成，实现了高质量的复制品。

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

TL;DR: DirectLayout通过使用大型语言模型的空间推理直接从文本描述生成3D布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景合成对于具身AI和数字内容创作至关重要。由于数据集有限，布局生成仍然具有挑战性。

Method: DirectLayout通过将生成分解为三个阶段：生成鸟瞰图布局、将其提升到3D空间以及细化物体放置。使用基于3D-Front数据集的CoT激活，并设计CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward来增强泛化和空间规划。

Result: DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化和物理可能性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: DirectLayout为解决室内场景合成问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Motivation: 为了解决基于语言和视觉的复杂查询的语义理解问题，现有的图像分割模型在用户友好的视觉语言提示驱动的应用中效果有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为“指向任何分割掩码组”（RAS）的新框架，该框架通过一个以掩码为中心的大型多模态模型增强了分割模型的多模态交互和理解。

Result: 在新的全模态指代表达分割（ORES）任务、经典指代表达分割（RES）和广义指代表达分割（GRES）任务上，RAS都表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新的MLLMs优化策略，SparseMM，它通过识别和利用视觉头部来加速视觉理解的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何MLLMs处理视觉输入，特别是通过分析其注意力机制，以识别对视觉理解有积极贡献的视觉头部。

Method: 我们分析了MLLMs的注意力机制，并设计了一个训练免费的框架来量化视觉头部的视觉相关性。我们还引入了SparseMM，这是一种基于视觉分数对LLMs头部分配不对称计算预算的KV-Cache优化策略。

Result: 我们发现只有不到5%的注意力头部在LLMs中积极贡献于视觉理解，我们称之为视觉头部。我们还设计了一个无训练框架，用于量化头部级别的视觉相关性，并引入了SparseMM，这是一种基于视觉分数对LLMs头部分配不对称计算预算的KV-Cache优化策略。

Conclusion: SparseMM在主流的多模态基准测试中实现了优异的准确度-效率权衡，在生成过程中提供了1.38倍的实时加速和52%的内存减少，同时在效率测试中保持了性能均衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

Result: 实现了在强间接光存在下的最先进的3D重建，并展示了传播光的视图合成、捕获测量的自动分解以及多视角时间解析重光照等新功能。

Conclusion: 该系统在逆渲染方面取得了突破，提高了3D重建的准确性。

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Method: 提出FreeTimeGS，允许高斯原语在任意时间和位置出现，并赋予其运动函数以减少时间冗余。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在渲染质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理在现实世界的视频设置中比在静态图像或文本中具有根本不同的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个名为VideoMathQA的基准，用于评估模型是否能够在视频中执行此类时间扩展的跨模态推理。

Result: VideoMathQA基准涵盖了10个不同的数学领域，视频时长从10秒到超过1小时。

Conclusion: 通过VideoMathQA基准，强调了现有方法的局限性，并为必须进行跨时间和多模态数学问题设置的推理的模型建立了一个系统性的评估框架。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching 通过强制所有条件流之间的唯一性来提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在条件设置中，流匹配无法保证唯一性，导致生成更模糊的结果。

Method: Contrastive Flow Matching 强制所有条件流之间的唯一性，通过最大化任意样本对预测流的差异来实现。

Result: Contrastive Flow Matching 提高了训练速度，减少了去噪步骤，并降低了FID。

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching 通过强制所有条件流之间的唯一性来增强条件分离，提高了训练速度，减少了去噪步骤，并降低了FID。

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

Motivation: 由于公开可用的Verilog代码量远少于软件语言如Python，因此需要增加可用的Verilog代码量。

Method: 提出hdl2v数据集，通过将VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3编译成Verilog来增加可用的Verilog代码量。

Result: hdl2v提高了LLM Verilog生成性能，并通过数据增强方法提高了性能。

Conclusion: 我们展示了hdl2v在提高LLM Verilog生成性能方面的价值，并分析了数据集的特征，以了解未来工作如何进一步改进性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Conclusion: 提出QiMeng系统，实现处理器芯片的软硬件自动设计，解决设计挑战。

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为ROSGuard的高便携性、模块化的定时干扰监控和控制机制，在基于ROS2的应用上实现了有效的带宽调节方案，与现有解决方案相比具有可比性。

Abstract: Multicore timing interference, arising when multiple requests contend for the
same shared hardware resources, is a primary concern for timing verification
and validation of time-critical applications. Bandwidth control and regulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature as an effective method to
monitor and limit the impact of timing interference at run time. These
approaches seek for fine-grained control of the bandwidth consumption (at the
microsecond level) to meet stringent timing requirements on embedded critical
systems. Such granularity and configurations, while effective, can become an
entry barrier for the application of bandwidth control to a wide class of
productized, modular ROS2 applications. This is so because those applications
have less stringent timing requirements but would still benefit from bandwidth
regulation, though under less restrictive, and therefore more portable,
granularity and configurations.
  In this work, we provide ROSGuard, a highly-portable, modular implementation
of a timing interference monitoring and control mechanism that builds on the
abstractions available on top of a generic and portable Linux-based software
stack with the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS2) layer, a widespreadedly
adopted middleware for a wide class of industrial applications, far beyond the
robotic domain. We deploy ROSGuard on an NVIDIA AGX Orin platform as a
representative target for functionally rich distributed AI-based applications
and a set of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We apply an effective
bandwidth regulation scheme on ROS2-based applications and achieve comparable
effectiveness to specialized, finer-grained state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: For a graph $G$ spanning a metric space, the dilation of a pair of points is
the ratio of their distance in the shortest path graph metric to their distance
in the metric space. Given a graph $G$ and a budget $k$, a classic problem is
to augment $G$ with $k$ additional edges to reduce the maximum dilation.
  In this note, we consider a variant of this problem where the goal is to
reduce the average dilation for pairs of points in $G$. We provide an $O(k)$
approximation algorithm for this problem, matching the approximation ratio
given by prior work for the maximum dilation variant.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing $\ell$-page queue layouts, which are

Inspired by previous work in the extension of stack layouts, here we consider
the setting of extending a partial $\ell$-page queue layout into a complete one
and primarily analyze the problem through the refined lens of parameterized
complexity. We obtain novel algorithms and lower bounds which provide a
detailed picture of the problem's complexity under various measures of
incompleteness, and identify surprising distinctions between queue and stack
layouts in the extension setting.

Abstract: We introduce beyond-worst-case analysis into symbolic computation. This is an
extensive field which almost entirely relies on worst-case bit complexity, and
we start from a basic problem in the field: isolating the real roots of
univariate polynomials. This is a fundamental problem in symbolic computation
and it is arguably one of the most basic problems in computational mathematics.
The problem has a long history decorated with numerous ingenious algorithms and
furnishes an active area of research. However, most available results in
literature either focus on worst-case analysis in the bit complexity model or
simply provide experimental benchmarking without any theoretical justifications
of the observed results. We aim to address the discrepancy between practical
performance of root isolation algorithms and prescriptions of worst-case
complexity theory: We develop a smoothed analysis framework for polynomials
with integer coefficients to bridge this gap. We demonstrate (quasi-)linear
(expected and smoothed) complexity bounds for Descartes algorithm, that is one
most well know symbolic algorithms for isolating the real roots of univariate
polynomials with integer coefficients. Our results explain the surprising
efficiency of Descartes solver in comparison to sophisticated algorithms that
have superior worst-case complexity. We also analyse the Sturm solver, ANewDsc
a symbolic-numeric algorithm that combines Descartes with Newton operator, and
a symbolic algorithm for sparse polynomials.

TL;DR: cGSA是一种新型AI驱动框架，通过上下文感知途径优先级提高了基因集分析的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GSA方法忽略临床上下文的问题，提高GSA的可靠性和可重复性。

Method: cGSA是一种新的AI驱动框架，通过整合基因簇检测、富集分析和大型语言模型来识别既具有统计学显著性又具有生物学意义的途径。

Result: 在102个手动 curated 基因集和19种疾病以及10种疾病相关生物机制上的基准测试表明，cGSA在基准方法上提升了30%以上。

Conclusion: cGSA通过结合上下文感知途径优先级，提高了GSA的准确性，并在基准方法上提升了30%以上。专家验证证实了其更高的精确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于扩散转换器的去噪框架，用于加速头颈癌的IMPT剂量计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决头颈癌中强度调制质子治疗（IMPT）对解剖变化的敏感性，需要频繁进行在线自适应放射治疗（oART）。

Method: 我们开发了一个基于扩散转换器的去噪框架。使用MCsquare生成噪声和高统计剂量图，并将数据标准化、归一化和转换成准高斯分布。使用混合损失函数（均方误差、残差损失和区域MAE）进行训练。

Result: 模型在头颈、肺、乳腺和前列腺癌病例中实现了较低的MAE和较高的3D伽玛通过率。DVH指数与地面真实值非常接近。

Conclusion: 开发了一种基于扩散转换器的去噪框架，尽管仅在头颈数据上训练，但具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Result: 系统调查关于双转型学术和灰色文献，阐明关键概念，为研究人员和从业者提供创新方向的线索。

Conclusion: 信息系统工程必须找到方法，通过其大量的知识、方法和技巧来支持双转型之旅。

Abstract: Twin transition is the method of parallel digital and sustainability
transitions in a mutually supporting way or, in common terms, "greening of and
by IT and data." Twin transition reacts to the growing problem of unsustainable
digitalization, particularly in the ecological sense. Ignoring this problem
will eventually limit the digital adeptness of society and the problem-solving
capacity of humankind. Information systems engineering must find ways to
support twin transition journeys through its substantial body of knowledge,
methods, and techniques. To this end, we systematically survey the academic and
gray literature on twin transition, clarify key concepts, and derive leads for
researchers and practitioners to steer their innovation efforts.

Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making
processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence
opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states.
Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference,
a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of
historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental
properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results
demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence
and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also
addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This
enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world
scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological
approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both
theoretical significance and practical applications.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨社会经济和人口因素如何影响犯罪受害者类型。

Result: 研究发现，高收入和教育水平降低了暴力犯罪的几率，而年轻男性、少数族裔和郊区地区面临更高的暴力犯罪风险。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在都市地区进行教育投资、在农村社区提供经济支持以及实施针对特定人口的预防策略的必要性。

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Motivation: 非洲政治碎片化对有效治理和稳定构成重大挑战。传统的政党体系碎片化指标，如有效政党数（ENP）指数，往往无法捕捉非洲政治景观的细微现实，特别是主导政党的影响、流动的政党归属以及种族和地区裂痕的影响。为了解决这些局限性，本文提出了两种新的“非政治”或“制度中立”的有效政党数计算方法，重点关注地理和人口维度，特别是人口规模和领土面积。通过纳入这些当地现实并确保至少有两个政党的最低门槛，所提出的模型提供了一个更简单、更符合当地情况的框架，用于理解非洲的政治动态，尤其是在数据稀缺的环境中。这种方法为分析和简化政治体系提供了一种有价值的工具，具有超越非洲背景的更广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Political fragmentation in Africa poses to a significant challenge to
effective governance and stability. Traditional measures of party system
fragmentation, such as the Effective Number of Parties (ENP) index, often fail
to capture the nuanced realities of African political landscapes, particularly
the influence of dominant parties, fluid party affiliations, and the impact of
ethnic and regional cleavages. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces two novel "apolitical" or "institutionally neutral" measures for
calculating the effective number of parties, focusing on geographical and
demographic dimensions, notably population size and territorial area. By
incorporating these local realities and ensuring a minimum threshold of two
parties, the proposed models offer a simpler and more contextually relevant
framework for understanding political dynamics in Africa, especially in
data-scarce environments. This approach provides a valuable tool for analyzing
and streamlining political systems, with potential for broader application
beyond the African context.

Abstract: Social factors such as demographic traits and institutional prestige
structure the creation and dissemination of ideas in academic publishing. One
place these effects can be observed is in how central or peripheral a
researcher is in the coauthorship network. Here we investigate inequities in
network centrality in a hand-collected data set of 5,670 U.S.-based faculty
employed in Ph.D.-granting Computer Science departments and their DBLP
coauthorship connections. We introduce algorithms for combining name- and
perception-based demographic labels by maximizing alignment with self-reported
demographics from a survey of faculty from our census. We find that women and
individuals with minoritized race identities are less central in the computer
science coauthorship network, implying worse access to and ability to spread
information. Centrality is also highly correlated with prestige, such that
faculty in top-ranked departments are at the core and those in low-ranked
departments are in the peripheries of the computer science coauthorship
network. We show that these disparities can be mitigated using simulated edge
interventions, interpreted as facilitated collaborations. Our intervention
increases the centrality of target individuals, chosen independently of the
network structure, by linking them with researchers from highly ranked
institutions. When applied to scholars during their Ph.D., the intervention
also improves the predicted rank of their placement institution in the academic
job market. This work was guided by an ameliorative approach: uncovering social
inequities in order to address them. By targeting scholars for intervention
based on institutional prestige, we are able to improve their centrality in the
coauthorship network that plays a key role in job placement and longer-term
academic success.

Method: 提出一种新的方法来量化并整合背景源对分类过程的贡献，提高性能而不需要模型重训练。该方法基于域适应技术，有效跨越了各种背景和SNR条件。

Result: 新方法提高了分类性能，有效跨越了各种背景和SNR条件。分析了音频和文本嵌入之间的模态差距，表明缩小差距可以改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 提出一种新的方法来量化并整合背景源对分类过程的贡献，提高性能而不需要模型重训练。方法有效跨越了各种背景和SNR条件，同时缩小了音频和文本嵌入之间的模态差距，提高了分类性能。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Result: 通过使用该基准，系统优化和比较了各种模型无关的后处理解释方法，在某些情况下获得了接近完美的解释。

Conclusion: 这些解释有助于揭示数据或模型中的虚假相关性，并提高了对系统的信任。

Abstract: Most modern approaches for audio processing are opaque, in the sense that
they do not provide an explanation for their decisions. For this reason,
various methods have been proposed to explain the outputs generated by these
models. Good explanations can result in interesting insights about the data or
the model, as well as increase trust in the system. Unfortunately, evaluating
the quality of explanations is far from trivial since, for most tasks, there is
no clear ground truth explanation to use as reference. In this work, we propose
a benchmark for time-localized explanations for audio classification models
that uses time annotations of target events as a proxy for ground truth
explanations. We use this benchmark to systematically optimize and compare
various approaches for model-agnostic post-hoc explanation, obtaining, in some
cases, close to perfect explanations. Finally, we illustrate the utility of the
explanations for uncovering spurious correlations.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于人类计算的方法来逐步提高音乐生成算法的性能，通过用户交互进行优化。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Conclusion: 我们提出的基于LLM的音素到字母（LLM-P2G）解码在跨语言语音识别方面优于基于WFST的系统，对波兰语和德语的相对WER降低了3.6%和6.9%。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

Starting from fundamental constraints on the physical field structure, we
recently demonstrated how to capture complete spatio-temporal information about
individual petawatt laser pulses. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate
how Bayesian frameworks can leverage temporal correlations between consecutive
pulses to improve measurement precision. We then extend these concepts to
active sensing strategies that adaptively select measurements to maximize
information gain, exemplified through Bayesian autocorrelation spectroscopy.
Finally, we show how these information-optimal measurement principles naturally
extend to Bayesian optimization. This progression represents a paradigm shift
where measurement devices transition from passive data collectors to active
participants in complex experiments.

### [367] [TQml Simulator: Optimized Simulation of Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04891)
*Viacheslav Kuzmin,Basil Kyriacou,Mateusz Papierz,Mo Kordzanganeh,Alexey Melnikov*

Result: TQml Simulator在大多数情况下比Pennylane的默认.qubit模拟器快2到100倍。

Conclusion: 我们开发了TQml Simulator，这是一种高效的量子机器学习算法模拟器，可以加速该领域的整体研究。

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Motivation: 重新定义功能性的概念，从更基本和生成性的角度理解它。

Method: 引入构造定义函数（CDF）的概念，将功能性形式化为生成句法项和语义解释的双重能力。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视函数的本质及其在结构形成中的作用，这项工作有助于逻辑、语义和计算的统一理解。

Abstract: This study redefines the notion of functionality-traditionally understood as
a property of mappings or structure preservation-from a more fundamental and
generative perspective. Introducing the concept of a Construction-Defining
function (CDF), we formalize functionality as a dual capacity to generate both
syntactic terms and semantic interpretations. We provide an explicit
axiomatization of CDF based on syntactic generativity and semantic
compositionality, and further construct categorical models using initial
algebras and endofunctors to validate the generality of this concept. Through
comparative analysis with type theory, model theory, and formal semantics, we
demonstrate that functionality, in this enriched sense, serves as a
foundational principle for structural generation across diverse theoretical
domains. By reexamining the very nature of functions and their role in
structure formation, this work contributes to a unified understanding of
logic,semantics, and computation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究逻辑推演主义及其对经典逻辑的挑战。

Method: 对大卫·希尔伯特的公理系统、格哈德·根岑的自然演绎和序列演算等三个主要证明系统进行概述；通过引入和消除规则在确定逻辑常量意义中的作用来分析逻辑推演主义的核心原则；从直觉主义和修正主义角度对经典逻辑提出挑战。

Result: 提出对经典逻辑的挑战，认为某些经典原则不符合推演主义标准，从而在意义理论框架内削弱其合法性。

Conclusion: 逻辑推演主义对经典逻辑提出挑战，质疑其合法性。

Abstract: This paper undertakes a foundational inquiry into logical inferentialism with
particular emphasis on the normative standards it establishes and the
implications these pose for classical logic. The central question addressed
herein is: 'What is Logical Inferentialism & How do its Standards challenge
Classical Logic?' In response, the study begins with a survey of the three
principal proof systems that is, David Hilbert's axiomatic systems and Gerhard
Gentzen's natural deduction and his sequent calculus, thus situating logical
inferentialism within a broader proof-theoretic landscape. The investigation
then turns to the core tenets of logical inferentialism by focusing on the role
of introduction and elimination rules in determining the meaning of logical
constants. Through this framework, natural deduction is evaluated as a system
that satisfies key inferentialist virtues including harmony, conservativeness
and the subformula property. Ultimately, the paper presents challenges to
classical logic from intuitionist and revisionist perspectives by arguing that
certain classical principles fail to uphold inferentialist standards,
consequently undermining their legitimacy within a meaning-theoretic framework.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

TL;DR: 介绍了第一个精确的PB模型计数器PBMC，该计数器在PB模型计数方面优于现有最佳计数器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PB模型计数因PB公式在描述问题约束时的简洁性而受到关注。

Method: 提出了第一个精确的PB模型计数器PBMC，该计数器采用自顶向下的搜索方法和考虑变量系数的新变量决策启发式。

Result: PBMC在PB模型计数方面的性能优于PBCount、PBCounter和Ganak等现有最佳计数器。

Conclusion: 自顶向下的PB计数器设计在PB模型计数方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean model counting involves computing the number of satisfying
assignments of a given pseudo-Boolean (PB) formula. In recent years, PB model
counting has seen increased interest partly owing to the succinctness of PB
formulas over typical propositional Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form
(CNF) at describing problem constraints. In particular, the research community
has developed tools to tackle exact PB model counting. These recently developed
counters follow one of the two existing major designs for model counters,
namely the bottom-up model counter design. A natural question would be whether
the other major design, the top-down model counter paradigm, would be effective
at PB model counting, especially when the top-down design offered superior
performance in CNF model counting literature.
  In this work, we investigate the aforementioned top-down design for PB model
counting and introduce the first exact top-down PB model counter, PBMC. PBMC is
a top-down search-based counter for PB formulas, with a new variable decision
heuristic that considers variable coefficients. Through our evaluations, we
highlight the superior performance of PBMC at PB model counting compared to the
existing state-of-the-art counters PBCount, PBCounter, and Ganak. In
particular, PBMC could count for 1849 instances while the next-best competing
method, PBCount, could only count for 1773 instances, demonstrating the
potential of a top-down PB counter design.

Conclusion: 我们的系统在真实家庭环境中实现了92.61%的准确率，将由于非人类运动引起的误报率从63.1%降低到8.4%，并将CSI传输开销降低了99.72%。

Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with
minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper
presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a
large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million
commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through
this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder
the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets)
frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous
hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI)
measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates
occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and
limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these
challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through
comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16
scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy
of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to
non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead
by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting
simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While
focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various
WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research
and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi
sensing in real-world environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FLUC旨在通过集成LLMs和无人机自动驾驶系统，实现飞行网络中的自主控制。

Method: FLUC将高级自然语言命令转换为可执行的任务代码，将操作员意图与无人机行为连接起来。

Result: FLUC在代码生成和任务规划场景中使用三种LLMs进行评估，结果表明Qwen 2.5在多步骤推理方面表现优异，Gemma 2在准确性和延迟之间取得平衡，LLaMA 3.2提供更快的响应速度和较低的逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: FLUC在实时、任务驱动的控制中表现出有效性，能够解释结构化提示并自主执行特定领域的逻辑。

Abstract: This paper proposes FLUC, a modular framework that integrates open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autopilot
systems to enable autonomous control in Flying Networks (FNs). FLUC translates
high-level natural language commands into executable UAV mission code, bridging
the gap between operator intent and UAV behaviour.
  FLUC is evaluated using three open-source LLMs - Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, and LLaMA
3.2 - across scenarios involving code generation and mission planning. Results
show that Qwen 2.5 excels in multi-step reasoning, Gemma 2 balances accuracy
and latency, and LLaMA 3.2 offers faster responses with lower logical
coherence. A case study on energy-aware UAV positioning confirms FLUC's ability
to interpret structured prompts and autonomously execute domain-specific logic,
showing its effectiveness in real-time, mission-driven control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要专家对BGP知识有深入了解，而BEAR则通过自动分析提供更便捷的解决方案。

Method: BEAR采用多步骤推理过程，将表格形式的BGP数据转化为详细的文本叙述。

Result: BEAR在真实和合成数据集上均达到100%的准确性，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: BEAR通过利用大型语言模型自动生成关于检测到的BGP异常事件的综合性报告，提高了可解释性和分析精度。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于BAI-MCTS的动态信道分配算法，显著提高了密集网络中的收敛速度。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Conclusion: 分析超过70篇文章的趋势和差距，提出两个新的用例以促进NWDAF的采用和探索其货币化潜力。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索IPv6网络中反射放大攻击的AS级漏洞。

Method: 结合ICMP Time Exceeded机制进行ISAV检测，使用IPv6地址扫描识别放大器，并利用双视角进行放大验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，4,460个AS（61.36%的测量网络）缺乏ISAV部署。通过扫描约4700万个活动地址，我们在3,507个AS中发现了反射放大器。

Conclusion: 分析表明，当前的IPv6网络是反射放大攻击的理想场所，对网络安全构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks represent a cost-effective and
potent threat to network stability. While extensively studied in IPv4 networks,
DDoS implications in IPv6 remain underexplored. The vast IPv6 address space
renders brute-force scanning and amplifier testing for all active addresses
impractical. Innovatively, this work investigates AS-level vulnerabilities to
reflection amplification attacks in IPv6.
  One prerequisite for amplification presence is that it is located in a
vulnerable autonomous system (AS) without inbound source address validation
(ISAV) deployment. Hence, the analysis focuses on two critical aspects: global
detection of ISAV deployment and identification of amplifiers within vulnerable
ASes. Specifically, we develop a methodology combining ICMP Time Exceeded
mechanisms for ISAV detection, employ IPv6 address scanning for amplifier
identification, and utilize dual vantage points for amplification verification.
  Experimental results reveal that 4,460 ASes (61.36% of measured networks)
lack ISAV deployment. Through scanning approximately 47M active addresses, we
have identified reflection amplifiers in 3,507 ASes. The analysis demonstrates
that current IPv6 networks are fertile grounds for reflection amplification
attacks, alarming network security.

Conclusion: 本文展示了CBRS基于的中立主机网络在室内覆盖、吞吐量和性能方面优于传统MNO宏网络和Wi-Fi 6网络。

Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless
connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs),
suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand,
may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models,
particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private
4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable
indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the
neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the
private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance
evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6
GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6
network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant
building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior
indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices
(CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full
coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free
coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves
substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput
improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink
(UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH
deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL
throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing
only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv)
the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL
performance by 5.05x.

violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了 LLM 在多块修复中的局限，并提出了改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多块缺陷在自动修复中普遍存在，但现有技术和基准主要针对单块场景，忽略了在代码库中协调语义相关更改的附加复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种新的度量方法——块差异，用于量化补丁中编辑的变化。同时，定义了空间邻近性，以建模块在程序层次结构中的空间分布。

Result: 通过实证研究，揭示了 LLM 在处理多块修复时的成功率和分散程度的关系，并发现 LLM 在最分散的片段类别中无法成功。

Conclusion: LLM 在多块修复中的成功率和分散程度增加而下降，这突显了 LLM 能力的关键差距，并激励了具有差异感知的修复策略。

Abstract: Multi-hunk bugs, where fixes span disjoint regions of code, are common in
practice, yet remain underrepresented in automated repair. Existing techniques
and benchmarks pre-dominantly target single-hunk scenarios, overlooking the
added complexity of coordinating semantically related changes across the
codebase. In this work, we characterize HUNK4J, a dataset of multi-hunk patches
derived from 372 real-world defects. We propose hunk divergence, a metric that
quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical,
structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks
involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how
hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical
study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased
divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model
succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class. These findings highlight a
critical gap in LLM capabilities and motivate divergence-aware repair
strategies.

Abstract: Autonomous systems have gained an important role in many industry domains and
are beginning to change everyday life. However, due to dynamically emerging
applications and often proprietary constraints, there is a lack of information
about the practice of developing autonomous systems. This paper presents the
first part of the longitudinal study focused on establishing
state-of-the-practice, identifying and quantifying the challenges and benefits,
identifying the processes and standards used, and exploring verification and
validation (V&V) practices used for the development of autonomous systems. The
results presented in this paper are based on data about software systems that
have autonomous functionality and may employ model-based software engineering
(MBSwE) and reuse. These data were collected using an anonymous online survey
that was administered in 2019 and were provided by experts with experience in
development of autonomous systems and /or the use of MBSwE. Our current work is
focused on repeating the survey to collect more recent data and discover how
the development of autonomous systems has evolved over time.

Motivation: 代码审查耗时且受主观因素影响，需要自动化技术。

Method: 使用强化学习和奖励机制自动生成代码审查评论。

Result: CoRAL在生成代码审查评论方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为CoRAL的深度学习框架，利用强化学习自动生成代码审查评论。

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Conclusion: 新算法（LITE和LINE）通过简单随机选择可以匹配像DEHB这样的复杂优化器，证明了在软件工程（SE）数据中简单方法成功的原因，并指导何时应用它们，挑战了CPU密集型优化的需求。

Abstract: Traditional multi-objective optimization in software engineering (SE) can be
slow and complex. This paper introduces the BINGO effect: a novel phenomenon
where SE data surprisingly collapses into a tiny fraction of possible solution
"buckets" (e.g., only 100 used from 4,096 expected).
  We show the BINGO effect's prevalence across 39 optimization in SE problems.
Exploiting this, we optimize 10,000 times faster than state-of-the-art methods,
with comparable effectiveness. Our new algorithms (LITE and LINE), demonstrate
that simple stochastic selection can match complex optimizers like DEHB. This
work explains why simple methods succeed in SE-real data occupies a small
corner of possibilities-and guides when to apply them, challenging the need for
CPU-heavy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于相似度计算的方法在复杂、相互依赖的云环境中可能无效，而基于深度学习的方法又面临计算需求高和可解释性差的问题。

Method: KPIRoot+结合了相似性和因果关系分析，使用符号聚合近似进行紧凑的KPI表示，提高了分析效率。

Result: KPIRoot+在性能上优于八个最先进的基线，同时降低了时间成本。

Conclusion: KPIRoot+有效解决了KPIRoot在Cloud H上的两个缺点，在性能上优于八个最先进的基线，同时降低了时间成本。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of cloud systems, their performance is monitored
using KPIs (key performance indicators). When issues arise, root cause
localization identifies KPIs responsible for service degradation, aiding in
quick diagnosis and resolution. Traditional methods rely on similarity
calculations, which can be ineffective in complex, interdependent cloud
environments. While deep learning-based approaches model these dependencies
better, they often face challenges such as high computational demands and lack
of interpretability.
  To address these issues, KPIRoot is proposed as an efficient method combining
similarity and causality analysis. It uses symbolic aggregate approximation for
compact KPI representation, improving analysis efficiency. However, deployment
in Cloud H revealed two drawbacks: 1) threshold-based anomaly detection misses
some performance anomalies, and 2) SAX representation fails to capture
intricate variation trends. KPIRoot+ addresses these limitations, outperforming
eight state-of-the-art baselines by 2.9% to 35.7%, while reducing time cost by
34.7%. We also share our experience deploying KPIRoot in a large-scale cloud
provider's production environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析人类-人类和人类-人工智能环境中的知识转移，我们进行了一项实证研究，其中开发人员对解决问题没有人工智能支持，而另一组独立开发人员使用人工智能编码助手GitHub Copilot完成相同的任务。

Method: 我们扩展了一个现有的知识转移框架，并采用了一个半自动化的评估流程来评估两种环境中知识转移事件的不同。

Result: 我们发现两种环境中成功的知识转移事件频率相似，主题类别也重叠。两个关键发现是，开发人员对GitHub Copilot的建议比对人类配对编程伙伴的建议审查较少，但GitHub Copilot也可以微妙地提醒开发人员他们可能忽略的重要代码细节。

Conclusion: GitHub Copilot在人类-人工智能编程中具有潜在价值，但需要进一步研究以了解其有效性和潜在风险。

Abstract: Knowledge transfer is fundamental to human collaboration and is therefore
common in software engineering. Pair programming is a prominent instance. With
the rise of AI coding assistants, developers now not only work with human
partners but also, as some claim, with AI pair programmers. Although studies
confirm knowledge transfer during human pair programming, its effectiveness
with AI coding assistants remains uncertain. To analyze knowledge transfer in
both human-human and human-AI settings, we conducted an empirical study where
developer pairs solved a programming task without AI support, while a separate
group of individual developers completed the same task using the AI coding
assistant GitHub Copilot. We extended an existing knowledge transfer framework
and employed a semi-automated evaluation pipeline to assess differences in
knowledge transfer episodes across both settings. We found a similar frequency
of successful knowledge transfer episodes and overlapping topical categories
across both settings. Two of our key findings are that developers tend to
accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions with less scrutiny than those from human
pair programming partners, but also that GitHub Copilot can subtly remind
developers of important code details they might otherwise overlook.

Motivation: Ensure the completion of specific testing scenarios and explore critical app functionalities.

Method: Propose ScenGen, an LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach involving five agents.

Result: ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLMs.

Conclusion: ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLMs.

Abstract: The assurance of mobile app GUI is more and more significant. Automated GUI
testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are
still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking
the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading
to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the
manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the
basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the
semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context
based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are
generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, we
propose ScenGen, a novel LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing approach
involving five agents to respectively take responsibilities of different phases
of the manual testing process. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by
extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed
semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on
target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making
process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration
target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The
execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests
are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring
the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the
corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by
Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile
monitoring the runtime bug occurrences. ScenGen is evaluated and the results
show that ScenGen can effectively generate scenario-based GUI tests guided by
LLMs.

Result: 扩展了非马尔可夫动力学的完成时间结果。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: We study rumor spreading in dynamic random graphs. Starting with a single
informed vertex, the information flows until it reaches all the vertices of the
graph (completion), according to the following process. At each step $k$, the
information is propagated to neighbors of the informed vertices, in the $k$-th
generated random graph. The way this information propagates from vertex to
vertex at each step will depend on the ``protocol". We provide a method based
on strong stationary times to study the completion time when the graphs are
Markovian time dependent, using known results of the literature for independent
graphs. The concept of strong stationary times is then extended to
non-Markovian Dynamics using coupling from the past algorithms. This allows to
extend results on completion times for non-Markov dynamics

Conclusion: 在具有低树度图的LOCAL和子线性空间MPC模型中，我们的工作首次提出了一个o(log n)轮的常近似分配算法。

Abstract: We study the allocation problem in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC)
model. This problem is a special case of $b$-matching, in which the input is a
bipartite graph with capacities greater than $1$ in only one part of the
bipartition. We give a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate algorithm for the problem,
which runs in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \lambda})$ MPC rounds, using sublinear
space per machine and $\tilde{O}(\lambda n)$ total space, where $\lambda$ is
the arboricity of the input graph. Our result is obtained by providing a new
analysis of a LOCAL algorithm by Agrawal, Zadimoghaddam, and Mirrokni [ICML
2018], which improves its round complexity from $O(\log n)$ to $O(\log
\lambda)$. Prior to our work, no $o(\log n)$ round algorithm for
constant-approximate allocation was known in either LOCAL or sublinear space
MPC models for graphs with low arboricity.

Abstract: While online bipartite matching has gained significant attention in recent
years, existing analyses in stochastic settings fail to capture the performance
of algorithms on heterogeneous graphs, such as those incorporating inter-group
affinities or other social network structures. In this work, we address this
gap by studying online bipartite matching within the stochastic block model
(SBM). A fixed set of offline nodes is matched to a stream of online arrivals,
with connections governed probabilistically by latent class memberships. We
analyze two natural algorithms: a $\tt{Myopic}$ policy that greedily matches
each arrival to the most compatible class, and the $\tt{Balance}$ algorithm,
which accounts for both compatibility and remaining capacity. For the
$\tt{Myopic}$ algorithm, we prove that the size of the matching converges, with
high probability, to the solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE),
for which we provide a tractable approximation along with explicit error
bounds. For the $\tt{Balance}$ algorithm, we demonstrate convergence of the
matching size to a differential inclusion and derive an explicit limiting
solution. Lastly, we explore the impact of estimating the connection
probabilities between classes online, which introduces an
exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Conclusion: 本文探讨了不同单词分解对eBWT中运行数量的影响，发现单词分解的数量在最小约束下呈指数增长，并展示了在相同约束下，某些单词的运行数量比率无界。

Abstract: The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a fundamental component in many data
structures for text indexing and compression, widely used in areas such as
bioinformatics and information retrieval. The extended BWT (eBWT) generalizes
the classical BWT to multisets of strings, providing a flexible framework that
captures many BWT-like constructions. Several known variants of the BWT can be
viewed as instances of the eBWT applied to specific decompositions of a word. A
central property of the BWT, essential for its compressibility, is the number
of maximal ranges of equal letters, named runs. In this article, we explore how
different decompositions of a word impact the number of runs in the resulting
eBWT. First, we show that the number of decompositions of a word is
exponential, even under minimal constraints on the size of the subsets in the
decomposition. Second, we present an infinite family of words for which the
ratio of the number of runs between the worst and best decompositions is
unbounded, under the same minimal constraints. These results illustrate the
potential cost of decomposition choices in eBWT-based compression and underline
the challenges in optimizing run-length encoding in generalized BWT frameworks.

Motivation: 为了处理在字符串 S 中任意 k 个位置被其他字母替换的情况，即使频繁子串发生变化也难以处理或未知。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的 resilient pattern mining 算法，该算法基于高级数据结构和组合洞察。

Result: 我们提出的算法在真实大规模数据集上表现优异，证明了 resilient 子串在分析基因数据中的有用性，并且比基于动态规划的基线算法更快、更节省空间。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种用于 resilient pattern mining 的新算法，该算法在真实大规模数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Frequent pattern mining is a flagship problem in data mining. In its most
basic form, it asks for the set of substrings of a given string $S$ of length
$n$ that occur at least $\tau$ times in $S$, for some integer $\tau\in[1,n]$.
We introduce a resilient version of this classic problem, which we term the
$(\tau, k)$-Resilient Pattern Mining (RPM) problem. Given a string $S$ of
length $n$ and two integers $\tau, k\in[1,n]$, RPM asks for the set of
substrings of $S$ that occur at least $\tau$ times in $S$, even when the
letters at any $k$ positions of $S$ are substituted by other letters. Unlike
frequent substrings, resilient ones account for the fact that changes to string
$S$ are often expensive to handle or are unknown.
  We propose an exact $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$-time and $\mathcal{O}(n)$-space
algorithm for RPM, which employs advanced data structures and combinatorial
insights. We then present experiments on real large-scale datasets from
different domains demonstrating that: (I) The notion of resilient substrings is
useful in analyzing genomic data and is more powerful than that of frequent
substrings, in scenarios where resilience is required, such as in the case of
versioned datasets; (II) Our algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster
and more space-efficient than a baseline algorithm that is based on dynamic
programming; and (III) Clustering based on resilient substrings is effective.

Motivation: 超图可以表示复杂的非二元关系，但在大型超图上进行存储、传输和查询时存在挑战。

Method: 提出HyperCSA，一种针对超图的压缩方法，以支持标准查询并实现高效压缩。

Result: HyperCSA在真实世界超图上实现了26%到79%的压缩率，并且比其他方法更快。

Conclusion: HyperCSA是一种新的超图压缩方法，在保持对标准查询支持的同时，实现了26%到79%的压缩率，在实验中优于现有方法，并且可以扩展到比现有方法更大的数据集。对于常见的真实世界超图，HyperCSA比标准数据结构和其他超图压缩方法快6到40倍。

Abstract: Hypergraphs model complex, non-binary relationships like co-authorships,
social group memberships, and recommendations. Like traditional graphs,
hypergraphs can grow large, posing challenges for storage, transmission, and
query performance. We propose HyperCSA, a novel compression method for
hypergraphs that maintains support for standard queries over the succinct
representation. HyperCSA achieves compression ratios of 26% to 79% of the
original file size on real-world hypergraphs - outperforming existing methods
on all large hypergraphs in our experiments. Additionally, HyperCSA scales to
larger datasets than existing approaches. Furthermore, for common real-world
hypergraphs, HyperCSA evaluates neighbor queries 6 to 40 times faster than both
standard data structures and other hypergraph compression approaches.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Minimizers are sampling schemes with numerous applications in computational
biology. Assuming a fixed alphabet of size $\sigma$, a minimizer is defined by
two integers $k,w\ge2$ and a linear order $\rho$ on strings of length $k$ (also
called $k$-mers). A string is processed by a sliding window algorithm that
chooses, in each window of length $w+k-1$, its minimal $k$-mer with respect to
$\rho$. A key characteristic of the minimizer is its density, which is the
expected frequency of chosen $k$-mers among all $k$-mers in a random infinite
$\sigma$-ary string. Minimizers of smaller density are preferred as they
produce smaller samples with the same guarantee: each window is represented by
a $k$-mer.
  The problem of finding a minimizer of minimum density for given input
parameters $(\sigma,k,w)$ has a huge search space of $(\sigma^k)!$ and is
representable by an ILP of size $\tilde\Theta(\sigma^{k+w})$, which has
worst-case solution time that is doubly-exponential in $(k+w)$ under standard
complexity assumptions. We solve this problem in $w\cdot 2^{\sigma^k+O(k)}$
time and provide several additional tricks reducing the practical runtime and
search space. As a by-product, we describe an algorithm computing the average
density of a minimizer within the same time bound. Then we propose a novel
method of studying minimizers via regular languages and show how to find, via
the eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis over finite automata, minimizers with the
minimal density in the asymptotic case $w\to\infty$. Implementing our
algorithms, we compute the minimum density minimizers for
$(\sigma,k)\in\{(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(4,2)\}$ and \textbf{all} $w\ge 2$. The
obtained densities are compared against the average density and the theoretical
lower bounds, including the new bound presented in this paper.

Motivation: 研究Ethereum区块链块中提出的块。

Method: 分析2024年12月3日8分钟内提出的Ethereum区块链块。

Result: 独家交易占获胜块中所有交易支付费用的85%。许多用户交易被延迟。识别出两个在去中心化（DEX）和中心化交易所（CEX）之间进行套利交易的外汇机器人。

Conclusion: 研究发现，独家交易占获胜块中所有交易支付费用的85%。此外，许多用户交易被延迟，这些交易仅属于失败构建者。还识别出两个在去中心化（DEX）和中心化交易所（CEX）之间进行套利交易的外汇机器人。

Abstract: We analyze blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8
minutes on December 3rd, 2024. Our dataset comprises 38 winning blocks, 15,097
proposed blocks, 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block
pairings. We find that exclusive transactions--transactions present only in
blocks proposed by a single builder--account for 85% of the fees paid by all
transactions included in winning blocks. We also find that a surprisingly large
number of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding
cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Many such
delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two
arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges
(CEX). By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price
at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is between 3.4 and
4.2 basis points better than the contemporaneous price reported on Binance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的算法kTULA，用于解决具有超线性增长对数梯度的分布采样问题，并提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受深度学习应用中全局Lipschitz连续性条件往往不满足的启发，我们研究了从具有超线性增长对数梯度的分布中进行采样的问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于驯服Langevin动力学的新算法，称为kTULA，以解决上述采样问题，并为其性能提供了理论保证。

Result: 我们建立了在Kullback-Leibler (KL)散度中的非渐近收敛界，其收敛速度等于2-ε，ε>0，这显著改进了现有文献中的相关结果。

Conclusion: 我们的主要结果可以用来为kTULA的性能提供理论保证。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Motivation: 当前使用短曝光爆发的重建方法面临强湍流和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种深度学习方法，将100张短曝光图像实时重建为一张高质量图像。

Result: 我们的方法在感知质量方面表现出更强的鲁棒性，尤其是在斑点重建出现伪影时。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在感知质量方面表现出更强的鲁棒性，尤其是在斑点重建出现伪影时。

Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be
resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths
turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction
methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and
high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that
reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real
time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on
degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving
robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms
of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts.
An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our
method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the
best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.

Conclusion: 模型可以学习生成具有挑战性的数据分布，但在控制可懂度和保持一致的说话人身份方面存在困难。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Conclusion: ESI模式在解码速度和性能方面都有所改进，且高质问答数据集可进一步提高语音问答性能。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Conclusion: 开发AI增强的团队优化框架和实用系统，以提升团队满意度、参与度和整体绩效。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel opportunities for educational
applications that have the potential to transform traditional learning for

personalized learning experiences, more studies are needed on the design of
generative AI systems and evidence for using them in real educational settings.
In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate \texttt{Reviewriter}, a novel

reviews in German. Our study identifies three key aspects: a) we provide
insights into student needs when writing peer reviews with generative models
which we then use to develop a novel system to provide adaptive instructions b)
we fine-tune three German language models on a selected corpus of 11,925
student-written peer review texts in German and choose German-GPT2 based on
quantitative measures and human evaluation, and c) we evaluate our tool with
fourteen students, revealing positive technology acceptance based on
quantitative measures. Additionally, the qualitative feedback presents the
benefits and limitations of generative AI in peer review writing.

Abstract: Mediated by today's visual displays, information space allows users to
discover, access and interact with a wide range of digital and physical
information. The information presented in this space may be digital, physical
or a blend of both, and appear across different dimensions - such as texts,
images, 3D content and physical objects embedded within real-world environment.
Navigating within the information space often involves interacting with
mixed-dimensional entities, visually represented in both 2D and 3D. At times,
interactions also involve transitioning among entities represented in different
dimensions. We introduce the concept of mixed-dimensional information space,
encompassing entities represented in both 2D and 3D. Interactions within the
mixed-dimensional information space should be seamless and efficient: users
should be able to focus on their primary tasks without being distracted by
interactions with or transitions between entities. While incorporating 3D
representations into the mixed-dimensional information space offers intuitive
and immersive ways to interact with complex information, it is important to
address potential seams and inefficiencies that arise while interacting with
both 2D and 3D entities. This dissertation introduces new interactive
techniques and systems to realize seamless and efficient interactions within
the mixed-dimensional information space. This dissertation introduces three
interactive systems: MemoVis which aims to use emergent generative AI to help
users create reference images for 3D design feedback; PaperToPlace which
demonstrates how paper-based instruction documents can be transformed and
spatialized into a context-aware MR experience; and VRContour which explores
how contour delineation workflow can be brought into VR.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了神经元雪崩动力学作为BCI训练的稳健生物标志物的效用，支持开发旨在减轻BCI文盲的个性化协议。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) hold promise for
restoring control in individuals with motor impairments. However, up to 30% of
users remain unable to effectively use BCIs-a phenomenon termed ''BCI
inefficiency.'' This study addresses a major limitation in current BCI training
protocols: the use of fixed-length training paradigms that ignore individual
learning variability. We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal
avalanches-spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity-as biomarkers to
characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using
electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training
sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche
length and activations. These features revealed significant training and
taskcondition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in
these features across sessions ($\Delta$avalanche length and
$\Delta$activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled
prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and
Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable
improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest.
These findings demonstrate the utility of neuronal avalanche dynamics as robust
biomarkers for BCI training, supporting the development of personalized
protocols aimed at mitigating BCI illiteracy.

Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is essential in clinical settings for diagnosing
diseases, planning surgeries, and other procedures. However, manual annotation
is a cumbersome and effortful task. To mitigate these aspects, this study
implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an
extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using
the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive
interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in
a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and
cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The
platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper
workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public
craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability,
achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range
for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive
controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and
spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in
hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified
opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the
platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive
load compared to desktop tools. Results position the XR-stylus paradigm as a
promising foundation for immersive segmentation tools, with iterative
refinements targeting haptic feedback calibration and workflow personalization
to advance adoption in preoperative planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲用户在浏览在线餐厅评论时遇到的困难，如听疲劳和挫败感。

Method: QuickQue使用大型语言模型进行基于方面的联合分类，并在分组中进行聚焦摘要，生成简洁的评论者意见表示。

Result: QuickQue工具在用户研究中显示出比现状屏幕阅读器更优的整体可用性和任务工作量。

Conclusion: QuickQue工具通过方面聚焦的 sentiment 驱动摘要重新组织在线餐厅评论信息，显著提高了屏幕阅读器用户的可用性和任务工作量。

Abstract: Online reviews have become an integral aspect of consumer decision-making on
e-commerce websites, especially in the restaurant industry. Unlike sighted
users who can visually skim through the reviews, perusing reviews remains
challenging for blind users, who rely on screen reader assistive technology
that supports predominantly one-dimensional narration of content via keyboard
shortcuts. In an interview study, we uncovered numerous pain points of blind
screen reader users with online restaurant reviews, notably, the listening
fatigue and frustration after going through only the first few reviews. To
address these issues, we developed QuickQue assistive tool that performs
aspect-focused sentiment-driven summarization to reorganize the information in
the reviews into an alternative, thematically-organized presentation that is
conveniently perusable with a screen reader. At its core, QuickQue utilizes a
large language model to perform aspect-based joint classification for grouping
reviews, followed by focused summarizations within the groups to generate
concise representations of reviewers' opinions, which are then presented to the
screen reader users via an accessible interface. Evaluation of QuickQue in a
user study with 10 participants showed significant improvements in overall
usability and task workload compared to the status quo screen reader.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

TL;DR: OxO2通过改进映射和性能，提高了数据集集成的一致性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OxO的映射可能不准确，缺少来源信息，并且可能崩溃或超时。

Method: OxO2使用SSSOM定义映射的来源，并使用Nemo实现Datalog规则引擎以提高性能和内存效率。

Result: OxO2用户可以更有信心地在不同的数据集中进行集成。

Conclusion: OxO2通过实施SSSOM和Nemo解决了OxO的局限性，提高了映射的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: EMBL-EBI created OxO to enable users to map between datasets that are
annotated with different ontologies. Mappings identified by the first version
of OxO were not necessarily logically sound, missed important provenance
information such as author and reviewer, and could timeout or crash for certain
requests. In this paper we introduce OxO2 to address these concerns. Provenance
is addressed by implementing SSSOM, a mapping standard that defines provenance
for mappings. SSSOM defines the conditions under which logical sound mappings
can be derived and is implemented in OxO2 using, Nemo, a Datalog rule engine.
To ensure reasoning is performant and memory efficient, Nemo implements a
number of strategies that ensures OxO2 will be stable for all requests. Due to
these changes, OxO2 users will be able to integrate between disparate datasets
with greater confidence.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: BVLSM是一种针对大值工作负载的LSM存储系统优化方案，通过主动分离键值在WAL阶段，显著提高了RocksDB和BlobDB的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSM存储系统在大值工作负载下存在写入放大、内存利用率和I/O抖动等问题。

Method: BVLSM在WAL阶段主动分离键值，并存储轻量级元数据，以实现多队列并行存储大值。

Result: BVLSM在64KB随机写入负载下，比RocksDB和BlobDB性能提升显著，异步WAL模式下吞吐量分别提升7.6倍和1.9倍。

Conclusion: BVLSM是解决LSM存储系统在大值工作负载下性能瓶颈的有效方法。

Abstract: Modern data-intensive applications increasingly store and process big-value
items, such as multimedia objects and machine learning embeddings, which
exacerbate storage inefficiencies in Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM)-based
key-value stores. This paper presents BVLSM, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL)-time
key-value separation mechanism designed to address three key challenges in
LSM-Tree storage systems: write amplification, poor memory utilization, and I/O
jitter under big-value workloads. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that delay
key-value separation until the flush stage, leading to redundant data in
MemTables and repeated writes. BVLSM proactively decouples keys and values
during the WAL phase. The MemTable stores only lightweight metadata, allowing
multi-queue parallel store for big value. The benchmark results show that BVLSM
significantly outperforms both RocksDB and BlobDB under 64KB random write
workloads. In asynchronous WAL mode, it achieves throughput improvements of
7.6x over RocksDB and 1.9x over BlobDB.

TL;DR: 本文研究了缓存配置问题，提出了一种基于多选择背包问题的解决方案，并评估了不同设计决策对系统性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高缓存内存层次结构的整体系统性能，在内存故障时具有更快的恢复时间。

Method: 将缓存配置问题建模为多选择背包问题（MCKP），使用线性规划松弛近似最优解。

Result: 在键值存储（如memcached）和主机端缓存（如Flashcache）的情况下，评估了设计权衡。

Conclusion: 在特定失败率和工作负载特征下，选择性地复制是合适的。在低失败率和频繁数据更新的情况下，将数据分层存储在不同存储媒体上优于复制。

Abstract: Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a
new storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid
State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of
options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to
replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may
enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event
of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:
Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage
capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the
different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions
as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is
guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's
database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its
linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to
closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm
to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a
Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,
Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain
failure rates and workload characteristics. With a slim failure rate and
frequent data updates, tiering of data across the different storage media that
constitute the cache is superior to replication.

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个用于抗体结合亲和力成熟和设计的基准测试框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供一个统一、基于生物学的评估框架，以促进更有效、功能感知的抗体设计模型的发展。

Method: AbBiBench通过评估抗体-抗原复合物中蛋白质模型的似然性来评估抗体设计的结合潜力。

Result: 结构条件下的逆折叠模型在亲和力相关和生成任务中都优于其他模型。

Conclusion: AbBiBench提供了一个统一、基于生物学的评估框架，以促进更有效、功能感知的抗体设计模型的发展。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如何通过统一的、层次化的流形来对异构证据进行解释，以揭示疾病进展和治疗干预的轨迹。

Method: 提出了一种基于潜在空间假设的方法，将每个观察值视为一个统一的、层次化的流形的投影，从而在共享空间中解释异构证据。

Result: 该框架为个性化诊断、纵向监测和定制治疗提供了定量依据，将临床实践从基于可能具有误导性的标签的分类转向对每个人独特轨迹的导航。

Conclusion: 该方法有望解决偏置放大、罕见疾病数据稀缺、隐私和相关性-因果关系分裂等挑战。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

TL;DR: Error: Failed to generate summary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: None

Method: None

Result: None

Conclusion: None

Abstract: We address a fundamental problem in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, namely,
constructing and maintaining dynamic P2P overlay network topologies with
essential properties such as connectivity, low diameter, and high expansion,
that are resilient to continuous high churn and the presence of a large number
of malicious (Byzantine) nodes. Our main goal is to construct and maintain a
sparse (bounded degree) expander topology despite high churn and a large number
of Byzantine nodes. Such an expander topology has logarithmic diameter, high
expansion, and is robust to churn and the presence of a large number of bad
nodes, and facilitates efficient and robust algorithms for fundamental problems
in distributed computing, such as agreement, broadcasting, routing, etc.
  Our main contribution is a randomized, fully-distributed dynamic P2P protocol
that works with only local initial knowledge and guarantees, with a high
probability, the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion
even under continuous churn and in the presence of a large number of Byzantine
nodes. Our protocol can tolerate up to $o(n/poly\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes
(where $n$ is the stable network size). Our protocol is efficient, lightweight,
and scalable, and it incurs only $O(poly\log(n))$ overhead for topology
maintenance: only polylogarithmic (in $n$) bits need to be processed and sent
by each honest node per round, and any honest node's computation cost per round
is also polylogarithmic.
  Our protocol can be used as a building block for solving fundamental
distributed computing problems in highly dynamic networks, such as Byzantine
agreement and Byzantine leader election, and enables fast and scalable
algorithms for these problems.

Conclusion: KATO在降低计算开销的同时，实现了最优或近似最优的性能，并且在不同规模和配置的网络中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vehicle edge computing (VEC) brings abundant computing resources close to
vehicles by deploying them at roadside units (RSUs) or base stations, thereby
enabling diverse computation-intensive and delay sensitive applications.
Existing task offloading strategies are often computationally expensive to
execute or generate suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel
learning-based approach, Knowledge-guided Attention-inspired Task Offloading
(KATO), designed to efficiently offload tasks from moving vehicles to nearby
RSUs. KATO integrates an attention-inspired encoder-decoder model for selecting
a subset of RSUs that can reduce overall task processing time, along with an
efficient iterative algorithm for computing optimal task allocation among the
selected RSUs. Simulation results demonstrate that KATO achieves optimal or
near-optimal performance with significantly lower computational overhead and
generalizes well across networks of varying sizes and configurations.

Motivation: 为了克服现有MoE模型的局限性，如低GPU利用率、显著的延迟开销和无法利用任务局部性等。

Method: 开发了一个名为FlashDMoE的完全GPU驻留的MoE算子，该算子将专家计算和GPU间通信融合为一个持久的GPU内核。

Result: FlashDMoE实现了更低的延迟、更高的吞吐量、更好的弱扩展效率和更高的GPU利用率。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE证明了原则性的GPU内核-硬件协同设计对于解锁大规模分布式机器学习工作负载的性能上限至关重要。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Abstract: Backscatter system is a system based on backscatter communication technology,
which is a low cost, low power consumption and easy to deploy communication
technology. At present, the backscatter technology is mainly applied to RFID

optimization for heterogeneous environments. This paper presents GreenPod, a
TOPSIS-based scheduler optimizing pod placement based on execution time, energy
consumption, processing core, memory availability, and resource balance. Tested
on a heterogeneous Google Kubernetes cluster, GreenPod improves energy
efficiency by up to 39.1% over the default Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler,
particularly with energy-centric weighting schemes. Medium complexity workloads
showed the highest energy savings, despite slight scheduling latency. GreenPod
effectively balances sustainability and performance for AIoT applications.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol for adaptive adversaries. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed computing. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine adversary. 

Method: This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol under an adaptive adversary. The protocol runs in O(min{t^2logn/n, t/logn}) rounds. 

Result: The protocol improves over previous results and runs in O(min{t^2logn/n, t/logn}) rounds. 

Conclusion: The protocol improves over previous results and runs in O(min{t^2logn/n, t/logn}) rounds. 

Abstract: Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed
computing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of
the research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary
is constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's
execution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine
adversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \emph{adaptively} based on the
protocol's execution. While efficient $O(\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the
total number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov,
and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\epsilon)$ Byzantine
nodes, $\Omega(t/\sqrt{n \log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for
adaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol
for adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans.
Soft. Engg., 1985].
  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol
under an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol
works under the powerful \emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full
information model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave
arbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对增强指数门算术电路的恒等性测试算法，该算法在数学上简单，并且在实际应用中表现出良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在神经网络优化编译器设计中解决实际问题，我们开始研究增强指数门算术电路的恒等性测试问题。

Method: 我们正式化了一个针对这类电路的有限域上的黑盒查询模型，该模型在数学上简单且反映了现实世界神经网络编译器面临的约束。

Result: 我们证明了简单而高效的随机恒等性测试算法实现了完美的完备性和非平凡的可靠性。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一个数论猜想，根据这个猜想，我们的算法以高概率是可靠的。

Abstract: Motivated by practical applications in the design of optimization compilers
for neural networks, we initiated the study of identity testing problems for
arithmetic circuits augmented with \emph{exponentiation gates} that compute the
real function $x\mapsto e^x$. These circuits compute real functions of form
$P(\vec x)/P'(\vec x)$, where both $P(\vec x)$ and $P'(\vec x)$ are exponential
polynomials
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k f_i(\vec x)\cdot \exp\left(\frac{g_i(\vec x)}{h_i(\vec
x)}\right),
  \]
  for polynomials $f_i(\vec x),g_i(\vec x)$, and $h_i(\vec x)$.
  We formalize a black-box query model over finite fields for this class of
circuits, which is mathematical simple and reflects constraints faced by
real-world neural network compilers. We proved that a simple and efficient
randomized identity testing algorithm achieves perfect completeness and
non-trivial soundness. Concurrent with our work, the algorithm has been
implemented in the optimization compiler Mirage by Wu et al.~(OSDI 2025),
demonstrating promising empirical performance in both efficiency and soundness
error. Finally, we propose a number-theoretic conjecture under which our
algorithm is sound with high probability.

Conclusion: 通过单调性测试确定刚性弹性障碍物的形状和位置，无需初始猜测或背景介质的物理参数知识。

Abstract: We consider the elastic wave scattering problem involving rigid obstacles.
This work addresses the inverse problem of reconstructing the position and
shape of such obstacles using far-field measurements. A novel
monotonicity-based approach is developed for this purpose. By factorizing the
far-field operator and utilizing the existence of localized wave functions, we
derive a shape characterization criterion for the obstacle boundary. The
proposed method employs monotonicity tests to determine the geometric
relationship between any given test domain and the actual scatterer. As a
result, the shape and location of rigid elastic obstacles can be uniquely
identified without requiring any initial guesses or prior knowledge of the
physical parameters of the homogeneous background medium.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Abstract: The construction industry is a major consumer of raw materials, accounting
for nearly half of global material usage annually, while generating significant
waste that poses sustainability challenges. This paper explores the untapped
potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging
their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced
applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow,
the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed
chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating
their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use.
  Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled
plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional
testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum
constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as
the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity,
material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for
temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing
material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency.
  The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme
conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments,
underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications
leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled
plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste
management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in
harsh and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在实验数据充足的情况下，即使在高测量噪声的情况下也能取得满意的结果。

Abstract: This paper presents a Finite Element Model Updating framework for identifying
heterogeneous material distributions in planar Bernoulli-Euler beams based on a
rotation-free isogeometric formulation. The procedure follows two steps: First,
the elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then,
the density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes),
given the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on
three independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a
high-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed
of low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown
material distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The
error between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares
manner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the
trust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate
computations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are
provided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1
discretization is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data is generated
using refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4%. The
method yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of
experimental data is available, even for high measurement noise. Regularization
is used to ensure a stable solution for dense material meshes. The density can
be accurately reconstructed based on the previously identified elastic
properties. The proposed framework can be straightforwardly extended to shells
and 3D continua.

Conclusion: FinMultiTime是一个大规模、多模态金融时间序列数据集，显著提高了预测准确性，多模态融合在Transformer模型中产生适度增益，并支持数据集的无缝更新。

Abstract: Pure time series forecasting tasks typically focus exclusively on numerical
features; however, real-world financial decision-making demands the comparison
and analysis of heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in deep
learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides
in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the
accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most
existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to
a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce
FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset.
FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news,
structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time
series across both the S&P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from
2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and
provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short,
medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments
demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy;
(2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a
fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.

Result: BridgeNet在多种测试案例中显示出比传统PINN方法更低的误差指标和更快的收敛速度，同时在高维设置中保持稳健的稳定性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种稳健且高效的工具，适用于均匀网格上的自由空间泊松问题。

Abstract: We present a high-accuracy spectral method for solving the unbounded
three-dimensional Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources.
The approach is based on a super-potential formulation, where the solution is
obtained by applying the Laplacian to a convolution with the biharmonic Green's
function. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient
FFT-based computation with quasi-linear complexity. Owing to the improved
regularity of the biharmonic kernel, the GS cutoff error is of order four,
eliminating the need for correction terms or Taylor expansions required in
standard GS or Ewald-type methods. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the
method achieves machine-precision accuracy and outperforms existing GS-based
schemes in both error and runtime, making it a robust and efficient tool for
free-space Poisson problems on uniform grids.

Abstract: The modeling and simulation of multiphase fluid flow receive significant
attention in reservoir engineering. Many time discretization schemes for
multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the
decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this
study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for
simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity
and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for
spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface
conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably,
we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error
estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the
resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric
Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are
based on the open-source software: UG4. The results from parallel computations
on the supercomputer demonstrate that the scalability of our proposed framework
is sufficient, supporting a scale of thousands of processors with Degrees of
Freedom (DoF) extending up to billions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决最优控制问题，我们提出了一个简化的神经网络架构，即DeepONet，并采用了一种无需考虑成本函数的简化方法。

Method: 我们通过将基于微分方程残差的惩罚项添加到成本函数中，并使用自动微分通过训练的神经算子计算关于控制的梯度，从而实现这一目标。

Result: 我们展示了我们的方法在九个不同的最优控制问题上的性能，通过训练三个不同的DeepONet模型，每个模型对应一个不同的微分方程，并在每个模型上解决三个具有不同成本函数的问题，证明了准确和一致的性能。

Conclusion: 我们证明了在训练过程中包含成本函数是不必要的，并提倡通过将最优控制问题从训练过程中解耦来实现更简单的架构和简化方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are expected to become an increasingly important
source of flexibility for power system operations. However, accurately
capturing the flexibility potential of numerous and heterogeneous EVs remains a
significant challenge. We propose a bilevel optimization formulation to enhance
flexibility aggregations of electric vehicle fleets. The outer level minimizes
scheduling deviations between the aggregated and reference EV units, while the
inner level maximizes the aggregated unit's profits. Our approach introduces
hourly to daily scaling factor mappings to parameterize the aggregated EV
units. Compared to simple aggregation methods, the proposed framework reduces
the root-mean-square error of charging power by 78~per cent, providing more
accurate flexibility representations. The proposed framework also provides a
foundation for several potential extensions in future work.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling diffusion processes in complex networks is
critical across domains ranging from epidemiology to information science. Here,
we present ExDiff, an interactive and modular computational framework that
integrates network simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs), and explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to model and interpret diffusion dynamics. ExDiff
combines classical compartmental models with deep learning techniques to
capture both the structural and temporal characteristics of diffusion across
diverse network topologies. The framework features dedicated modules for
network analysis, neural modeling, simulation, and interpretability, all
accessible via an intuitive interface built on Google Colab. Through a case
study of the Susceptible Infectious Recovered Vaccinated Dead (SIRVD) model, we
demonstrate the capacity to simulate disease spread, evaluate intervention
strategies, classify node states, and reveal the structural determinants of
contagion through XAI techniques. By unifying simulation and interpretability,
ExDiff provides a powerful, flexible, and accessible platform for studying
diffusion phenomena in networked systems, enabling both methodological
innovation and practical insight.

Motivation: 洗钱对全球经济造成重大挑战，需要有效的反洗钱工具。

Result: GARG-AML在大型合成和开源网络上进行了实验评估，证明其有效性。

Conclusion: GARG-AML在检测洗钱活动中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Motivation: 尽管先前的研究已经确定了社交技能和熟悉度是团队成功的关键驱动因素，但由于数据和方法的限制，它们在临时团队中的联合效应仍没有得到充分研究。

Method: 研究通过分析来自即时策略游戏《帝国时代II》的大型面板数据集来解决这个问题。玩家被准随机分配到临时团队中，在动态、高压条件下必须协调。通过比较观察到的比赛结果和基于任务熟练度的预测，研究分离了个人贡献。

Result: 研究发现了一个强大的“团队玩家效应”：某些个人在技术技能预测之外，一致地改善了团队的结果。这种效应通过团队熟悉度而显著增强，拥有先前共同经验的团队从这样的人的存在的受益更多。此外，这种效应随着团队规模的增加而增加，表明随着协调需求的增加，社交技能变得越来越有价值。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，社交技能和熟悉度以互补而非累加的方式相互作用。这些发现有助于了解团队表现文献，通过记录准随机、高风险环境中团队玩家效应的强度和结构，对组织和工作市场中的团队合作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential in structured, performance-driven
environments, from professional organizations to high-stakes competitive
settings. As tasks grow more complex, achieving high performance requires not
only technical proficiency but also strong interpersonal skills that allow
individuals to coordinate effectively within teams. While prior research has
identified social skills and familiarity as key drivers of team success, their
joint effects -- particularly in temporary teams -- remain underexplored due to
data and methodological constraints. To address this gap, we analyze a
large-scale panel dataset from the real-time strategy game Age of Empires II,
where players are assigned quasi-randomly to temporary teams and must
coordinate under dynamic, high-pressure conditions. We isolate individual
contributions by comparing observed match outcomes with predictions based on
task proficiency. Our findings confirm a robust 'team player effect': certain
individuals consistently improve team outcomes beyond what their technical
skills predict. This effect is significantly amplified by team familiarity --
teams with prior shared experience benefit more from the presence of such
individuals. Moreover, the effect grows with team size, suggesting that social
skills become increasingly valuable as coordination demands rise. Our results
demonstrate that social skills and familiarity interact in a complementary,
rather than additive, way. These findings contribute to the literature on team
performance by documenting the strength and structure of the team player effect
in a quasi-randomized, high-stakes setting, with implications for teamwork in
organizations and labor markets.

Abstract: Online social media platforms are often seen as catalysts for radicalization,
as they provide spaces where extreme beliefs can take root and spread,
sometimes leading to real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories represent a
specific form of radicalization that is notoriously resistant to online
moderation strategies. One explanation for this resilience is the presence of a
"conspiratorial mindset", a cognitive framework that fundamentally shapes how
conspiracy believers perceive reality. However, the role of this mindset in
driving online user behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we
analyze the psycholinguistic patterns of Reddit users who become active in a
prominent conspiracy community by examining their activity in mainstream
communities, which allows us to isolate linguistic markers for the presence of
a conspiratorial mindset. We find that conspiracy-engaged individuals exhibit
distinct psycholinguistic fingerprints, setting them apart from the general
user population. Crucially, this signal is already evident in their online
activity prior to joining the conspiracy community, allowing us to predict
their involvement years in advance. These findings suggest that individuals who
adopt conspiracy beliefs do not radicalize through community involvement, but
possess a pre-existing conspiratorial mindset, which predisposes them to seek
out and join extreme communities. By challenging the view that online social
media platforms actively radicalize users into conspiracy theory beliefs, our
findings suggest that standard moderation strategies have limited impact on
curbing radicalization, and highlight the need for more targeted, supportive
interventions that encourage disengagement from extremist narratives.
Ultimately, this work contributes to fostering safer online and offline
environments for public discourse.

Result: 对于中等规模测试案例和大规模实际问题，在种群规模方面显示出比经典算法的明显优势。然而，观察到对于大规模实际问题，程序运行时间较长，这是由于经典模拟的限制，需要未来的真正量子计算。此外，结果也重新验证了传统经典遗传算法的稳定性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Among the genetic algorithms generally used for optimization problems in the
recent decades, quantum-inspired variants are known for fast and high-fitness
convergence and small resource requirement. Here the application to the patient
scheduling problem in proton therapy is reported. Quantum chromosomes are
tailored to possess the superposed data of patient IDs and gantry statuses.
Selection and repair strategies are also elaborated for reliable convergence to
a clinically feasible schedule although the employed model is not complex.
Clear advantage in population size is shown over the classical counterpart in
our numerical results for both a medium-size test case and a large-size
practical problem instance. It is, however, observed that program run time is
rather long for the large-size practical case, which is due to the limitation
of classical emulation and demands the forthcoming true quantum computation.
Our results also revalidate the stability of the conventional classical genetic
algorithm.

Conclusion: 基于神经演化的方法更适合设计符合两种形态的控制器，NEAT在所有测试场景中表现更优，并生成更易于实施的简化网络。

Abstract: Since soft robotics are composed of compliant materials, they perform better
than conventional rigid robotics in specific fields, such as medical
applications. However, the field of soft robotics is fairly new, and the design
process of their morphology and their controller strategies has not yet been
thoroughly studied. Consequently, here, an automated design method for the
controller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed. Specifically,
the suggested techniques employ Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) to generate the synchronization profile of
the components of a simulated soft actuator by employing Compositional Pattern
Producing Networks (CPPNs). As a baseline methodology, a Standard Genetic
Algorithm (SGA) was used. Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed
methodologies, both high- and low-performing morphologies of soft actuators
were utilized as testbeds. Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited
set of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested
throughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that
Neuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing
controllers that align with both types of morphologies. In specific, NEAT
performed better for all different scenarios tested and produced more
simplistic networks that are easier to implement in real life applications.

We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers

concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中忽略实例中心区分度的不足。

Method: VoxDet使用空间解耦的Voxel编码器生成特征体积，并使用任务解耦的密集预测器进行密集检测。

Result: VoxDet在SemanticKITTI测试集上取得了63.0的IoU，排名第一。

Conclusion: VoxDet通过将3D占用预测重新定义为密集对象检测，在语义分割任务上取得了最先进的成果。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种快速无监督的多边形逼近闭合数字曲线的方案。该方案在速度上优于现有方法，并且在Rosin度量及其美学方面具有竞争力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

Conclusion: 提出了一种接触交互方法，用于无偏处理接触表面，并通过与解析解的对比验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased
treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and
slave. The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are
evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining
the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of
true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their
integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A
meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of
interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better
traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch
test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the
capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and
sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch
test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy
levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with
mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested
for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.
Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as
oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the
algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal
meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact
problems.

Conclusion: NeuroMix模拟器在EVD放置方面提高了操作精度，且三种训练模式都受到用户好评。

Abstract: Neurosurgery increasingly uses Mixed Reality (MR) technologies for
intraoperative assistance. The greatest challenge in this area is mentally
reconstructing complex 3D anatomical structures from 2D slices with millimetric
precision, which is required in procedures like External Ventricular Drain
(EVD) placement. MR technologies have shown great potential in improving
surgical performance, however, their limited availability in clinical settings
underscores the need for training systems that foster skill retention in
unaided conditions. In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator
for EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact
of 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance,
and procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are
compared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining
both 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital
objects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a
physical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the
participants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo
training. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids
achieve a 44\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the
control group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other
groups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology
acceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination
of 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload,
though it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to
the control group.

Result: 该方法在隐式 signed distance 函数中表现良好，且比其他方法更高效。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Randomly sampling points on surfaces is an essential operation in geometry
processing. This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit
meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as
widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme
for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the
intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine
to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that
subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach
is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions,
where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points,
without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to
show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is
significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of
representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and
stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as
well as moment estimation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 我们分析了YouTube数据API的行为，发现搜索端点返回的结果不一致，并提出了建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管YouTube非常受欢迎，并且对其进行了大量研究，但对YouTube数据API，尤其是搜索端点的运作方式了解甚少。

Method: 我们对API的行为进行了分析，通过在12周内运行相同的查询。

Result: 我们发现搜索端点返回的结果在查询之间高度不一致，API似乎根据查询期间各个主题的相对流行度随机化返回的视频。

Conclusion: 我们分析了YouTube数据API的行为，发现搜索端点返回的结果在查询之间高度不一致，并且没有正式记录。API似乎根据查询期间各个主题的相对流行度随机化返回的视频，这使得在非高峰主题期间几乎不可能获得代表性的历史视频样本。我们的结果还表明，API可能会优先考虑较短、更受欢迎的视频，尽管频道流行度的作用并不明确。我们提出了研究人员使用API进行数据收集的策略建议，以及未来API用例扩展的研究方向。

Abstract: YouTube is among the most widely-used platforms worldwide, and has seen a lot
of recent academic attention. Despite its popularity and the number of studies
conducted on it, much less is understood about the way in which YouTube's Data
API, and especially the Search endpoint, operates. In this paper, we analyze
the API's behavior by running identical queries across a period of 12 weeks.
Our findings suggest that the search endpoint returns highly inconsistent
results between queries in ways that are not officially documented.
Specifically, the API seems to randomize returned videos based on the relative
popularity of the respective topic during the query period, making it nearly
impossible to obtain representative historical video samples, especially during
non-peak topical periods. Our results also suggest that the API may prioritize
shorter, more popular videos, although the role of channel popularity is not as
clear. We conclude with suggested strategies for researchers using the API for
data collection, as well as future research directions on expanding the API's
use-cases.

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: R2Rec是一种推理增强的推荐框架，通过模拟基于隐式模式的逐步决策，提高了推荐系统的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户反馈是隐式的且缺乏推理监督，直接应用推理方法到推荐中是无效的。

Method: R2Rec通过从用户-项目图中采样交互链，并通过渐进式掩码提示策略将它们转换为结构化的交互思维，以增强LLM的推理能力。

Result: R2Rec在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，它优于基于LLM的基线。

Conclusion: R2Rec在HitRatio@1上平均提高了10.48%，在原始LLM上提高了131.81%。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人格的推荐系统评估方法，通过模拟用户行为来提高评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统离线评估方法难以捕捉现代平台的复杂性，因为行为信号稀疏、数据嘈杂以及对用户个性特征的建模有限。

Method: 提出基于人格驱动的用户行为模拟器（PUB），一个基于LLM的模拟框架，整合了五大人格特质来模拟个性化用户行为。PUB从行为日志（例如，评分、评论）和项目元数据中动态推断用户个性，然后生成保留了对现实世界数据的统计一致性的合成交互。

Result: 在亚马逊评论数据集上的实验表明，PUB生成的日志与真实用户行为紧密一致，并揭示了人格特质与推荐结果之间的有意义关联。

Conclusion: 该研究为推荐系统评估提供了新的思路，有助于提高评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Traditional offline evaluation methods for recommender systems struggle to
capture the complexity of modern platforms due to sparse behavioural signals,
noisy data, and limited modelling of user personality traits. While simulation
frameworks can generate synthetic data to address these gaps, existing methods
fail to replicate behavioural diversity, limiting their effectiveness. To
overcome these challenges, we propose the Personality-driven User Behaviour
Simulator (PUB), an LLM-based simulation framework that integrates the Big Five
personality traits to model personalised user behaviour. PUB dynamically infers
user personality from behavioural logs (e.g., ratings, reviews) and item
metadata, then generates synthetic interactions that preserve statistical
fidelity to real-world data. Experiments on the Amazon review datasets show
that logs generated by PUB closely align with real user behaviour and reveal
meaningful associations between personality traits and recommendation outcomes.
These results highlight the potential of the personality-driven simulator to
advance recommender system evaluation, offering scalable, controllable,
high-fidelity alternatives to resource-intensive real-world experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Exp4Fuse的新框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展来增强稀疏检索器的性能，在多个数据集上实现了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高稀疏检索器的性能，降低成本和计算复杂度。

Method: 设计了一种名为Exp4Fuse的新框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展同时考虑两种检索路径，并使用稀疏检索器和改进的倒数排名融合方法生成两个排名列表。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse在增强稀疏检索器的性能方面优于现有方法，并与高级稀疏检索器结合时在多个基准测试中达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在提高稀疏检索查询扩展方面表现出色，有效降低了成本和计算复杂度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: GOLFer 是一种利用较小语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，它在信息检索方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的查询扩展方法成本高、计算密集且可访问性有限。

Method: GOLFer 包括幻觉过滤器和文档组合器两个模块，用于检测和删除生成的文档中的非事实和矛盾句子，并使用权重向量将过滤后的内容与查询相结合。

Result: GOLFer 在三个网络搜索和十个低资源数据集上评估，结果表明其优于其他使用较小语言模型的方法，并与使用大型语言模型的方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GOLFer 在使用较小语言模型的情况下，在信息检索查询扩展方面表现出色，并可与大型语言模型相媲美。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在可视化文档检索（VDR）中表现出色，但其内存使用过高。本研究旨在减少每页的补丁嵌入数量，同时最小化性能下降。

Method: 我们评估了两种标记减少策略：标记修剪和标记合并。对于标记修剪，我们发现简单的随机策略优于其他复杂的修剪方法。对于标记合并，我们探索了合并策略的最佳组合，开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在98.2%的检索性能下，仅使用11.8%的原始内存，在2.8%的内存占用下保持94.6%的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的实证研究发现，通过合并策略，可以显著降低内存使用，同时保持检索性能。Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在98.2%的检索性能下，仅使用11.8%的原始内存，在2.8%的内存占用下保持94.6%的有效性。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Method: 我们提出MACL，一种新型的多模态自适应对比学习框架。在MACL中，我们设计了多模态增强方法以生成语义一致的项目和会话视图，并提出了一种自适应对比损失来区分正负信号的贡献。

Conclusion: 我们提出了MACL，一种新型的多模态自适应对比学习框架，用于解决现有基于对比学习的会话推荐方法中存在的三个问题：忽视项目级稀疏性、语义一致性保证不足以及正负信号贡献不均。实验表明MACL优于现有方法。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict intents of anonymous users based
on limited behaviors. With the ability in alleviating data sparsity,
contrastive learning is prevailing in the task. However, we spot that existing
contrastive learning based methods still suffer from three obstacles: (1) they
overlook item-level sparsity and primarily focus on session-level sparsity; (2)
they typically augment sessions using item IDs like crop, mask and reorder,
failing to ensure the semantic consistency of augmented views; (3) they treat
all positive-negative signals equally, without considering their varying
utility. To this end, we propose a novel multi-modal adaptive contrastive
learning framework called MACL for session-based recommendation. In MACL, a
multi-modal augmentation is devised to generate semantically consistent views
at both item and session levels by leveraging item multi-modal features.
Besides, we present an adaptive contrastive loss that distinguishes varying
contributions of positive-negative signals to improve self-supervised learning.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
of MACL over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 本研究表明，利用工业和开源工具进行预处理的LLMs和MLLMs在理解并回答来自PDF文档的复杂数据结构问题时，可以显著提高准确性。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex structured data in hybrid sources, such as PDF
documents and web pages, presents unique challenges for current Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in providing
accurate answers. Despite the recent advancements of MLLMs, they still often
falter when interpreting intricately structured information, such as nested
tables and multi-dimensional plots, leading to hallucinations and erroneous
outputs. This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs in
understanding and answering questions from complex data structures found in PDF
documents by leveraging industrial and open-source tools as part of a
pre-processing pipeline. Our findings indicate that GPT-4o, a popular MLLM,
achieves an accuracy of 56% on multi-structured documents when fed documents
directly, and that integrating pre-processing tools raises the accuracy of LLMs
to 61.3% for GPT-4o and 76% for GPT-4, and with lower overall cost. The code is

Conclusion: 提出的LBAW谐振器及其LOBAW具有多频率标度潜力，适合未来5G/6G射频前端模块的应用。

Abstract: In this work, Laterally excited Bulk Acoustic Wave (LBAW) resonators on X-cut
Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) and, for the first time their higher-order overtones
(LOBAW) are demonstrated by embedding interdigitated electrodes recessed into
the piezoelectric thin film, allowing to exploit both S0 and SH0 vibrational
modes. This recessed electrode architecture decouples the dispersion relation
from film thickness, enabling lithographic tuning of resonance frequency and
on-chip multi-frequency scaling on a single substrate, while concurrently
increasing static capacitance density (C0) and reducing ohmic losses (Rs). The
excited SH0 modes exhibits Figures of Merit (FoM) of 437 at 673 MHz for the
fundamental tone and 53 at 1.05 GHz for the overtone. The proposed architecture
holds large potential for future 5G/6G advanced radio frequency front-end

Abstract: The impedances of cables and lines used in (multi-conductor) distribution
networks are usually unknown or approximated, and may lead to problematic
results for any physics-based power system calculation, e.g., (optimal) power
flow. Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available
options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach
that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain
knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical
optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for
up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart
meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio
of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent
solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for
power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in
terms of accuracy and computational time.

Abstract: Ride-pooling services, such as UberPool and Lyft Shared Saver, enable a

path-planning algorithms are crucial for improving the performance of such
systems. For partially occupied vehicles with available capacity, we introduce
a novel routing algorithm designed to maximize the likelihood of picking up
additional passengers while serving the current passengers to their

based on predefined time windows, our algorithm allows for immediate responses
to passenger requests. Our approach optimizes travel time while dynamically
considering passenger demand and coordinating with other vehicles. Formulated
as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, our method is computationally
efficient and suitable for real-time applications. Simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance service quality.

Conclusion: 通过引入可证明的概率安全，确保大规模部署的残余风险低于预定义阈值，为在安全关键应用中更安全、大规模采用具身AI系统提供途径。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

TL;DR: 我们的研究证明了为什么传统的推荐系统可能会激励用户在与其互动时形成集体或采取利他策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在基于推荐系统的社交媒体平台上（例如TikTok、X、YouTube）战略性地与平台内容互动，以影响未来的推荐。在有些这样的平台上，用户已被记录形成大规模的草根运动，鼓励他人有目的地与算法抑制的内容互动，以“提升”其推荐；我们称这种行为为用户利他主义。为了捕捉这种行为，我们研究了用户和推荐系统之间的博弈。

Method: 我们研究了一个用户和推荐系统之间的博弈，其中用户向推荐系统提供（可能被操纵的）对可获取内容的偏好，而推荐系统则通过数据和处理约束创建一个低秩近似偏好矩阵，最终为每个用户提供其（近似）最偏好的项目。

Result: 我们的理论分析提供了确保在用户利他主义下用户社会福利严格增加的充分条件，并提供了一个找到有效利他策略的算法。我们展示了对于常见的推荐器效用函数，有效的利他策略也提高了推荐系统的效用！我们证明了我们的结果对几个模型错误设定具有鲁棒性，从而加强了我们的结论。

Conclusion: 我们的研究证明了为什么传统的推荐系统可能会激励用户在与其互动时形成集体或采取利他策略。

Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys)
(e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to
influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been
documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to
purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to
"boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture
this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide
the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to
them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates
a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user
her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare
under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing
user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to
ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide
an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show
that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic
strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are
robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions.
Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于Shapley值的MVP评估框架，并通过NBA和Dunk City Dynasty数据集验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community
has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player
(MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method
is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data,
which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

Result: 设计了一个预算可行机制，实现了O(log log n)的近似因子，并能在多项式时间内运行。

Conclusion: 设计了一个适用于子可加估值函数的预算可行机制，该机制在给定需求或acles的情况下，以多项式时间运行，并实现了比之前O(log n / log log n)更好的近似因子O(log log n)。

Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned
by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost
$\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of
items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq
U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer
has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the
sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are
incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of
the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a
set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le
B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the
literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and
various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor
approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular,
and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known
approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given
access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the
number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a budget-feasible
mechanism for subadditive valuations that \emph{achieves a
substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in
polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.}

Motivation: 公共物品设计中合作元素决策问题，需要考虑多方利益相关者的支持。

Method: 提出非可转让效用线性生产（NTU LP）博弈模型，并推导出核心的结构性质。

Result: 证明了NTU LP博弈核心非空的条件，开发了优化社会福利的切割平面算法，并在芝加哥公交系统服务计划优化中应用。

Conclusion: 合作对于公共物品成功部署至关重要，但可能产生不利或反直觉的分配影响。

Abstract: We consider the cooperative elements that arise in the design of public
goods, such as transportation policies and infrastructure. These involve a
variety of stakeholders: governments, businesses, advocates, and users. Their
eventual deployment depends on the decision maker's ability to garner
sufficient support from each of these groups; we formalize these strategic
requirements from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Specifically, we
introduce non-transferable utility, linear production (NTU LP) games, which
combine the game-theoretic tensions inherent in public decision-making with the
modeling flexibility of linear programming. We derive structural properties
regarding the non-emptiness, representability and complexity of the core, a
solution concept that models the viability of cooperation. In particular, we
provide fairly general sufficient conditions under which the core of an NTU LP
game is guaranteed to be non-empty, prove that determining membership in the
core is co-NP-complete, and develop a cutting plane algorithm to optimize
various social welfare objectives subject to core membership. Lastly, we apply
these results in a data-driven case study on service plan optimization for the
Chicago bus system. As our study illustrates, cooperation is necessary for the
successful deployment of transportation service plans and similar public goods,
but it may also have adverse or counterintuitive distributive implications.

Motivation: 计算第一价格拍卖中贝叶斯-纳什均衡的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过投标稀疏化和投标密集化方法来计算贝叶斯-纳什均衡。投标稀疏化是基于枚举技术，而投标密集化则利用了经济学文献中开发的连续理论。

Result: 在离散的值和投标空间中，确定纯贝叶斯-纳什均衡的存在性是NP难的。我们开发出多项式时间近似算法来计算对称设置或具有固定投标人数量的不同拍卖变体的均衡。

Conclusion: 我们展示了在离散的值和投标空间中，确定纯贝叶斯-纳什均衡的存在性是NP难的。我们还提出了两种主要方法来实现正结果，即通过投标稀疏化和投标密集化。我们使用这些方法开发出计算对称设置或具有固定投标人数量的不同拍卖变体的均衡的多项式时间近似算法。

Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of computing Bayes-Nash equilibria
in first-price auctions, where the bidders' values for the item are drawn from
a general (possibly correlated) joint distribution. We show that when the
values and the bidding space are discrete, determining the existence of a pure
Bayes-Nash equilibrium is NP-hard. This is the first hardness result in the
literature of the problem that does not rely on assumptions of subjectivity of
the priors, or convoluted tie-breaking rules. We then present two main
approaches for achieving positive results, via bid sparsification and via bid
densification. The former is more combinatorial and is based on enumeration
techniques, whereas the latter makes use of the continuous theory of the
problem developed in the economics literature. Using these approaches, we
develop polynomial-time approximation algorithms for computing equilibria in
symmetric settings or settings with a fixed number of bidders, for different
(discrete or continuous) variants of the auction.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种基于Neural ODEs的框架，用于学习PDE系统的降阶矩动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决SINDy等基于导数的方法需要密集采样数据且对噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于Neural ODEs的数据驱动框架，用于从PDE系统学习降阶矩动力学。

Result: 该框架在具有闭合的情况下，可以从有限的和不规则观察中准确恢复控制矩动力学；在无解析闭合的情况下，可以找到低维表示，使矩动力学成为闭合，便于可解释和可靠的建模。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了Neural ODE框架在复杂PDE系统学习可解释、低维矩动力学方面的强大和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Method: 以GDPR的“合法利益”法律依据为案例研究，调查从业者如何使用在线论坛来识别实践中应用合法利益的常见困惑领域，并评估在线论坛回复的法律合理性。

Result: 分析发现，应用“合法利益”法律依据对从业者来说复杂，对GDPR的实践实施有重要影响。法律分析显示，众包的法律信息通常法律上是合理的，但有时不完整。

Conclusion: 对GDPR中“合法利益”法律依据的应用进行了研究，发现应用这一法律依据对从业者来说复杂，对GDPR的实践实施有重要影响。法律分析显示，众包的法律信息通常法律上是合理的，但有时不完整。建议通过确保回复更合法和全面，以改善在线论坛的质量，使从业者能够有效地在实践中的应用合法利益并维护GDPR。

Abstract: Practitioners building online services and tools often turn to online forums
such as Reddit, Law Stack Exchange, and Stack Overflow for legal guidance to
ensure compliance with the GDPR. The legal information presented in these
forums directly impact present-day industry practitioner's decisions. Online
forums can serve as gateways that, depending on the accuracy and quality of the
answers provided, may either support or undermine the protection of privacy and
data protection fundamental rights. However, there is a need for deeper
investigation into practitioners' decision-making processes and their
understanding of legal compliance.
  Using GDPR's ``legitimate interests'' legal ground for processing personal
data as a case study, we investigate how practitioners use online forums to
identify common areas of confusion in applying legitimate interests in
practice, and evaluate how legally sound online forum responses are. Our
analysis found that applying the ``legitimate interests'' legal basis is
complex for practitioners, with important implications for how the GDPR is
implemented in practice. The legal analysis showed that crowdsourced legal
information tends to be legally sound, though sometimes incomplete. We outline
recommendations to improve the quality of online forums by ensuring that
responses are more legally sound and comprehensive, enabling practitioners to
apply legitimate interests effectively in practice and uphold the GDPR.

Motivation: 为了实现负责任的人工智能，培养工作场所的透明度、多样性和包容性文化可以孕育创新、信任和员工满意度。在人工智能和机器学习（ML）中，这样的环境与负责任的发展标准更高相关。没有透明度，差异、微攻击和不端行为将无法解决，这将损害负责任的人工智能旨在缓解的结构不平等。

Abstract: In efforts toward achieving responsible artificial intelligence (AI),
fostering a culture of workplace transparency, diversity, and inclusion can
breed innovation, trust, and employee contentment. In AI and Machine Learning
(ML), such environments correlate with higher standards of responsible
development. Without transparency, disparities, microaggressions and misconduct
will remain unaddressed, undermining the very structural inequities responsible
AI aims to mitigate. While prior work investigates workplace transparency and
disparities in broad domains (e.g. science and technology, law) for specific
demographic subgroups, it lacks in-depth and intersectional conclusions and a
focus on the AI/ML community. To address this, we conducted a pilot survey of
1260 AI/ML professionals both in industry and academia across different axes,
probing aspects such as belonging, performance, workplace Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, accessibility, performance and compensation,
microaggressions, misconduct, growth, and well-being. Results indicate enduring
disparities in workplace experiences for underrepresented and/or marginalized
subgroups. In particular, we highlight that accessibility remains an important
challenge for a positive work environment and that disabled employees have a
worse workplace experience than their non-disabled colleagues. We further
surface disparities for intersectional groups and discuss how the
implementation of DEI initiatives may differ from their perceived impact on the
workplace. This study is a first step towards increasing transparency and
informing AI/ML practitioners and organizations with empirical results. We aim
to foster equitable decision-making in the design and evaluation of
organizational policies and provide data that may empower professionals to make
more informed choices of prospective workplaces.

Motivation: 为了解决LLMs可能存在的方言偏见问题，并确保聊天机器人的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 我们提出了一种评估基于LLM的聊天机器人方言偏见的框架，该框架通过测量它们产生服务质量危害的程度来评估方言偏见。

Result: 我们的框架能够识别出Rufus对边缘化英语方言的提示产生低质量的响应，并发现这些服务质量危害因提示中的错误而加剧。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种评估基于LLM的聊天机器人方言偏见的框架，并通过案例研究证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Increasingly, individuals who engage in online activities are expected to
interact with large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Prior work has shown
that LLMs can display dialect bias, which occurs when they produce harmful
responses when prompted with text written in minoritized dialects. However,
whether and how this bias propagates to systems built on top of LLMs, such as
chatbots, is still unclear. We conduct a review of existing approaches for
auditing LLMs for dialect bias and show that they cannot be straightforwardly
adapted to audit LLM-based chatbots due to issues of substantive and ecological
validity. To address this, we present a framework for auditing LLM-based
chatbots for dialect bias by measuring the extent to which they produce
quality-of-service harms, which occur when systems do not work equally well for
different people. Our framework has three key characteristics that make it
useful in practice. First, by leveraging dynamically generated instead of
pre-existing text, our framework enables testing over any dialect, facilitates
multi-turn conversations, and represents how users are likely to interact with
chatbots in the real world. Second, by measuring quality-of-service harms, our
framework aligns audit results with the real-world outcomes of chatbot use.
Third, our framework requires only query access to an LLM-based chatbot,
meaning that it can be leveraged equally effectively by internal auditors,
external auditors, and even individual users in order to promote
accountability. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we conduct a case
study audit of Amazon Rufus, a widely-used LLM-based chatbot in the customer
service domain. Our results reveal that Rufus produces lower-quality responses
to prompts written in minoritized English dialects, and that these
quality-of-service harms are exacerbated by the presence of typos in prompts.

Result: 发现代理监管加剧了三个现有治理挑战：持续监管、治理和运营能力的深度融合以及部门间协调。

Conclusion: 研究发现，引入代理型AI系统加剧了传统公共部门监管机制面临的挑战，并提出五个治理维度以确保负责任的代理部署。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Conclusion: 研究者发现，现有的测量工具往往不能满足实际工作者的需求，存在测量不充分或工具使用障碍的问题。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

Result: 研究发现，结合大学学位和AI-900认证的计算机科学专业学位在机器学习工程师职位中获得了最高的技能相似度得分。非技术学位（如护理）结合AI认证后，与机器学习工程师职位的匹配度提高了9296%。

Conclusion: 研究发现，结合大学学位和有针对性的行业认证可以显著提高技术角色的就业能力。

Abstract: Australia faces a critical technology skills shortage, requiring
approximately $52,000$ new technology professionals annually by 2030, while
confronting a widening gap between employer requirements and graduate
capabilities. With only $1\%$ of technology graduates considered immediately
work-ready, traditional educational pathways alone prove insufficient to meet
industry demands. This research examines how industry certifications, such as
Microsoft's AI-900 (Azure AI Fundamentals), can bridge this critical skills
gap. We propose a novel, data-driven methodology that quantitatively measures
skill alignment between educational offerings and job market requirements by
analysing over 2.5 million job advertisements from Australia, the US, and the
UK, mapping extracted skills to industry taxonomies using the Vectorised Skills
Space Method. Our findings reveal that combining university degrees with
targeted industry certifications significantly enhances employability for
technology roles. The Bachelor of Computer Science with AI major combined with
AI-900 certification achieved the highest absolute skill similarity score for
Machine Learning Engineer positions. Surprisingly, the largest improvements
when augmented with AI certifications are experiences by non-technical
degrees--such as nursing nursing--with up to $9,296\%$ percentage improvements
in alignment with Machine Learning Engineer roles. Our results challenge
conventional assumptions about technology career pathways. They can provide
actionable insights for educational institutions seeking evidence-based
curriculum design, students requiring strategic certification guidance, and
employers recognising potential in candidates from non-traditional backgrounds
who have obtained relevant certifications.

Motivation: 由于涉及的研究人员和社区的异质性，目标是确定EdTec研究背景下管理的研究数据类别。

Method: 通过分析作者在EasyChair提供的观点，比较了作者是否分享了研究数据的信息，与对提交的文章及其包含的研究数据的分析。此外，还分析了2024年DELFI会议的论文集，以了解哪些数据被用于研究以及在哪里发表。

Result: 发现并非所有研究数据都被作者识别为研究数据，特别是软件和定性数据。

Conclusion: 研究发现，并非所有研究数据都被作者识别为研究数据，特别是软件和定性数据，这表明普遍缺乏意识和其他潜在障碍。此外，这项工作对培训未来一代EdTec研究人员具有重要意义，并强调了需要指南和认可研究数据出版物（尤其是软件和定性数据）的必要性。

Abstract: Educational Technology (EdTec) research is conducted by multiple disciplines,
some of which annually meet at the DELFI conference. Due to the heterogeneity
of involved researchers and communities, it is our goal to identify categories
of research data overseen in the context of EdTec research. Therefore, we
analyze the author's perspective provided via EasyChair where authors specified
whether they had research data to share. We compared this information with an
analysis of the submitted articles and the contained research data. We found
that not all research data was recognized as such by the authors, especially
software and qualitative data, indicating a prevailing lack of awareness, and
other potential barriers. In addition, we analyze the 2024 DELFI proceedings to
learn what kind of data was subject to research, and where it is published.
This work has implications for training future generations of EdTec
researchers. It further stresses the need for guidelines and recognition of
research data publications (particularly software, and qualitative data).

Conclusion: 研究表明，为大型语言模型（LLM）分配特定角色会导致有害内容生成增加。论文揭示了拒绝率中的性别偏见，并发现某些负面角色可以使对中国社会群体的毒性增加60倍。论文提出了一种多模型反馈策略，以减少毒性输出。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted that assigning specific personas to large
language models (LLMs) can significantly increase harmful content generation.
Yet, limited attention has been given to persona-driven toxicity in non-Western
contexts, particularly in Chinese-based LLMs. In this paper, we perform a
large-scale, systematic analysis of how persona assignment influences refusal
behavior and response toxicity in Qwen, a widely-used Chinese language model.
Utilizing fine-tuned BERT classifiers and regression analysis, our study
reveals significant gender biases in refusal rates and demonstrates that
certain negative personas can amplify toxicity toward Chinese social groups by
up to 60-fold compared to the default model. To mitigate this toxicity, we
propose an innovative multi-model feedback strategy, employing iterative
interactions between Qwen and an external evaluator, which effectively reduces
toxic outputs without costly model retraining. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of culturally specific analyses for LLMs safety and offer a practical
framework for evaluating and enhancing ethical alignment in LLM-generated
content.

### [493] [A Framework for Ethical Judgment of Smart City Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05172)
*Weichen Shi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出并验证了智能城市伦理判断框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市采用物联网技术，需要有效管理智能城市实践并预防不道德的结果。

Method: 采用多智能体方法和基于逻辑的伦理规则来识别潜在违规行为。

Result: 开发了一套13个伦理原则和规则，以指导智能城市的伦理实践。

Conclusion: 提出一个判断框架，用于分析智能城市应用中的伦理问题，并通过模拟证明其有效性。

Abstract: As modern cities increasingly adopt a variety of sensors and Internet of
Things (IoT) technologies to collect and analyze data about residents,
environments, and public services, they are fostering greater interactions
among smart city applications, residents, governments, and businesses. This
trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to
manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To
facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces
a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may
arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse
social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential
violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical
principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized
two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to
model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more
efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks,
particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a
real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment
framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for
practical use.

TL;DR: 我们引入了定量语言自动机，用于定义从语言生成器到值的函数，并研究了其相关性质和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定量语言自动机旨在解决超属性的泛化问题，并为语言生成器提供一种量化评估方法。

Method: 我们引入了定量语言自动机（QLA），它由定量词自动机（QWA）和聚合函数组成。QWA定义了从无限词到值的函数，而QLA定义了从语言生成器到值的函数。

Result: 我们给出了定量超属性的几个例子，并研究了QLA的评估、非空性和通用性三个典型问题。

Conclusion: 我们引入了定量语言自动机（QLA），它将函数从语言生成器映射到值。QLA由QWA和聚合函数组成，用于定义超属性的泛化，称为定量超属性。我们研究了QLA的三个典型问题：评估、非空性和通用性，并提供了这些问题的可决性图景。

Abstract: A quantitative word automaton (QWA) defines a function from infinite words to
values. For example, every infinite run of a limit-average QWA A obtains a mean
payoff, and every word w is assigned the maximal mean payoff obtained by
nondeterministic runs of A over w. We introduce quantitative language automata
(QLAs) that define functions from language generators (i.e., implementations)
to values, where a language generator can be nonprobabilistic, defining a set
of infinite words, or probabilistic, defining a probability measure over
infinite words. A QLA consists of a QWA and an aggregator function. For
example, given a QWA A, the infimum aggregator maps each language L to the
greatest lower bound assigned by A to any word in L. For boolean value sets,
QWAs define boolean properties of traces, and QLAs define boolean properties of
sets of traces, i.e., hyperproperties. For more general value sets, QLAs serve
as a specification language for a generalization of hyperproperties, called
quantitative hyperproperties. A nonprobabilistic (resp. probabilistic)
quantitative hyperproperty assigns a value to each set (resp. distribution) G
of traces, e.g., the minimal (resp. expected) average response time exhibited
by the traces in G. We give several examples of quantitative hyperproperties
and investigate three paradigmatic problems for QLAs: evaluation, nonemptiness,
and universality. In the evaluation problem, given a QLA AA and an
implementation G, we ask for the value that AA assigns to G. In the
nonemptiness (resp. universality) problem, given a QLA AA and a value k, we ask
whether AA assigns at least k to some (resp. every) language. We provide a
comprehensive picture of decidability for these problems for QLAs with common
aggregators as well as their restrictions to omega-regular languages and trace
distributions generated by finite-state Markov chains.

Motivation: 随着软件系统复杂性的增加，解释其行为的方法变得越来越重要。当系统失败时，确定哪些组件负责这个失败至关重要。

Method: 本文使用图游戏和Shapley值来分配责任值，提出了一种新的细化算法，该算法迭代地计算责任。

Result: 本文为向后责任提供了关于可达性、Büchi和奇偶性目标的紧致复杂度界限。

Conclusion: 本文为向后责任提供了关于可达性、Büchi和奇偶性目标的紧致复杂度界限。对于Büchi目标，提供了一个多项式算法来确定责任状态集合。为了分析对于标准方法来说太大的系统，本文提出了一种新的细化算法，该算法迭代地计算责任，并通过一个典型实现展示了其效用。

Abstract: As the complexity of software systems rises, methods for explaining their
behaviour are becoming ever-more important. When a system fails, it is critical
to determine which of its components are responsible for this failure. Within
the verification community, one approach uses graph games and the Shapley value
to ascribe a responsibility value to every state of a transition system. As
this is done with respect to a specific failure, it is called backward
responsibility.
  This paper provides tight complexity bounds for backward responsibility for
reachability, B\"uchi and parity objectives. For B\"uchi objectives, a
polynomial algorithm is given to determine the set of responsible states. To
analyse systems that are too large for standard methods, the paper presents a
novel refinement algorithm that iteratively computes responsibility and
demonstrates its utility with a prototypical implementation.

*Xiaodan Shao,Qijun Jiang,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Naofal Al-Dhahir*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型P-6DMA天线，显著提高了无线通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升无线通信性能，有效地利用极化和空间多样性。

Method: 建立了P-6DMA信道模型，并提出了一种新的双时间尺度传输协议。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与未采用极化或天线旋转的基准相比，P-6DMA在性能上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新型极化六维可移动天线（P-6DMA），通过电控极化和机械控制旋转，有效地提高了无线通信性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarized six-dimensional movable antenna
(P-6DMA) to enhance the performance of wireless communication cost-effectively.
Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the
antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation
mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to
reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First,
we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming
vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission
protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser
system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first
optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all
users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI.
Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the
instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the
polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and
rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity
algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming
coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation
results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming,
antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks
without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: None

Method: None

Result: None

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Sparse phase retrieval with redundant dictionary is to reconstruct the
signals of interest that are (nearly) sparse in a redundant dictionary or frame
from the phaseless measurements via the optimization models. Gao [7] presented
conditions on the measurement matrix, called null space property (NSP) and
strong dictionary restricted isometry property (S-DRIP), for exact and stable
recovery of dictionary-$k$-sparse signals via the $\ell_1$-analysis model for
sparse phase retrieval with redundant dictionary, respectively, where, in
particularly, the S-DRIP of order $tk$ with $t>1$ was derived. In this paper,
motivated by many advantages of the $\ell_q$ minimization with $0<q\leq1$,
e.g., reduction of the number of measurements required, we generalize these two
conditions to the $\ell_q$-analysis model. Specifically, we first present two
NSP variants for exact recovery of dictionary-$k$-sparse signals via the
$\ell_q$-analysis model in the noiseless scenario. Moreover, we investigate the
S-DRIP of order $tk$ with $0<t<\frac{4}{3}$ for stable recovery of
dictionary-$k$-sparse signals via the $\ell_q$-analysis model in the noisy
scenario, which will complement the existing result of the S-DRIP of order $tk$
with $t\geq2$ obtained in [4].

TL;DR: 本文分析并改进了基于Capetanakis树的随机访问协议，以提高数据新鲜度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估物联网应用中的数据新鲜度，研究者们提出了信息年龄（AoI）这一关键指标。在基于ALOHA变体的随机访问协议中，碰撞解决算法对于可靠地传输数据包起着至关重要的作用。

Method: 本文首次对经典Capetanakis树算法在受外部干扰情况下的平均AoI进行了分析性描述，并探讨了具有早期终止功能的变体。这种变体在达到最大槽位数量后即使没有解决所有用户也会截断竞争，从而在可靠性和及时性之间引入了基本权衡，允许丢弃陈旧数据包以提高新鲜度。

Result: 对Capetanakis树算法的平均AoI进行了分析，并提出了一个具有早期终止功能的变体，以在可靠性和及时性之间进行权衡。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为提高物联网应用中数据的新鲜度和可靠性提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a key metric for assessing data
freshness in IoT applications, where a large number of devices report
time-stamped updates to a monitor. Such systems often rely on random access
protocols based on variations of ALOHA at the link layer, where collision
resolution algorithms play a fundamental role to enable reliable delivery of
packets. In this context, we provide the first analytical characterization of
average AoI for the classical Capetanakis tree-based algorithm with gated
access under exogenous traffic, capturing the protocol's dynamics, driven by
sporadic packet generation and variable collision resolution times. We also
explore a variant with early termination, where contention is truncated after a
maximum number of slots even if not all users are resolved. The approach
introduces a fundamental trade-off between reliability and timeliness, allowing
stale packets to be dropped to improve freshness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑空间相关性的时空信息新鲜度模型，以解决环境监测中通信范围选择不准确和能源效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境监测中空间相关性的建模复杂度高，导致近期文献中对此关注不足。

Method: 提出了一种时空信息新鲜度模型，考虑远程监控场景中系统状态的条件熵。

Result: 分析结果表明，仅以年龄为导向的方案倾向于选择过宽的通信范围，导致估计不准确和能源效率低下，这些问题可以通过采用时空方法来缓解。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: The widespread adoption of age of information (AoI) as a meaningful and
analytically tractable information freshness metric has led to a wide body of
work on the timing performance of Internet of things (IoT) systems. However,
the spatial correlation inherent to environmental monitoring has been mostly
neglected in the recent literature, due to the significant modeling complexity
it introduces. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a model of
spatio-temporal information freshness, considering the conditional entropy of
the system state in a remote monitoring scenario, such as a low-orbit satellite
collecting information from a wide geographical area. Our analytical results
show that purely age-oriented schemes tend to select an overly broad
communication range, leading to inaccurate estimates and energy inefficiency,
both of which can be mitigated by adopting a spatio-temporal approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组件码在初始迭代中表现不佳，引入错误，限制了TPC的性能。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的神经网络识别可能导致错误的更新，并触发回滚机制以防止更新，保持组件码消息完整。

Result: 该方法在具有四个完整迭代的TPC方案中，将Chase p=6解码的比特错误率性能提高了约0.145 dB，优于传统的Chase p=7解码。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于神经网络的回滚Chase-Pyndiah解码方法，以解决组件码引入错误的问题，提高了解码性能。

Abstract: Iterative decoding is essential in modern communication systems, especially
optical communications, where error-correcting codes such as turbo product
codes (TPC) and staircase codes are widely employed. A key factor in achieving
high error correction performance is the use of soft-decision decoding for
component codes. However, implementing optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP)
probability decoding for commonly used component codes, such as BCH and Polar
codes, is computationally prohibitive. Instead, practical systems rely on
approximations, with the Chase-Pyndiah algorithm being a widely used suboptimal
method. TPC are more powerful than their component codes and begin to function
effectively at low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, during the initial
iterations, the component codes do not perform well and introduce errors in the
extrinsic information updates. This phenomenon limits the performance of TPC.
This paper proposes a neural network-aided rollback Chase-Pyndiah decoding
method to address this issue. A transformer-based neural network identifies
cases where extrinsic updates are likely to introduce errors, triggering a
rollback mechanism which prevents the update and keeps the component code
message intact. Our results demonstrate that a neural network with a relatively
small number of parameters can effectively distinguish destructive updates and
improve decoding performance. We evaluate the proposed approach using TPC with
(256, 239) extended BCH component codes. We show that the proposed method
enhances the bit error rate performance of Chase-Pyndiah p=6 decoding,
achieving a gain of approximately 0.145 dB in a TPC scheme with four full
iterations, significantly outperforming conventional Chase p=7 decoding.

Conclusion: 提出了一种适用于目标导向语义网络的资源分配框架，该框架通过主观感知评估系统质量，并考虑了累积前景理论（CPT）偏好。

Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic
networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective
(e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts
for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory
(EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences.
We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric
aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk
perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics.
By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation
design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the
framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power
allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.

Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication
with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here.
By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior
using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive
utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting
subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the
aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a
nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this
challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines
successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and
Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while
preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical
effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.

Motivation: 为了解决基于CSI的定位（POS）和信道绘制（CC）中的问题，我们受Word2Vec技术的启发，提出了一种名为CSI2Vec的自监督框架，用于生成通用的、鲁棒的信道状态信息（CSI）表示。

Method: CSI2Vec通过学习各种无线场景下的紧凑向量嵌入来捕获用户设备位置之间的空间关系，而无需依赖于CSI重建或真实位置信息。该框架被实现为一个神经网络，在多种部署设置（即无线电设备的空间排列和散射体）和无线电设置（即特定硬件）中进行训练，确保对环境、使用的天线数量或分配的子载波集合等方面的鲁棒性。

Result: CSI2Vec通过生成紧凑的向量嵌入来抽象无线设置，捕获基本的空间信息，避免了需要完整CSI传输或重建，同时降低了下游任务的复杂性和提高了处理效率。仿真结果表明，CSI2Vec在保持优异的POS和CC性能的同时，降低了计算需求和存储。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec, have demonstrated
exceptional capabilities in capturing semantic and syntactic relationships of
text through vector embeddings. Inspired by this technique, we propose CSI2Vec,
a self-supervised framework for generating universal and robust channel state
information (CSI) representations tailored to CSI-based positioning (POS) and
channel charting (CC). CSI2Vec learns compact vector embeddings across various
wireless scenarios, capturing spatial relationships between user equipment
positions without relying on CSI reconstruction or ground-truth position
information. We implement CSI2Vec as a neural network that is trained across
various deployment setups (i.e., the spatial arrangement of radio equipment and
scatterers) and radio setups (RSs) (i.e., the specific hardware used), ensuring
robustness to aspects such as differences in the environment, the number of
used antennas, or allocated set of subcarriers. CSI2Vec abstracts the RS by
generating compact vector embeddings that capture essential spatial
information, avoiding the need for full CSI transmission or reconstruction
while also reducing complexity and improving processing efficiency of
downstream tasks. Simulations with ray-tracing and real-world CSI datasets
demonstrate CSI2Vec's effectiveness in maintaining excellent POS and CC
performance while reducing computational demands and storage.

Conclusion: 提出了一种使用神经网络离散化特征函数的方法来寻找特征值和特征函数，这种方法特别简单且稳健，可用于处理连续特征值问题。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study high-order exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta
(ETD-RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for nonlinear degenerate parabolic
equations. This class of equations exhibits hyperbolic behavior in degenerate
regions and parabolic behavior in non-degenerate regions, resulting in sharp
wave fronts in the solution profiles and a parabolic-type time-step
restriction, $\tau \sim O(h^2)$, for explicit time integration. To address
these challenges and solve such equations in complex domains, we employ DG
methods with appropriate stabilizing limiters on unstructured meshes to capture
the wave fronts and use ETD-RK methods for time integration to resolve the
stiffness of parabolic terms. We extract the system's stiffness using the
Jacobian matrix of the DG discretization for diffusion terms and adopt a nodal
formulation to facilitate its computation. The algorithm is described in detail
for two-dimensional triangular meshes. We also conduct a linear stability
analysis in one spatial dimension and present computational results on
three-dimensional simplex meshes, demonstrating significant improvements in
stability and large time-step sizes.

Method: 采用Runge--Kutta方法对非定常不可压缩Navier--Stokes方程进行数值时间积分。使用有限元素法对得到的非线性微分方程系统进行离散化。在每个时间步长，通过牛顿法计算每个阶段的数值近似，这需要在每个非线性迭代中求解一个大型稀疏广义鞍点问题。我们设计了一种增强的拉格朗日预条件器，在灵活的GMRES方法中用于求解牛顿系统。预条件器可以通过多网格程序以不精确的方式应用。

Result: 提出了一种基于Runge--Kutta方法和有限元素法的数值时间积分方法，并设计了增强的拉格朗日预条件器，以提高计算效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: We consider a Runge--Kutta method for the numerical time integration of the
nonstationary incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. This yields a sequence
of nonlinear problems to be solved for the stages of the Runge--Kutta method.
The resulting nonlinear system of differential equations is discretized using a
finite element method. To compute a numerical approximation of the stages at
each time step, we employ Newton's method, which requires the solution of a
large and sparse generalized saddle-point problem at each nonlinear iteration.
We devise an augmented Lagrangian preconditioner within the flexible GMRES
method for solving the Newton systems at each time step. The preconditioner can
be applied inexactly with the help of a multigrid routine. We present numerical
evidence of the robustness and efficiency of the proposed strategy for
different values of the viscosity, mesh size, time step, and number of stages
of the Runge--Kutta method.

Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by
finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the
RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in
an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz
structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that
effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method,
applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all
non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct
electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The
derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house
inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector
calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32
array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This
approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.

Conclusion: T${^2}$S${^2}$求解器为复杂传输现象的建模提供了新的高效且精确的方法。

Abstract: Transport phenomena-describing the movement of particles, energy, or other
physical quantities-are fundamental in various scientific disciplines,
including nuclear physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, engineering, and the
natural sciences.
  However, solving the associated seven-dimensional transport equations poses a
significant computational challenge due to the curse of dimensionality.
  We introduce the Tensor Train Superconsistent Spectral (T${^2}$S${^2}$)
solver to address this challenge, integrating Spectral Collocation for
exponential convergence, Superconsistency for stabilization in
transport-dominated regimes, and Tensor Train format for substantial data
compression. T${^2}$S${^2}$ enforces a dimension-wise superconsistent condition
compatible with tensor structures, achieving extremely low compression ratios,
in the order of $(10^{-12})$, while preserving spectral accuracy. Numerical
experiments on linear problems demonstrate that T${^2}$S${^2}$ can solve
high-dimensional transport problems in minutes on standard hardware, making
previously intractable problems computationally feasible. This advancement
opens new avenues for efficiently and accurately modeling complex transport
phenomena.

Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the
user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for
tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation.
To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive
works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions
with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature
(e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to
construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second,
grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method
(e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact,
etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each
method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to
rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different
available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the
process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each
tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection
of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g.
rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the
multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in
MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in
order to provide readers a digest of this contributive work and some details
with simple examples.

demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a
speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule
employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points

Abstract: Randomized numerical linear algebra is proved to bridge theoretical
advancements to offer scalable solutions for approximating tensor

fixed Tucker-rank problem of Tucker decomposition, through the integration of
adaptive shifted power iterations. The proposed algorithms enhance randomized
variants of truncated high-order singular value decomposition (T-HOSVD) and
sequentially T-HOSVD (ST-HOSVD) by incorporating dynamic shift strategies,
which accelerate convergence by refining the singular value gap and reduce the
number of required power iterations while maintaining accuracy. Theoretical
analyses provide probabilistic error bounds, demonstrating that the proposed
methods achieve comparable or superior accuracy compared to deterministic
approaches. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate
the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms, showing a significant
decline in runtime and approximation error over state-of-the-art techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决理想磁流体动力学方程求解中的散度自由约束问题，并提高求解的精度和稳定性。

Method: 提出了一种新的PP AF方案，使用Godunov-Powell源项处理散度自由约束，并在每个单元中构建非守恒源项，同时采用局部Lax-Friedrichs（LLF）通量矢量分裂和中心差分离散化源项中的散度。

Result: 验证了PP AF方案的高阶精度、正定性属性和激波捕捉能力，并验证了Godunov-Powell源项及其合适离散化在控制散度误差中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 提出了一种保持正定性（PP）的Active Flux（AF）方案，用于求解理想磁流体动力学方程，并验证了其高阶精度、正定性属性和激波捕捉能力。

Abstract: The Active Flux (AF) is a compact, high-order finite volume scheme that
allows more flexibility by introducing additional point value degrees of
freedom at cell interfaces. This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF
scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell
source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the
evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite
volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built
on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact
stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs
(LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally
proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific
Computing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to
discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a
scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity
by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source
term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence
error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the
cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order
accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role
of the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in
controlling divergence error is also validated.

Conclusion: 介绍了用于向列液晶的三维Landau-de Gennes $Q$-张量能量的有限元近似框架，严格证明了离散线性问题的适定性，并推导了离散解的存在性和局部唯一性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive finite element approximation framework
for three-dimensional Landau-de Gennes $Q$-tensor energies for nematic liquid
crystals, with a particular focus on the anisotropy of the elastic energy and
the Ball-Majumdar singular potential. This potential imposes essential physical
constraints on the eigenvalues of the $Q$-tensor, ensuring realistic modeling.
We address the approximation of regular solutions to nonlinear elliptic partial
differential equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions associated with
Landau-de Gennes energies. The well-posedness of the discrete linearized
problem is rigorously demonstrated. The existence and local uniqueness of the
discrete solution is derived using the Newton-Kantorovich theorem. Furthermore,
we demonstrate an optimal order convergence rate in the energy norm and discuss
the impact of eigenvalue constraints on the a priori error analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法通过最大化所有物理允许的绳索形状的碰撞概率，解决了长绳索系统的碰撞概率估计问题，从而提高了对危险和良性遭遇的区分能力，支持更明智的碰撞避免决策。

Abstract: This Engineering Note addresses the challenge of estimating the probability
of collision for tethered spacecraft during close encounters with other space
objects. Standard probability of collision methods, based on spherical
hard-body assumptions, tend to be overly conservative when applied to long
tether systems. We introduce a method that accounts for the tether's spatial
extent and configuration uncertainty by maximizing the probability of collision
over all physically admissible tether shapes. Applied to real-world conjunction
events involving a kilometer-scale flexible inextensible tether, the method
yields more realistic risk estimates. This approach improves the ability to
distinguish hazardous from benign encounters, thereby supporting more informed
collision avoidance decisions.

Abstract: This paper develops the sketching (i.e., randomized dimension reduction)

Motivation: MLLM在检测OOC虚假信息方面存在挑战，例如难以捕捉深层关系和证据中的噪声。

Method: 我们提出了CMIE，一个结合共存关系生成策略和关联评分机制的OOC虚假信息检测框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在检测虚假信息方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: 通过将量化的布尔公式（QBF）扩展到包含通用整数变量和线性约束，同时通过变量量化来泛化整数规划，将多个领域连接起来。

Method: 引入了一种基于扩展的方法，使用反例引导抽象细化（CEGAR），并从QBF中借鉴技术。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种方法在特定实例中优于现有的基于搜索的QIP求解器，并且使用线性约束建模问题的能力使性能超过最先进的基于扩展的QBF求解器。

Conclusion: 扩展了QIP框架，提高了QIP求解器的性能，并展示了线性约束建模问题的优势。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

Conclusion: 研究有助于解释篮球队伍如何适应时间压力，为其他面临类似约束的团队提供启示，并构建了多层次的团队适应动态理解框架。

Abstract: In this study, basketball teams are conceptualized as complex adaptive
systems to examine their (re)organizational processes in response the time
remaining to shoot. Using temporal passing networks to model team behavior, the
focus is on the dynamics of the temporal patterns of interaction between
players. Several metrics grounded in social network analysis are calculated at
different level to assess the dynamics of the patterns used by teams and of the
individual roles within those patterns. The results reveal a 3-phase dynamic,
differentiated by more or less complex and diversified patterns, and by more or
less specialized or flexible roles. Additionally, time-dependent features of
the different tactical playing positions are identified, some of which linked
to team performance. The findings are intended to explain how basketball teams
adapt their organization to cope with time pressure, offering potential
insights for other type of teams facing similar constraints. Moreover, this
work provides a useful framework for a multilevel understanding of how
constraints shape team adaptations dynamically, making it applicable to a wide
range of team settings.

novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于分布编码的GP回归方法，在分类、多任务学习和辅助信息整合等方面进行了扩展，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的预测性能。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种处理随机向量的非线性加性噪声模型，并展示了其在因果图学习中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决包括神经科学、心理学、社会科学和工业制造等重要领域中的因果单元是变量组而不是单个标量测量的情况，我们扩展了非线性加性噪声模型以处理随机向量。

Method: 我们提出了一种两步法进行因果图学习：首先，推断随机向量之间的因果顺序；其次，进行模型选择以识别与这种顺序一致的最好图。在向量情况下，我们为这两个步骤都引入了有效且新颖的解决方案。

Result: 在模拟中展示了强大的性能，并将我们的方法应用于具有变量组因果顺序部分知识的真实世界装配线数据。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种处理随机向量的非线性加性噪声模型，并展示了其在因果图学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems

Result: 证明了简单的自适应设计在统计效率方面的优势，并解决了 Qin [2022] 中提出的第二个未解决问题。

Conclusion: 在最佳臂识别问题中，当存在至少三个处理臂时，简单的自适应设计总是严格优于非自适应的完全随机试验。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Motivation: 为了同时提高隐私性和训练效率，我们研究了如何在联邦学习中通过微调轻量级模块来保护用户数据的隐私。

Method: 我们通过梯度反演攻击对适配器PEFT机制进行了演示，这是一种允许攻击者使用可访问的适配器梯度来重建目标用户本地数据样本的方法。

Result: 我们展示了如何通过梯度反演攻击来重建大量微调图像，并强调了为PEFT提供隐私保护机制的需要。

Conclusion: 我们研究了用户微调数据的隐私如何被恶意设计的预训练模型和可训练适配器模块所侵犯，并通过实验证明了攻击者可以仅使用可访问的适配器梯度来重建目标用户的本地数据样本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照条件下，传统噪声假设（如高斯噪声）不成立，噪声是信号相关的，最好表示为泊松噪声。本研究旨在解决由泊松噪声导致的低光照图像退化问题。

Method: 引入了一种基于深度学习的轻量级方法，该方法将基于Retinex的分解与泊松降噪集成到一个统一的编码器-解码器网络中。模型通过结合泊松降噪损失来处理信号相关的噪声，同时增强照明并抑制噪声。网络无需先验的反射率和照明信息，学习有效的分解过程，同时确保一致的反射率和平滑的照明，不会造成任何形式的颜色失真。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低光照条件下显著提高了可见性和亮度，同时保留了图像结构和色彩一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在低光照图像增强和去噪方面表现出色，为低光照图像处理提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决2D CNN在超光谱图像超分辨率任务中的局限性，如对局部邻域的依赖、带相关性和数据稀缺。

Method: DACN采用增强卷积和多头注意力机制，并引入自定义优化损失函数，结合L2正则化和空间光谱梯度损失。

Result: DACN在两个超光谱数据集上的实验结果表明，多头注意力和通道注意力的组合优于单独使用任何注意力机制。

Conclusion: DACN在超光谱图像超分辨率任务中表现出色，优于单独使用任何注意力机制。

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Conclusion: PixCell是一个基于扩散的生成性基础模型，可以生成高质量图像，用于病理诊断和培训。

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Motivation: 准确的三维医学图像分割需要能够协调全局上下文建模与空间拓扑保持的架构。

Method: 提出了一种名为DM-SegNet的双Mamba架构，该架构集成了方向状态转换与解剖感知的分层解码。

Result: 在Synapse数据集上实现了腹部器官分割的DSC为85.44%，在BraTS2023数据集上实现了脑肿瘤分割的DSC为90.22%。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术对大语言模型（LLMs）的输出质量有重大影响，但其对真实性、安全性和有用性的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为对齐重采样（AR）的推理时采样方法，使用外部奖励模型来恢复对齐。

Result: 我们的实验揭示了两种不同的退化模式：守卫衰减和守卫放大。我们证明了AR方法在两种水印方法中均成功恢复了基线对齐，同时保持了强大的水印可检测性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的关键平衡，为在实际中负责任地部署水印LLMs提供了一种简单的推理时间解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Result: HSSBench包含超过13,000个精心设计的样本，覆盖六个关键类别。

Conclusion: HSSBench是一个专门用于评估MLLMs在HSS任务上的能力的基准，对主流MLLMs提出了重大挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Result: 该方法应用于两种流行的LLM家族，从1B到8B参数，并在MTEB和MMLU上进行评估，结果显示该方法显著提高了原始LLMs在MTEB上的表现，同时对MMLU的影响最小。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了原始LLMs在MTEB上的表现，同时对MMLU的影响最小，表明该方法可以赋予LLMs最先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原始的NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的方法来分解句子嵌入，使其具有可解释性，并揭示了句子嵌入空间内部的工作原理。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

TL;DR: 为了提高自动语音识别(ASR)系统的鲁棒性，建议在ASR训练数据中优先增加说话人数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了构建一个能够服务于世界各地的所有人的自动语音识别(ASR)系统，该系统需要对各种口音具有鲁棒性，包括未见过的口音。

Method: 本研究系统地研究了训练数据中的三个变量：说话人数量、每个说话人的音频时长和口音多样性，如何影响低资源训练模式下对未见口音的ASR鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，对于固定的ASR训练小时数，增加说话人数量（即每个说话人的贡献较少）比每个说话人的贡献小时数更有利。此外，更多的说话人能够从扩展小时数中获得性能提升。当控制说话人数量时，优先考虑具有不同口音的说话人带来的益处最小。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，在自动语音识别(ASR)训练中，应优先增加说话人数量，以提高对未见口音的鲁棒性。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

TL;DR: 人类规模的LMS在语言形式和意义之间表现出不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类规模的语言模型是否能够通过从频繁到罕见结构的泛化来获取和理解罕见构造的能力。

Method: 通过构建针对英语LET-ALONE构造的句法和语义属性的定制合成基准，测试了人类规模的转换语言模型对形式和意义的知识。

Result: 人类规模的LMS对形式敏感，但不能正确推断LET-ALONE的意义。

Conclusion: 人类规模的转换语言模型对罕见构型的形式敏感，但对意义没有正确推断，表明当前架构在语言形式和意义之间存在样本效率的不对称性。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Result: 在两个公共基准数据集上，HTC-CLIP在宏F1分数上比现有最先进模型提高了0.99-2.37%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为HTC-CLIP的层次文本分类方法，通过结合对比学习和路径引导的层次结构，提高了层次文本分类的性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在区分英语中“just”这一多义词的细微意义方面的能力。

Method: 使用由专家语言学家精心创建和标注的数据，研究LLMs对英语“just”的区分能力。

Result: LLMs在区分更广泛的类别方面表现出一定的能力，但在捕捉更细微的细微差别方面存在困难，这突显了它们对语篇粒子的理解差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解语篇粒子方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估低资源非洲语言的机器翻译质量是一个重大挑战，因为现有的度量标准在低资源环境下表现不佳。

Method: 我们创建了一个大型的人标注机器翻译评估数据集（SSA-MTE），开发了基于该数据的改进的评估指标（SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE），并使用最新的LLM对基于提示的方法进行了基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSA-COMET模型在低资源非洲语言上显著优于AfriCOMET，并与最强的LLM相当。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为低资源非洲语言的机器翻译质量评估提供了新的解决方案，并促进了相关研究。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

TL;DR: 研究发现，推理并不总是提高LLM在金融情绪分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型在零样本金融情绪分析中的有效性，并探讨推理对性能的影响。

Method: 研究使用了Financial PhraseBank数据集，并比较了三种专有LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）和两种小型模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone）在不同提示范式下的表现。

Result: 研究发现，推理并未提高性能，最准确的方法是GPT-4o，没有使用思维链提示。

Conclusion: 研究发现，推理（无论是通过提示还是模型设计）并未提高该任务的性能。最准确且与人类判断一致的模型和方法组合是GPT-4o，没有使用思维链（CoT）提示。这表明，对于金融情绪分类，快速直观的“系统1”式思维比推理模型或CoT提示模拟的“系统2”式缓慢、深思熟虑的推理更接近人类的判断。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Motivation: 为了解决基于检索增强的语言模型的自动事实核查系统在处理对抗性断言方面的挑战，我们提出了一个无训练方法。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为SUCEA的模块化框架，该框架将任务分解为三个步骤：1）断言分割和去上下文；2）迭代证据检索和断言编辑；3）证据聚合和标签预测。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的事实核查数据集上的实验表明，我们的框架在检索和蕴涵标签准确性方面都有显著提高，优于四个基于断言分解的基线。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为$Safe$的回顾性、步骤感知的正式验证框架，以解决CoT中幻觉检测困难的问题，并在多个语言模型和数学数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer中提取词嵌入，并通过句子级别的主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习进行改进。

Result: 我们的方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据词语对句子语义的影响调整了向量范数。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在句子语义任务上显著优于现有静态模型，甚至在某些数据集上与基本Sentence Transformer模型（SimCSE）相当。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C$^2$EFND在检测准确性和适应性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Method: 设计了一个四维度的政治学习框架，并构建了相应的数据集，应用可解释的表示工程技术进行多维度政治概念学习。

Result: 这些向量可以解耦政治概念混淆，检测任务验证了向量的语义意义，并在OOD设置中表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。干预实验表明，这些向量可以干预LLMs以生成具有不同政治倾向的响应。

Conclusion: 这些向量可以有效地揭示LLMs的政治倾向，并可用于检测和干预LLMs的内部机制。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Conclusion: 本研究为未来基于预训练基础的多模态集成策略的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于预定义的实体属性模式或标注数据集，导致提取结果不完整。

Method: ZOES 不需要任何模式或标注样本，通过丰富、精炼和统一机制进行实体结构提取。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES 在三个不同领域内，始终如一地提高了 LLM 提取完整实体结构的能力。

Conclusion: ZOES 通过丰富、精炼和统一机制，有效提高了 LLM 基于实体结构发现的质量。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准通常只依赖于最终答案的准确性，未能捕捉推理过程的质量和结构。

Method: 提出了FineLogic，一个细粒度的评估框架，从三个维度评估逻辑推理：整体基准准确率、逐步正确性和表示级对齐。

Result: 自然语言监督在分布外和长上下文任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，而符号推理风格促进了更结构化、更原子的推理链。

Conclusion: FineLogic框架为评估和改进LLM中的逻辑推理提供了一个更严格和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Motivation: 为解决每日发布的复杂语言任务——隐谜线索。

Method: 基于LLM的推理系统通过（i）假设答案；（ii）提出词戏解释；（iii）使用在编码推理步骤上操作的验证器系统来解决谜题。

Result: 建立了在Cryptonite数据集上的新最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该系统在解决英国《泰晤士报》和《每日电讯报》的Cryptonite数据集上取得了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Method: PUGC将UGC转换为用户查询，并从策略模型中生成响应。然后将UGC作为参考文本用于响应评分，使模型与这些隐含偏好对齐。

Result: 在Alpaca Eval 2上，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型实现了9.37%的性能提升，并达到了35.93%的长度控制胜率。

Conclusion: PUGC通过利用未标记的用户生成内容(UGC)中的隐含人类偏好，生成偏好数据，从而提高语言模型生成人类偏好响应的质量。实验结果表明，与传统方法相比，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型在Alpaca Eval 2上实现了9.37%的性能提升，并达到了35.93%的长度控制胜率。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps 是一种新的基准，可以检测 LLM 在处理嵌套叙事推理方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 在处理嵌套叙事推理方面存在根本限制，需要新的基准来检测这种限制。

Method: 通过将 ListOps 计算转换为冗长、连贯的故事，强制内部计算和状态管理。

Result: 实验表明，领先的 LLM 在处理 Verbose ListOps 时表现不佳，尽管它们能够轻松解决原始的 ListOps 方程。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps 提供了一种独特的基准，可以检测 LLM 在处理嵌套叙事推理方面的困难。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Motivation: 评估LLM在不同语言中提供有效教学支持的能力，特别是对于基于数学推理的任务。

Method: 我们提出了第一个使用LLM进行多语言导师-学生互动的大规模模拟。一个更强的模型扮演导师的角色，以提示的形式生成反馈，而一个较弱的模型模拟学生。我们探索了11种类型不同的语言、四种最先进的LLM和多种提示策略，以评估语言特定的反馈是否会导致可衡量的学习成果。

Result: 结果表明，多语言提示可以显著提高学习成果，特别是在低资源语言中，当反馈与学生的母语一致时。

Conclusion: 多语言提示可以显著提高学习成果，特别是在低资源语言中，当反馈与学生的母语一致时。这些发现为开发既有效又包容的多语言、LLM教育工具提供了实际见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的SQL查询存在语义错误，需要一种方法来检测和纠正这些错误。

Method: SQLens通过整合数据库和LLM的错误信号来识别潜在的语义错误，并指导查询修正。

Result: SQLens在两个公共基准测试中，在错误检测方面比LLM自评估方法提高了25.78%，并提高了20%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: SQLens为LLM生成的SQL查询的语义错误检测和纠正提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Motivation: LLMs展现出的语言和行为，以及它们产生自我报告的能力引发了关于内省在LLMs中应用的问题。

Method: 分析LLMs的两个自我报告实例，探讨内省在LLMs中的应用。

Result: 第一个实例不是有效的内省，第二个实例是极小程度的内省。

Conclusion: LLMs的自我报告可以被视为内省的初步体现，但需要谨慎解读。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在零样本事件检测中的局限性。

Method: DiCoRe使用Dreamer进行发散推理，Grounder进行收敛推理，并使用LLM-Judge进行验证。

Result: DiCoRe在六个数据集上优于现有方法，实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一种有效的零样本事件检测框架，在六个数据集上实现了4-7%的平均F1提升。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Method: 通过对三个最先进的LALMs应用词汇投影，跟踪属性信息如何在层和标记位置之间演变。

Result: 研究发现了LALMs在听觉属性处理方面的见解，为未来的改进铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，LALMs在识别失败时，属性信息通常会随着层深度的增加而减少，且在早期层解决属性与更高的准确率相关。此外，LALMs在预测属性时，更依赖于查询听觉输入，而不是在属性提及位置聚合必要信息。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Result: Knowledgeable-r1在参数和上下文冲突任务以及通用RAG任务中显著提高了鲁棒性和推理准确性，特别是在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1通过联合采样和定义多策略分布来探索知识能力，显著提高了RAG任务的鲁棒性和推理准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法分析如何在社会、人口统计和性别偏见中结构性地表示这些偏见。

Result: 发现与偏见相关的计算高度局部化，通常集中在少数几层。

Conclusion: 通过系统消融实验，发现与偏见相关的计算高度局部化，通常集中在少数几层。此外，这些组件在微调设置中发生变化，包括与偏见无关的设置。最后，去除这些组件不仅降低了偏见的输出，还影响了其他NLP任务，如命名实体识别和语言可接受性判断，因为这些任务与这些组件共享重要组件。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在模糊场景中表现不佳，而SLMs容易受到误导性输入的影响。

Method: SLIDE方法结合了SLMs和LLMs，通过自适应加权进行集成，并提出了DRE方法来进一步改进SLM-LLM集成。

Result: DRE方法在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，与人类判断有更强的关联。

Conclusion: DRE方法提高了SLM-LLM集成的准确性和可靠性，特别是在开放式任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue

Motivation: 为了减少RAG的开销，需要对上下文进行压缩，但现有的压缩方法没有关注过滤掉非证据信息，这限制了基于LLM的RAG的性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于证据性的RAG框架ECoRAG，通过基于证据性压缩检索到的文档，确保答案生成是否得到正确证据的支持。此外，ECoRAG还反映压缩内容是否提供足够的证据，如果不充分，则检索更多内容，直到足够。

Result: 实验表明，ECoRAG在ODQA任务上提高了LLM的性能，优于现有的压缩方法。此外，ECoRAG在成本效率方面表现良好，因为它不仅减少了延迟，而且通过仅保留生成正确答案所必需的信息，最小化了令牌使用。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过基于证据性的上下文压缩，提高了LLM在ODQA任务上的性能，并且成本效益高。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Motivation: 本研究旨在检验将翻译任务分解为多步骤提示策略的有效性，并探讨在翻译领域中思维链（CoT）有效性的因素。

Method: 本研究通过实证分析来检验将翻译任务分解为多步骤提示策略的有效性。

Result: 本研究发现，对于测试模型而言，没有明确证据表明通过显式分解翻译过程可以获得性能提升；并且我们发现，简单地提示LLM“再次翻译”比类似人类的逐步提示效果更好。

Conclusion: 本研究发现，对于测试模型而言，没有明确证据表明通过显式分解翻译过程可以获得性能提升；并且我们发现，简单地提示LLM“再次翻译”比类似人类的逐步提示效果更好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

Method: 研究线性回归任务，需要推理噪声，准确的预测基于从事实观察中推断和复制上下文噪声。

Result: 语言模型能够在这个受控设置中进行反事实推理，发现自注意力、模型深度和数据多样性在预训练中驱动Transformer的性能。

Conclusion: 发现反事实推理对于广泛类别的函数可以简化为对情境观察的转换；Transformer可以在序列数据上执行噪声推理，为反事实故事生成提供初步证据。

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频中生成AVSR数据集的方法，实验表明该方法在嘈杂环境下表现优于ASR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的语音识别系统在噪声环境下表现不佳，音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR）因其对噪声的鲁棒性而受到关注。然而，AVSR模型受限于大量数据集的缺乏，尤其是对于英语以外的语言。因此，自动数据收集成为了一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 本研究提出了一种从原始视频中生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，改进了现有技术以提高效率和可访问性。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集使AVSR模型在干净条件下与鲁棒的ASR性能相当，在嘈杂环境（如鸡尾酒会）中显著优于ASR。这种方法为将AVSR扩展到更多语言，特别是资源匮乏的语言提供了一条途径。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR到更多语言，特别是资源匮乏的语言提供了一条途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成（RAG）系统中常见的问题，即检索到的外部知识与大型语言模型（LLM）的固有、参数化知识之间的冲突。

Method: Micro-Act提出了一种具有分层动作空间的框架，自动感知上下文复杂性，并通过细粒度比较来分解每个知识源。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，Micro-Act在所有5个数据集和3种冲突类型中，与最先进的基线相比，问答准确率显著提高。

Conclusion: Micro-Act通过自适应地将知识源分解为一系列精细的比较，有效地解决了知识冲突问题，显著提高了问答任务的准确率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Conclusion: ProRefine为高效和可扩展的AI部署提供了潜力，并有助于实现高性能AI的民主化访问。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Method: 将LLM遗忘问题建模为约束优化问题，使用新的logit-margin flattening损失函数和分离的保留集约束。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法，通过约束优化问题，在遗忘和保留之间取得了平衡，同时保持了优化效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Motivation: 探讨中国城市社区级街道的商业活力，分析街道特征如何影响零售业绩和用户满意度。

Method: 提出了一种基于图像的可解释框架，利用街景图像和多模态大型语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过GPT-4感知模型分析其与空间属性的关系。

Result: 发现适度车辆存在可能增强商业可达性，但过度街道停车会降低步行性和满意度，而绿化和清洁度高的街道满意度更高，但与定价关联较弱。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了车辆活动在社区商业中的条件作用，并证明了多模态AI在感知城市诊断中的可行性。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Result: 在DCLM基准测试中，使用混合数据训练模型在22个任务上提高了1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过回收和循环利用数据，提高预训练数据规模和模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Method: 研究了四种攻击类型：Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer和Free-Rider，并展示了恶意代理如何通过巧妙地操纵提示来影响MAS操作。

Result: 研究表明，LLMs在自然语言理解、代码生成和复杂规划方面表现出色，但MAS可能容易受到恶意攻击。

Conclusion: 研究发现，精心设计的提示可以导致MAS行为和可执行指令的系统偏差，使恶意代理能够有效地误导评估系统并操纵协作代理。此外，我们的攻击可以绕过基于GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini的高级LLM监控器，突显了当前检测机制的局限性。我们的发现强调了具有强大安全协议和内容验证机制以及能够进行全面风险场景评估的MAS架构的迫切需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑推理中表现良好，但在处理词汇多样化方面存在缺陷。SCALe基准和MenTaL方法可以解决这个问题。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a gradient matching approach for many-shot ICL, achieving significant improvements over random selection and paving the way for broader application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt tasks quickly without Fine-Tuning (FT), but the selection of demonstrations remains challenging. Existing methods for many-shot ICL are limited to random selection. This paper proposes a novel gradient matching approach to address this problem.

Method: This paper introduces a gradient matching approach to select demonstrations. The method aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, aiming to achieve the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected examples. The method is applied to relatively small models like Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B.

Result: The method outperforms random selection in many-shot ICL scenarios on larger LLMs, with improvements of 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential for broader application.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Result: 大多数视觉-语言模型在MuSciClaims基准上的F1分数为0.3-0.5，最佳模型为0.77。

Conclusion: 大多数视觉-语言模型在验证科学声明方面表现不佳，存在偏见，且在定位证据、跨模态信息聚合和基本图解理解方面存在困难。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出LESS框架以纠正从无监督数据中生成的伪标签。

Method: LESS框架利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来纠正从无监督数据中生成的伪标签。伪标签文本通过LLM进行优化，并通过数据过滤策略进行增强以优化LLM知识迁移效率。

Result: LESS在普通话ASR和西班牙语到英语的AST任务上实现了显著的绝对词错误率（WER）降低3.77%，在Callhome和Fisher测试集上分别达到BLEU分数34.0和64.7。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种简单的方法来控制自动文本摘要的长度，通过提高EOS标记的预测重要性，而不会影响摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制生成的文本长度对于各种文本生成任务至关重要，包括摘要。现有方法通常需要复杂的模型修改，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 我们通过提高在交叉熵损失计算中正确预测EOS标记的重要性来控制自动文本摘要的长度。该方法对架构和解码算法无依赖，与其他推理时控制生成长度的技术正交。

Result: 我们在编码器-解码器和现代GPT风格的LLM上进行了测试，表明这种方法可以控制生成长度，通常不会影响摘要的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法可以有效地控制生成长度，同时保持摘要质量。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MISMATCHED基准，用于评估科学NLI，并展示了通过包含具有隐式科学NLI关系的句子对进行模型训练可以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的科学NLI数据集主要来自计算机科学领域，而忽略了非计算机科学领域。

Method: 使用预训练的小型语言模型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）在MISMATCHED上建立了强大的基线。

Result: MISMATCHED基准包含2,700个人标注的句子对，基线模型在MISMATCHED上的Macro F1为78.17%。

Conclusion: 提出了一个新的科学自然语言推理（NLI）评估基准MISMATCHED，涵盖了三个非计算机科学领域，并证明了通过包含具有隐式科学NLI关系的句子对进行模型训练可以提高性能。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ADAPT的轻量级方法，通过增加推理性能来提高大型语言模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们发现推理优化模型往往产生较少样化的输出，这限制了TTS的有效性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ADAPT方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为ADAPT（A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning）的轻量级方法，该方法通过具有多样性关注的数据策略应用前缀微调。

Result: 实验表明，ADAPT在数学推理任务上达到了80%的准确率，同时使用比强大基线少八倍的计算量。

Conclusion: 我们的研究发现，生成多样性在最大化TTS效果中起着至关重要的作用。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决LLM训练中未经许可文本的使用带来的知识产权侵权和伦理问题。

Method: 收集、整理并发布Common Pile v0.1，用于LLM预训练。训练了两个基于Common Pile的7B参数LLM。

Result: 发布Common Pile v0.1，并训练了两个基于该数据的LLM，其性能与未经许可文本训练的LLM相当。

Conclusion: 我们收集、整理并发布了Common Pile v0.1，一个用于LLM预训练的8TB公开许可文本集合。我们训练了两个基于Common Pile的7B参数LLM，其性能与基于未经许可文本训练的LLM相当。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

Method: 研究者使用机器学习方法来建模创新者的个人观点和人际创新机会，并基于创新者在动态语言表示的概念空间中的位置来量化主观视角和创新机会。

Result: 研究发现，创新者的主观视角可以预测他们未来关注和成功结合的想法。视角和背景的多样性在预测创造性成就方面具有重要作用。

Conclusion: 研究者通过分析数百万名科学家、发明家、作家、企业家和维基百科贡献者的数据，发现创新者的主观视角可以预测他们未来关注和成功结合的想法。视角和背景的多样性在预测创造性成就方面具有重要作用。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR是一种工具增强型LLM，通过创新方法提高工具利用能力，实现最先进的性能和错误纠正率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM在工具规划和调用以及工具反思能力方面的局限性。

Method: 提出Tool-MVR，一个工具增强型LLM，通过引入多智能体元验证（MAMV）和基于探索的反思学习（EXPLORE）来提高工具利用能力。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上超越了ToolLLM和GPT-4，减少了API调用，并在RefineToolBench上实现了更高的错误纠正率。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过两个关键创新实现了全面的系统2推理，在StableToolBench上取得了最先进的性能，超越了ToolLLM和GPT-4，同时减少了API调用，并具有强大的泛化能力。在RefineToolBench上，Tool-MVR的错误纠正率显著高于ToolLLM。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Motivation: 分析搜索增强LLM系统具有挑战性，现有数据集在规模和范围上有限，通常局限于静态、单轮、事实核查问题。

Method: 提出Search Arena，一个由众包的大规模、人类偏好数据集，包含超过24,000对多轮用户与搜索增强LLM的交互。

Result: 发现用户偏好受引用数量影响，并发现社区驱动平台更受欢迎，静态百科全书式来源并不总是适当和可靠的。

Conclusion: 用户偏好受引用数量影响，即使在引用内容不支持所声称的论点时也是如此，揭示了感知信誉和实际信誉之间的差距。此外，用户偏好因引用来源而异，表明社区驱动平台通常更受欢迎，而静态百科全书式来源并不总是适当和可靠的。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Motivation: 解决KV缓存内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加的问题。

Method: TaDA方法通过量化精度自适应和均值中心消除，实现KV缓存压缩。

Result: 实验表明，TaDA方法将KV缓存内存占用减少到原始16位基线的27%，同时保持可比的准确率。

Conclusion: TaDA方法在压缩KV缓存的同时，显著提高了准确率，并降低了内存占用。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

Motivation: 当前评估LLMs规划能力的基准主要关注静态、单轮场景，而现实世界规划问题需要不断适应变化的要求和平衡竞争性约束。

Method: 提出Flex-TravelPlanner基准，评估语言模型在动态规划场景中的灵活推理能力。

Result: 模型在单轮任务上的表现无法很好地预测其在多轮任务中调整计划的能力；约束引入的顺序显著影响性能；模型在约束优先级排序上存在困难，往往错误地优先考虑新引入的低优先级偏好，而不是现有的高优先级约束。

Conclusion: 评估LLMs在更真实、动态规划场景中的重要性，并提出改进模型性能的具体方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

Result: 揭示了LLM在规范冲突方面的脆弱性，并指出当前方法不足以缓解潜在危害。

Conclusion: 当前对LLM的归一化策略不足以防止滥用，LLM缺乏检测和理性解决规范冲突的能力，对操纵易受影响。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Motivation: 互联网已成为仇恨言论的热点，威胁社会和谐和个人福祉。虽然自动检测方法在识别显性仇恨言论方面表现良好，但它们在识别微妙形式，如隐性仇恨言论方面存在困难。

Method: 提出了一个新的隐性仇恨言论检测分类法，定义了六种编码策略，称为codetypes。介绍了两种将codetypes集成到隐性仇恨言论检测中的方法：1）直接提示大型语言模型（LLMs）根据生成的响应对句子进行分类，2）使用LLMs作为编码器，在编码过程中嵌入codetypes。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上，使用codetypes提高了隐性仇恨言论检测的准确性，验证了该方法在不同语言中的有效性。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Method: STAND是一种基于N-gram和Gumbel-Top-K采样的模型无关的推测解码方法，它通过利用推理轨迹中的冗余来加速推理过程。

Result: STAND在多个推理任务中实现了60-65%的推理延迟减少，吞吐量提高了14-28%，并且在不牺牲准确性的情况下提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: STAND在推理任务中显著提高了准确性和效率，通过减少推理延迟和吞吐量来加速语言模型推理。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LLM作为评委的评价和特定任务指标的混合方法来评估文本修订质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估科学写作中的文本修订仍然是一个挑战，因为传统的指标如ROUGE和BERTScore主要关注相似性，而不是捕捉有意义的改进。

Method: 进行了人工注释研究，评估了不同修订的质量。调查了相关的NLP领域的无参考评估指标。此外，还研究了LLM作为评委的方法，分析了其评估有和无黄金参考的修订的能力。

Result: 结果表明，LLM有效地评估了指令遵循，但在正确性方面存在困难，而特定领域的指标提供了互补的见解。

Conclusion: 发现将LLM作为评委的评价和特定任务的指标相结合的混合方法提供了对修订质量的最可靠评估。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

TL;DR: MMSU是一个用于口语理解和推理的综合基准，旨在提高语音大语言模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有语音大语言模型在自然口语中的细粒度感知和复杂推理能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出MMSU，一个针对口语理解和推理的综合基准，包含5,000个精心挑选的音频-问题-答案三元组，涵盖47个不同任务。

Result: 通过评估14个先进的语音大语言模型，发现现有模型存在大量改进空间，为未来优化提供了有意义的方向。

Conclusion: MMSU建立了口语理解全面评估的新标准，为开发更高级的人机语音交互系统提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的机器翻译校对方法，显著提高了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高机器翻译质量，减少人工校对工作量。

Method: 该方法结合了CNN和BERT，CNN用于提取语义信息，BERT用于创建丰富的上下文表示。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合卷积神经网络和BERT的混合方法，显著提高了机器翻译的校对准确率。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Conclusion: VLM在识别学生手写方面存在困难，导致LLM评分中的错误传播。LLM生成的反馈仍有一定效用，尽管在个性化和上下文相关性方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在 LRMs 中存在局限性，无法有效检测推理痕迹中的幻觉或逻辑不一致。

Method: RACE 通过提取关键推理步骤，计算推理痕迹的样本间一致性、基于熵的答案不确定性、推理与答案之间的语义对齐以及推理的内部连贯性等四个诊断信号。

Result: RACE 在不同数据集和不同 LLMs 上的实验中优于现有幻觉检测基线，提供了一种鲁棒且可推广的 LRMs 评估方案。

Conclusion: RACE 是一种针对 LRMs 的幻觉检测新框架，通过联合分析推理步骤和计算四个诊断信号来提高检测准确性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Result: 发布了MockConf数据集和InterAlign工具，并提出了评估指标和自动对齐的基线。

Conclusion: None

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

TL;DR: 研究等距机器翻译在不同语言对中的有效性，发现指令措辞和示例选择对翻译质量和长度控制有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究等距机器翻译在不同语言对（En→De、En→Fr和En→Es）中的有效性。

Method: 使用八种不同大小的开源大型语言模型（LLMs），研究了不同提示策略、不同数量的少量示例和演示选择如何影响翻译质量和长度控制。

Result: 发现指令措辞、LLMs的翻译长度、少量示例提示和多个输出的影响。

Conclusion: 研究发现，指令的措辞与提供的示例属性相匹配时，在控制输出长度方面起着至关重要的作用。LLMs倾向于仅在呈现极端示例时产生较短的翻译，而等距示例通常导致模型忽略长度约束。少量示例提示通常可以提高翻译质量，但5、10和20次设置中的进一步改进微乎其微。最后，考虑多个输出可以显著改善长度和质量的权衡，为某些语言对提供最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: UD在跨语言句法表示方面的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将UD集成到预训练语言模型中，并评估其在跨语言对抗释义识别任务上的性能。

Result: UD的集成提高了模型的准确性和F1分数，平均增益分别为3.85%和6.08%。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，将UD集成到预训练语言模型中可以显著提高其在跨语言对抗释义识别任务上的性能。UD在跨领域任务中的有效性和潜力得到了证实。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准和评估指标无法充分评估大型语言模型在真实竞争环境中的编码能力，以及推理模型的反思能力。

Method: 我们提出了ICPC-Eval，包含118个精心挑选的问题，并提供了测试案例生成方法和Refine@K评估指标。

Result: 顶级推理模型如DeepSeek-R1在执行反馈的基础上，需要多轮代码反馈才能充分发挥其推理潜力，并且这些模型在代码生成方面仍落后于顶级的人类团队。

Conclusion: 评估复杂推理能力是一个重大挑战。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语上实现了相对于最佳微调Whisper模型的32%的相对错误率降低。

Conclusion: 结合混合HMM和自监督模型的组合方法在有限训练数据下显著提高了性能。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了新的方法来改善神经机器翻译，并证明了上下文信息对翻译质量的重要性。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Result: 在多领域Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上评估，它优于单步微调。基于共识的过滤优于其他方法，在Wow上提供了高达22.3%的相对改进，在Fisher上提供了高达24.8%的改进。NER是第二好的过滤器，以更低的计算成本提供了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种增量半监督学习流程，通过整合标注数据和未标注数据，提高了特定领域ASR模型的微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Conclusion: LLMs在专家级理解过程中仍具挑战性，但与专家存在相似之处，如理解局部信息优于全局信息。LLMs可能通过有缺陷的理解过程得出正确答案。建议通过SCOP改进LLMs，关注理解过程，确保所有理解技能在训练中得到充分发展。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Conclusion: 提出的对抗训练框架显著提高了翻译基线。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025官方测试集中，该系统取得了RMSE 0.375的成绩，排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出了一种将W2V与Phi-4 MLLM结合的系统，通过评分融合策略克服了BERT和W2V的局限性，在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025官方测试集中取得了第二名的成绩。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决神经语言模型中是否存在与人类处理约束一致的偏差的问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种定量框架，允许对这些偏差的性质进行可控调查。在这个框架中，我们引入了 $m$-local entropy，这是一个从平均有损上下文惊讶中导出的信息论度量，通过量化 $m-1$ 个 preceding 符号如何有效地消除下一个符号的不确定性来捕捉语言的局部不确定性。

Result: 在实验中，我们发现具有更高 $m$-local entropy 的语言对 Transformer 和 LSTM LMs 的学习更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，神经语言模型，就像人类一样，对语言的局部统计结构非常敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言生成中作为自动评估器的准确性，以及它们是否能够准确复制人类对错误严重程度的判断。

Method: 本研究扩展了van Miltenburg等（2020）的实验框架，在单模态（仅文本）和多模态（文本+图像）环境中评估了四种错误类型：年龄、性别、服装类型和服装颜色。

Result: 人类对不同的错误类型分配不同程度的严重程度，视觉环境显著增强了颜色和类型错误的感知严重程度。大多数LLM对性别错误评分低，但对颜色错误评分过高。DeepSeek-V3在单模态和多模态条件下与人类判断的最高一致性。

Conclusion: 研究发现，人类对不同的错误类型分配不同程度的严重程度，视觉环境显著增强了颜色和类型错误的感知严重程度。大多数LLM对性别错误评分低，但对颜色错误评分过高，这与人类不同，人类认为两者都高度严重，但原因不同。这表明这些模型可能内化了影响性别判断的社会规范，但缺乏模仿人类对颜色的敏感性的感知基础，这是由不同的神经机制塑造的。只有一种评估的LLM（Doubao）能够复制人类相似的错误严重程度排名，但它无法像人类一样清楚地区分错误类型。令人惊讶的是，单模态LLM DeepSeek-V3在单模态和多模态条件下与人类判断的最高一致性，甚至超过了最先进的多模态模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and

community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs越来越多地被期望仅根据上下文中提供的任务规范执行任务，而不需要输入和输出的示例；这种能力被称为指令遵循。

Method: 我们引入了Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC)框架来评估LLMs的指令遵循能力，该框架通过语言识别任务（确定字符串是否由形式语法生成）来评估。这个任务需要从上下文中组合大量指令（语法生成），语言是合成的，因此可以根据LLMs的技能提高来增加任务的复杂性，并自动生成新实例，从而减轻数据污染。

Result: 我们对最先进的LLMs在RELIC上的评估发现，它们的准确率可以可靠地从语法的复杂性和单个示例字符串预测，并且最先进的LLMs在更复杂的语法和样本上表现出接近随机性能，这与理论预期一致。我们还发现，随着语言识别任务的复杂性增加，模型转向依赖于浅层启发式方法而不是遵循复杂指令。

Conclusion: 我们发现LLMs在更复杂的语法和样本上的准确率可以可靠地从语法的复杂性和单个示例字符串预测，并且最先进的LLMs在更复杂的语法和样本上表现出接近随机性能，这与理论预期一致。我们还使用RELIC来诊断LLMs如何尝试解决越来越困难的推理任务，发现随着语言识别任务的复杂性增加，模型转向依赖于浅层启发式方法而不是遵循复杂指令。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Conclusion: None

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.
