Project page:\n  https://zifuwan.github.io/InstructPart/", "summary": "Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language\nand vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,\nautonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of\nthese models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that\nconstitute them. Understanding these components and their associated\naffordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is\nfundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part\nsegmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the\nperformance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks\nwithin everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that\ntask-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for\nstate-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,\nwe introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement\nthrough fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to\nfacilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the\napplicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual\nreality, information retrieval, and other related fields.

Across four representative models (GPT-2,\nBERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global\npartitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find\nthat decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global\nprocessing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction.\nThrough targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations\nprimarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect\nsentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse\ncoherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a\nunified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and\ncontrolling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic\ninterpretability and emergent capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "MSPGT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578bTransformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5353\u8d8a\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSPGT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8de8\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5cf0\u503c\u5212\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2d\u95f4\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4fa7\u91cd\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "MSPGT\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild\ncognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead\nto premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require\ndrivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits,\noffer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on\nthe driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and\nappropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide\ninsight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume\ncontrol, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study\ninvestigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of\nvalence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and\nthose with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across\ndifferent road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group\ndifferences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during\nTORs for both groups.

However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high\nfidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or\nbiases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models\nthat are more \"honest\" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs,\naccurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose\nHonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis\non such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture\nrealism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components.\nFirst, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve\ncrucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple\nreference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance\nfine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the\ngeneration of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall\nclarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based\non affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared\nto conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment.\nLeveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework,\nHonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity\nand realism.

In the high-resolution stage, we propose a\nmulti-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution\ndepth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism,\nmitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo\nlabels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy.\nFurthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use\nit to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory\neffect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art\nHRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperGS\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Scaffold-GS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b33DGS\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u573a\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u7c97\u7cd9\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u573a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "SuperGS\u5728\u6b63\u5411\u548c360\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperGS\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u3002"}}

Post-training KV Cache\nquantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been\nextensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying\nexisting methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation\ndue to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods\nfail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV\nCache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization\nerror. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding\n(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for\nthe distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in\nperformance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization\n(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To\nreduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to\ngradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose\nblock-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive\ntransformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional\noverhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation\nthat leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to\napproximate the data distribution of long-context data.

Similarly, medical images in universal lesion\ndetection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing\nattributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage\ntraining images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep\nmodels. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum\nlearning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by\nreweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods\nstill confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is\nimprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there\nexists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified\nhard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch\nsampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely\nunexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We\ndiscover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during\ntraining; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)\nmethod to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS\nintroduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to\nsurpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of\nhigh-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under\nrepresented or well represented and overfitted.

Several recent studies strive to\nmitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant\nvisual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While\nmost existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our\nstudy reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of\nretained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust\ncriteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and\ntraining-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by\npruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of\npruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to\nselect and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision\nencoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the \"information migration\" by further\neliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language\nmodel (LLM). Extensive experiments show that ToDRE effectively reduces 90% of\nvisual tokens after vision encoder and adaptively prunes all visual tokens\nwithin certain LLM's decoder layers, leading to a 2.6x speed-up in total\ninference time while maintaining 95.1% of model performance and excellent\ncompatibility with efficient attention operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToDRE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee4\u724c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5197\u4f59\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "ToDRE\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3k\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53bb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cToDRE\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u540e\u51cf\u5c1190%\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9bLLM\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u526a\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u603b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f2.6\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630195.1%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ToDRE\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Inspired by the success of large\npre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an\neffective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture\ndomain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt\ninputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation\nby dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for\neach input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for\nenhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable\nissue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields\nsignificantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a\nphenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative\nlearning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft\nPrompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve\nboth the stability and generalization of prompts.

However, CNN-based methods struggle to\neffectively capture global contextual information due to the inherent\nlimitations of convolution operations.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer\narchitecture, named MSLAU-Net, which integrates the strengths of both\nparadigms. The proposed MSLAU-Net incorporates two key ideas.

Final version before journal publication", "summary": "In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid\nEuclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for\nsensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient\ninference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the\nquality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid\nselection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance\nand re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models\n(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection\ntask using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high\ninter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,\nfatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle\ndifferences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves\na mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection\n(59.30$\\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\\pm$11.39%). These\nrepresent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results\nconfirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves\nthe robustness of few-shot prompting.

While visual randomization partially addresses this problem by\naugmenting training data, it remains computationally intensive and inherently\nreactive, struggling with unseen scenarios. We propose a different approach:\ninstead of randomizing appearances, we eliminate their influence entirely by\nrethinking the sensory representation itself. Inspired by biological vision\nsystems that prioritize temporal transients (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) and\nby recent sensor advancements, we introduce event-inspired perception for\nvisually robust imitation. Our method converts standard RGB videos into a\nsparse, event-based representation that encodes temporal intensity gradients,\ndiscarding static appearance features.

While existing\napproaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and\npreserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain\nfine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited\nknowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because\nsubject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the\ntarget and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the\nrepresentation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during\nediting. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles\nKnowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE).

We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based\non matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits.

To accomplish this,\nwe progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time.\nThese depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields\nin the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and\ntemporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that\nfuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images.

Our key insight is that plausible\nfuture trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated\nfrom current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC\nmechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)\nscene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate\nthe current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and\nreconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework\nintrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories.\nExperiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2\nerror by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners.\nCrucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC\ncycle as an inductive bias for robust planning.

Among these, voice enabled models such as SpeechGPT have\ndemonstrated considerable improvements in usability, offering expressive, and\nemotionally responsive interactions that foster deeper connections in real\nworld communication scenarios. However, the use of voice introduces new\nsecurity risks, as attackers can exploit the unique characteristics of spoken\nlanguage, such as timing, pronunciation variability, and speech to text\ntranslation, to craft inputs that bypass defenses in ways not seen in\ntext-based systems. Despite substantial research on text based jailbreaks, the\nvoice modality remains largely underexplored in terms of both attack strategies\nand defense mechanisms. In this work, we present an adversarial attack\ntargeting the speech input of aligned MLLMs in a white box scenario.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel token level attack that leverages access to\nthe model's speech tokenization to generate adversarial token sequences.

To address this limitation, researchers\nintroduce open-set perception models to detect or segment arbitrary test-time\nuser-input categories. However, open-set models rely on human involvement to\nprovide predefined object categories as input during inference. More recently,\nresearchers have framed a more realistic and challenging task known as\nopen-ended perception that aims to discover unseen objects without requiring\nany category-level input from humans at inference time. Nevertheless,\nopen-ended models suffer from low performance compared to open-set models. In\nthis paper, we present VL-SAM-V2, an open-world object detection framework that\nis capable of discovering unseen objects while achieving favorable performance.\nTo achieve this, we combine queries from open-set and open-ended models and\npropose a general and specific query fusion module to allow different queries\nto interact. By adjusting queries from open-set models, we enable VL-SAM-V2 to\nbe evaluated in the open-set or open-ended mode.

Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as\npromising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities;\nhowever, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their\npractical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion\nModel (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent\nspace to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual\ninformation, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster\ninference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the\nintegration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator,\norchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further\nintroduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling\nKSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening\narchitectures.

However, despite progress\nwith pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate\ncross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit\nthe complementary nature of different modalities. To address these\nshortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that\nleverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and\nadvanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image\nfeatures into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention\nmechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.\nThis mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that\nadaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring\nthat only the most relevant information is emphasized.

While large language models\n(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity\nand contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories\nof metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind\ndecomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a\nTheory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent,\nemotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and\nethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually\nappropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging\nbenchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain\nin ToM reasoning.

Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency\nby operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat\nall steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary\nsteps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this\npaper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that\ndynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths\nin latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of\ndynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the\nvertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter\nbranches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer\nlayers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps\nto skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training\nSystem-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first\ndistilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then\ndistilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths\n(System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our method.

We then fine-tune\nLlama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our\nextended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of\nharmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high\nrefusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates\ndrop by 70-80% after abliteration.

Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the\nmodel to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition.\nAdditionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning\nsteps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration\nand employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the previous\nSOTA by $8.6\\%$.

However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS,\ndisrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to\ndegraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods\ntypically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or\nusing data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may\nintroduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle\nlimited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint\nlearning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address\nincomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing\nscenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth\nlabels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task\nconstrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from\nmasked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations.\nIt reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation.

We introduce PIR\n(Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that\nquantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its\nimpact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and\nselectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving\nprogressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that\nmaintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity.\nModels fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling\nproperties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved\naccuracy (+0.9\\% to +6.6\\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\\% to\n-41\\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond).\nOur approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes,\ndata sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying\nreasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response\ntime, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u526a\u679d\u4f4e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u529f\u80fd\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u4f4e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "PIR\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff08+0.9%\u81f3+6.6%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11token\u4f7f\u7528\uff08-3%\u81f3-41%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "PIR\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation\nquality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately\nsteers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive\nPrincipal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and\n(iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in\nunconditional data.

Code and models:\n  https://github.com/Huster-Hq/ADD", "summary": "White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main\ncolonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical\nchromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common\nand often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However,\nWLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical\napplicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through\nglobal feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are\nsusceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic\ncues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification\nframework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp\nlocalization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation\n(ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation\nregardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to\nexplicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to\nestablish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along\nthe most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation\nreliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter\ncross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those\nsemantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis.\nExtensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by\nat least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively.

While navigation has been\nwell-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces\nremain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces\nas a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable\nusers to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as\npoking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric.\nWe demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond\nrealistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion\nprior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics\nsimulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the\ndifficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in\nthe real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in\nsynthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of\nphysics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can\ngeneralize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning\nfrom videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few\nobjects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse\ngeometries, settings, and materials.

Such a hallucination issue\nhinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving\nhallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual\ncontent. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a\nspecific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in\nLVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In\nthis paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the\nvisual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based\non our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three\naspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in\ngenerating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual\ntokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate\nprior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words.

While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges\nduring training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.\n  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its\nformation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across\nminimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear\ndevelopmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates\nin specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal\nspecialization.

Existing\npruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and\nprune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the\ninteraction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic\nquestion: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify\nredundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant\nvisual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models\nthe interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves\nbetween tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information\nrelay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy\nemerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;\nand (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to\ncontradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an\ninformation-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the\ncurrent criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the\nmodel's inherent behaviors.

However, existing paradigms typically\nperform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which\ndeviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on\nsemantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and\ntarget concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired\nFramework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual\nrecognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object,\nthen perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core\ncomponents: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human\ncognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region\nsegmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual\nconcept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual\nperception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that\nintegrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing\nselective classification over a subset of relevant categories.

To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a\nhierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image\ntry-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored\ntest sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1)\nMulti-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical\ndimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture\npreservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability,\nand hand-occlusion handling).

Most existing deepfake\ndetection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the\nvaluable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., \"VIP individuals\"\nwhose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture\nfine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity,\ncompare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over\nthese comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically,\nour framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal\nlarge language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes.\nSecond, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model\nto distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real\nand fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where\nwe model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform\nsemantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake\ndetection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works,\nwhere traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no\nhuman-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a\ndetailed understanding of specific face identities.

Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)\nframework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their\ninternal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision\nboundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model\nbehavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak\nframework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses\nthe guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's\nlatent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the\ntarget region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the\nlimitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial\nperturbations across both image and text inputs.

With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent\nunderstanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared\nto traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical\nchallenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to\nadaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task\nsituations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named\nGenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge\nIntegration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically,\nwe first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge\nfrom a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge\nintegration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions\nduring fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable\ngeneration in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based\non text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format\nassurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO,\nand CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines.

While\nprevious studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise\nand real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In\nthis paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to\ncalibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards\nLLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by\nneighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines\nnoisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase\nthe performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and\nfew-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30%\nrespectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive\nbenchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks.

To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation\nframework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit\nCamera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through\nvanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across\nmulti-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to\nthe specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of\nviews) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data.

This control mechanism not only\nimproves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be\nidentity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering.\nWith above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual\nquality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across\nspatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame\nrate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation\ntailored to diverse application scenarios.

With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the\nintended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate\nself-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently,\nknowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning.\nOur experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms\nof knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models,\napplying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLWF\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u96c5\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e22\u5f03\u65e0\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u867d\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4f18\u96c5\u9057\u5fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLWF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u52a0\u6743\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9057\u5fd8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u671f\u9057\u5fd8\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u96c5\u9057\u5fd8\u867d\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LWF\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u96c5\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Recent mask-based approaches\nyield high-quality masks by capturing global context.

In this paper, we\npresent the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective\nintelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built\nupon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text\nembedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic\nsimilarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster;\nand (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference\ntime, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The\ntop-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the\nresponse using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant.

However, complex tasks such as style-aligned\ntext-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data\nacquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR\nmodels, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt,\nresulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style\nand semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet\ndata with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining\nconventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address\nthis issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a\nspecially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to\neffectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image\ngeneration. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style\nimage and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image\nmodality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data\ntraining, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that\ntranslates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in\nAR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content\nleakage which is a common issue in previous work.

Specifically, we design a\nPerception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human\nprocess of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly\nstep-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a\ndedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement\nlearning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly\nreasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with\nlimited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves\nsuperior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on\nVAD and VAR tasks.

To this end, we conduct\ncontrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to\ntrain an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three\ntasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning.

RAUQ automatically selects such heads,\nrecurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and\ncomputes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass.\nExperiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and\ntranslation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency).\nMoreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter\ntuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAUQ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAUQ\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5934\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u79cdLLM\u548c12\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRAUQ\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\uff08<1%\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "RAUQ\u4e3a\u767d\u76d2LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our results\nsuggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and\ngeneralizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning\ncapabilities at inference-time in LLMs. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/yuanyige/W2SR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u52b1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u5f31\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6fc0\u52b1LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u529f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u7ea694%\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5230\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6fc0\u52b1LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby\nlimiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to\naddress class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to\naccommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for\ndata-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four\ncomponents: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),\nVariational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy\n(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle\nthe issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a\ndiversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes\nof old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,\nthe VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the\nprototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices\nto enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the\nimpact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.\nFinally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new\nclasses and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition\ndatasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\\% and 12.8\\% in terms of\nmean global accuracy, respectively.

However, effectively enabling LLMs\nto seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the\ncomplexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To\naddress these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,\nwhere the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds\nthrough a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to\nretrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts\nfine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM\nwith this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization\nalgorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and\nassigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a\nre-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM\niteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself\nfor search.

In contrast,\nour approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships\n(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture\nfeaturing a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality\nvisual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder\nfor end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of\ncomplex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy\nthat synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.\nSpecifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,\nand multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with\nminimal manual annotation.

Our design yields a compact yet expressive model\ncapable of photo realistic rendering across both indoor and outdoor\nenvironments, seamlessly adapting to varying levels of scene complexity.\nExperiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields\nboth compact, accurate geometry and high fidelity renderings, especially in\nchallenging scenarios where robust geometric structure make a clear difference.", "AI": {"tldr": "HaloGS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002HaloGS\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ecf\u5178\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HaloGS\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7c97\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHaloGS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "HaloGS\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Existing dynamic 3D\nreconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics\nor rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their\nextrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic\n3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on\nparticle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability\nto learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and\nfollow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the\nobserved visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian\nparticle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state\nvector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space\nencoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural\nODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in\ndynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to\ndecode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable\nrendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and\nsignificantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation.

Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View\nFusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning\nquestion-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial\ncontext with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial\nassistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal\nreasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark,\nfeaturing over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving\nspatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model,\nVLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables\nthe understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy\nand scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLM-3R\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5904\u7406\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u52303D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u9884\u6784\u5efa3D\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLM-3R\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u9690\u5f0f3D\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4-\u89c6\u89c9-\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u548c20\u4e07+3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18QA\u5bf9\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "VLM-3R\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f43D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5747\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM-3R\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f85\u52a9\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Modern approaches typically rely on large\nGaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly\ndefining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to\ndisentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro,\na precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and\nmotion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target\nmotion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically,\nMotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking\nmodel, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference\nscenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our\nregion-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly\nutilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing\nfine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the\npredicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement\nregions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video\ndenoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask\nthrough feature modulation.

This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be\nimplemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,\nachieves $5-10\\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\\times$\nfor FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDiSA\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u9000\u706b\uff08DiSA\uff09\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\u3002", "result": "DiSA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865-10\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff08MAR\u548cHarmon\uff09\u548c1.4-2.5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff08FlowAR\u548cxAR\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "DiSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u3002"}}

Due to longitudinal relaxation\nand progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over\ntime, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although\nFourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to\nbrightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address\nthese problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation\n(BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag\npattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the\nLagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by\nleveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to\nrepresent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the\nflexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate\nbiologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was\nacquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the\nimpact of brightness variations and to validate our method.

Recent studies suggest\nthat LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning\nmethods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts\nstill contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating\nthe remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation,\nrequiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address\nthis, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune.\nBased on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through\nData-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning.

However, this approach is inherently\nrestrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often\nconflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,\nindividuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation\nfrom a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time\nmulti-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a\nreference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so\nthat, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified\nlinear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional\nfine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve\ninference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion\nprocesses associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach\nwith two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL\nregularization control.

Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated\nthe potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight\nmodels, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our\ninvestigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However,\nexisting approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting\ntheir applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation\nwith full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic\ncapacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to\neffectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we\nintroduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a\ntarget model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general\ncapabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual\nlearning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression\nstrategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while\nmaintaining task-specific knowledge.

This inefficiency stems from the\nfact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more\nrollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers.\nFurthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's\nexploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of\nthe base model prior to RL.

Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in\ntoken usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both\noffering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two\nsparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing\nassumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet\nunderexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there\na deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we\nconduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By\nintroducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core\nTokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence\nand reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a\nco-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between\ntoken and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency.

The idea of the\nframework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating\nself-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer\nscoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences,\nwhile iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where\nexisting hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors\nabout the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their\nself-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward\nposteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how\nthe work is positioned and connected within and across literatures.

While\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious\nalternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to\narchitectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose\nUniversal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and\nplug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it\nwith specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the\nreward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using\npredefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into\ntoken-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at\ninference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone.\nThis additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR\nmodules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their\nlogits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on\nmathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR\nsignificantly outperforms \\add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the\nLlama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong\ngeneralization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide\nmuch larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust\nsolution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core\ncapabilities.

The broadcast\nnature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,\nbut also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can\neffectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.\nIn this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and\ninterference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent\nestimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an\ninterference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint\nposterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,\nalong with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these\ndistributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately\nestimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with\nadvanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference\ncancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces\nthe mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes\nwithout ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading\nchannel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB\nand improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ICDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u6613\u53d7\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u5e72\u6270\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u8054\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faICDM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8054\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u53ca\u4fe1\u9053\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICDM\u5728\u745e\u5229\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eMSE\uff084.54 dB\uff09\u5e76\u63d0\u5347LPIPS\uff082.47 dB\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ICDM\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning\n(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to\njointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we\nfirst reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov\ndecision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a\njoint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV\nsampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both\nviewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the\ncost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base\nsampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that\nuses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning\nsignals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward\nobjective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view\nmetrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV\ndiffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view\nfidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more\nefficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained\noptimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning\nframework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step\nT2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its\nfew-step efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6MVC-ZigAL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5c11\u6b65\u6587\u672c\u5230\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\uff08T2MV\uff09\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901fT2MV\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u53bb\u566a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faZMV-Sampling\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1MV-ZigAL\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4. \u5c06RL\u5fae\u8c03\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "MVC-ZigAL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c11\u6b65\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86T2MV\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cMVC-ZigAL\u4e3aT2MV\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Its Task Representation\nand Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to\nensure accurate interpretation.

BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,\nspanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information\nextraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,\ngrouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both\nobjective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM\nevaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective\nmetrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source\nsystems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks.\nOur evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical\nCalculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while\nsmaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,\nproprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with\nopen-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information\nExtraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring\n71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition,\nperformance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and\n50.00.

However, obtaining real datasets for every\ndisease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing\nmodalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high\ndimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight,\nlow-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the\nmissing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH\nOpen-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings\nconsistently improve the performance of competitive baselines.

A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to\noptimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires\nhuman feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,\noutcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of\nsuccess. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is\npreference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$\ngiven outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical\nroadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based\noptimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and\nonline), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately\noptimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing\nan analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose\na candidate to elect.

This raises the question of how accurately these\nmulti-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in\nmulti-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in\nstudying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such\nmulti-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates\ninformation across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to\nhigher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and\ntwo types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine\nwhich type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants\nare engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal\nmodels show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This\nstudy also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus\nmulti-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each\nmodality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one\nby one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional\ninformation beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and\nlanguage regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for\ncross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video\nmodality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the\nvideo and audio modalities.

Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over\n300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show\nthat data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM\nreasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen\nout-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies\ndiversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients.

These models are typically adapted\nfrom text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on\naudio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major\nlimitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where\nimportant textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after\ntraining on audio data.

To address these\nissues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose\ncaption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping\naudio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs\n(BALSa).

We\nfurther extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains\nthe differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that\ndescribes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental\nresults indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations\nwhile reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,\nreasoning, and instruction-following skills.

However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve\nsearching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously\nknown values, which requires novel hypotheses that \\emph{extrapolate} beyond\ntraining data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random\nsearch methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial\nstate, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that\nrewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed\nproposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces\nefficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to\nhave a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully\nextrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model\nfrom the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach\nuses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an\nautoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel\nsequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The\nproposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text\nsentiment control, and text anonymization.
