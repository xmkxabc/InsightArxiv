Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have\ndriven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or\nproperly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked\ninterest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both\ncorrectly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this\npaper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the\nsegmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel\nregularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that\nmaximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned\non each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages\nthe encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the\nnetwork's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.\nExperimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting\nunseen objects.

A critical\nbottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate\nproactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances\nleverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer\nspecialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from\nseveral shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed\ndistributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy\nin the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking\nabout tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A\nData Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User\nIntentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and\nassistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese\ntourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and\ngenerates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The\ndataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine\nimplicit user intentions.

Oftentimes, synthetic datasets do not faithfully recreate the data\ndistribution of real data, i.e., they lack the fidelity or diversity needed for\neffective downstream model training. While previous work has employed few-shot\nguidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and\ngenerate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data\nGeneration with Few-shot Guidance. Our method fine-tunes LoRA weights on\nindividual real images and fuses them at inference time, producing synthetic\nimages that combine the features of real images for improved diversity and\nfidelity of generated data. We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on\n10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to\n1000 images per class.

In\nthis paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as\na diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical\ninformation asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent\ndynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the\nparadigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and\ninstantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,\nincluding adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments\nwith GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced\nvariants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the\naccuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective\nperformance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral\ndifferences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.\nFinally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a\ncooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that\nwhile cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings,\nincreased contradiction impairs group convergence.

However, these models\n(e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled\n(clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific\nsettings such as dynamic imaging.\n  On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior\n(DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise\noverfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need\nto be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based\nmethods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number\nof sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In\nthis paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable\nweights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of\nsub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training.

Preference\noptimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to\nalign these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily\nconcentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the\nsignificance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable\nresults. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference\noptimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human\npreferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However,\nprior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile\nprocedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise\nlabeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains\nwhere such data are scarce or difficult to acquire.

However, existing methods typically\nrely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific\ntokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,\nwe uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial\ntoken is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model\nbehavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's\nattention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent\ntokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,\nwe find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more\neffectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a\nconsistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but\nvaries across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct\npreferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we\npropose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by\napplying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite\ntuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text\nclassification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across\nmodels such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves\nLlama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its\nmulti-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited\nresources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,\nand prompt variations.

When Language Models (LMs) are prompted\nwith multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant\ninformation but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information\nsources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the\ncausal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In\nthis paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting\nsearch results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study\nreveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the\nones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in\nMHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order\nof gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned\ndecoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order\naligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models\nwith bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively\nboost their end performance.

Other examples of corrupted data\ninclude videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we\ninvestigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be\nutilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical\nanalysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training\ndiffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of\ncomplementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first\ntrains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a\nmodel for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error\nbounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can\nachieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in\nthe residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the\ndifficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with\nthe signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the\nproposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89c6\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e00\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u635f\u574f\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u89c6\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u56fe\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u56fe\u672a\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e00\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Previous work in visual\nreasoning has primarily focused on reasoning segmentation, where models aim to\nsegment objects based on implicit text queries. This paper introduces reasoning\nvisual tasks (RVTs), a unified formulation that extends beyond traditional\nvideo reasoning segmentation to a diverse family of visual language reasoning\nproblems, which can therefore accommodate multiple output formats including\nbounding boxes, natural language descriptions, and question-answer pairs.\nCorrespondingly, we identify the limitations in current benchmark construction\nmethods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), which inadequately\ncapture complex spatial-temporal relationships and multi-step reasoning chains\nin video due to their reliance on token representation, resulting in benchmarks\nwith artificially limited reasoning complexity.

Previous\nworks on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling\nperspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question\ntypes. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop\nQA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types\nof cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step,\nIterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of\nmulti-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of\nmethods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to\naddress multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between\nquestion types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an\n''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes\nmultiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined\n''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the\ndebate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative\ndebater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow\ndebaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable.

In each layer, each chain from the output\nrepresentations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input\nrepresentations.

Despite their\nimpressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial\nperturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for\nsafety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find\nthat even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops\nacross all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are\nespecially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade\nsignificantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration\nframework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying\npretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing\nfoundation models.

This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring\nknowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a smaller student model by\naligning their output distributions. However, existing methods often\nunderperform in fine-grained visual recognition tasks, where distinguishing\nsubtle differences between visually similar classes is essential. This\nperformance gap stems from the fact that conventional approaches treat the\nteacher's output logits as a single, undifferentiated signal-assuming all\ncontained information is equally beneficial to the student. Consequently,\nstudent models may become overloaded with redundant signals and fail to capture\nthe teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. To address this issue, we propose\nFine-Grained Knowledge Distillation (FiGKD), a novel frequency-aware framework\nthat decomposes a model's logits into low-frequency (content) and\nhigh-frequency (detail) components using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).\nFiGKD selectively transfers only the high-frequency components, which encode\nthe teacher's semantic decision patterns, while discarding redundant\nlow-frequency content already conveyed through ground-truth supervision. Our\napproach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no access to\nintermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet,\nand multiple fine-grained recognition benchmarks show that FiGKD consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based distillation methods\nacross a variety of teacher-student configurations.

However, existing methods typically encounter\nchallenges in controlling the manipulation region and are unable to furnish the\nuser with interactive feedback, which inevitably leads to unexpected results.\nIntuitively, incorporating interactive 3D segmentation tools can compensate for\nthis deficiency. Nevertheless, existing segmentation frameworks impose a\npre-processing step of scene-specific parameter training, which limits the\nefficiency and flexibility of scene manipulation. To deliver a 3D region\ncontrol module that is well-suited for scene manipulation with reliable\nefficiency, we propose interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians\n(iSegMan), an interactive segmentation and manipulation framework that only\nrequires simple 2D user interactions in any view. To propagate user\ninteractions to other views, we propose Epipolar-guided Interaction Propagation\n(EIP), which innovatively exploits epipolar constraint for efficient and robust\ninteraction matching. To avoid scene-specific training to maintain efficiency,\nwe further propose the novel Visibility-based Gaussian Voting (VGV), which\nobtains 2D segmentations from SAM and models the region extraction as a voting\ngame between 2D Pixels and 3D Gaussians based on Gaussian visibility. Taking\nadvantage of the efficient and precise region control of EIP and VGV, we put\nforth a Manipulation Toolbox to implement various functions on selected\nregions, enhancing the controllability, flexibility and practicality of scene\nmanipulation.

SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative\nAnalysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience\nagainst sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination\ninstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and\nrobustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes\nand architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against\nnumerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on\ngeneral benchmarks.

For developing the first perspective, we\nmake use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the\ndiscriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and\nmeaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered\nwords, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between\nthe form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning\nwould be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but\nthere is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test\ndata. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English\ncompounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a\ncomputational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional\nand word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to\nassociate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of\nthe words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study\nhow the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over\ntime. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have\nread, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived\nwords is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his\noutput. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word\nwith a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of\nall derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of\nusing speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5386\u65f6\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u5f62\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5224\u522b\u8bcd\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u82ac\u5170\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u6765\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8bcd\u6c47\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f62\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u53ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5386\u65f6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5224\u522b\u8bcd\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u82ac\u5170\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u6765\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8bcd\u6c47\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "result": "DLM\u663e\u793a\u8bcd\u7f00\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u521b\u65b0\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u8bcd\u8fdc\u591a\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u521b\u65b0\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Session at\n  https://www.2025.ieeeigarss.org/view_paper.php?PaperNum=2430&SessionID=1426", "summary": "Very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has emerged as a powerful tool\nfor monitoring marine animals on a large scale. However, existing deep\nlearning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created,\nhigh-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce.\nMoreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that\nhave ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of\nthese models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study\nintroduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in\nVHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are\nused to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain\nwhales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated\nannotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher\n$\\text{F}_\\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations.\nYOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall\n$\\text{F}_\\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals,\nwith superior performance in dense scenes.

We\nshow that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a\nsubject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales\nvalidate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of\ntruthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models.\nThe distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior\nfindings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the\nactivations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades\nperformance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the\ntruthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer\nnovel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models\nand highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and\nreliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u201d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Our\nexperimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks\ndemonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios\nin terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.

However, when applied to\nlong-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational\nefficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a\ncontext compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which\naddresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant\ninformation. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer\nSemantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently\nextract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on\nthe other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level\nprimary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different\nlayers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain\ncomplete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to\ndownstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract\nknowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly\nsampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this\ncondition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression\nparadigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly\nfaster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in\nend-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and\nvarious state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "GMSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "GMSA\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7ec4\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08LSA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u5fae\u8c03\uff08KEFT\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "GMSA\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6062\u590d\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b02\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "GMSA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing studies have\nprimarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative\napproaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses.\nHowever, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the\nlinguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we\nconducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last\ndecade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as\nthe frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity,\ncohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant\nincrease in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the\nwidespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an\nincrease in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease\nin syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and\nsimplify sentence structure.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\npotential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose\ntraining objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific\nrelation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage\nKnowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that\nsynergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models,\nbridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two\nkey innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge\nand schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity;\nand (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language\nModeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational\nreasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to\neffectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in\nFSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource\nscenarios. \\footnote{The code and data are released on\nhttps://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/TKRE.", "AI": {"tldr": "TKRE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\uff08FSRE\uff09\u56e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "TKRE\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLMs\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08MSLM\u548cSCL\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTKRE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TKRE\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, LLMs have been\nused to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs.\nHowever, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be\nsimilar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world\nscenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from\nweb corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge.

While\nhigh-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its\nlimited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),\nparticularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible\nalternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized\nfor high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio\nand resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method\nfor 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of\ncontrasts and resolutions. Our method works \"out of the box\" without\nretraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed\ndistance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to\nensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI\nscans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy\ndepends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),\norientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted\nscan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived\nsurfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach\nDice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains\nmore challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of\nsub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging\npostmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step\ntoward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI.

In this paper, we propose\nLLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual\nrepresentation in 4D scene understanding.

Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory\ndemands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical\nsolution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve\nefficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video\nenhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss\nof fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate\nvarying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal\ndynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which\nlimits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive\nMulti-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE). This framework\nfeatures a coarse-to-fine two-stage process: Backtracking-based Multi-Frame\nQuantization (BMFQ) and Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD). BMFQ\nutilizes a percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning\nand backtracking for robust clipping bounds. PMTD employs a progressive\ndistillation strategy with both full-precision and multiple high-bit (INT)\nteachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality.

Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across\ntemporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data\nprocessing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as\nsemantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific\ninput-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or\ntask requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model\nincompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for\ndifferent application scenarios. This paper introduces the\nTemporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture\ndesigned for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across\ndiverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a\nTemporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to\ndecouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral,\nand spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for\ndifferent dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global\nWindow Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local\ncontextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability\nand feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous\ninputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks.

A common approach\nto improving OOD robustness is through data augmentations. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, models trained with generic augmentations can only\nimprove marginally when generalized under distribution shifts toward unlabeled\ntarget domains. While dataset-specific targeted augmentations can address this\nissue, they typically require expert knowledge and extensive prior data\nanalysis to identify the nature of the datasets and domain shift. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Frequency-Pixel Connect, a domain-adaptation\nframework that enhances OOD robustness by introducing a targeted augmentation\nin both the frequency space and pixel space. Specifically, we mix the amplitude\nspectrum and pixel content of a source image and a target image to generate\naugmented samples that introduce domain diversity while preserving the semantic\nstructure of the source image.

The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the\noutput of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify\nthem in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or\nrejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct\ntoken trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their\nreliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical\nlimitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from\nthat of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length.

Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes\nshould be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative\ncandidates.

We propose self-questioning as\na lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding,\nparticularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new\nbenchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized\nby dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark\ncenters on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between\nclosely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting\nLLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background\nknowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These\nself-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal\nknowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts\nfurther enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and\nlacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that\nchain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though\nself-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of\ntechnical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller\nmodels often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned\nquestions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do,\nrevealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration.

To address these limitations, we\npresent DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\nadapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA\nadapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which\nregularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original\nmodel.

To\nfill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT\nparadigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.\nVIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in\nthe video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT\ndatasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline.\nFirst, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning\nLLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal\nrepresentations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a\nvisual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual\nconsistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two\nnew datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To\nfurther strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward\nthat explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual\nevidence.

Although numerous detection methods have been developed to\ndifferentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts\n(HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap.\nTraditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex\nword relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation,\nwe present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection.\nInspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale\nfor the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks\nto achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs\npipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs\nbased on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph\nneural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability\nmethod extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from\nindividual words to sentence structures.

Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning\n(FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods\noften struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack\nsufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nmethod, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral\nImage Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot\nHSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to\npretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror\nSelf-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach\nenables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using\nrotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring\ntransferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently,\nhomogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via\na combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning\n(MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from\nrandomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel,\nFSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby\nembedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial\npretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous\nand homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance.

However, existing methods overlook a key\nsource of optimization tension: the separation between text and video\ndistributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap),\nand the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to\nconflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To\nmitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces\na learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to\noffload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the\nideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor\napproximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it\nas a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a\nlocally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing\nDelta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic\ngap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by\ngradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote\ninterpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region\nconstraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote\nsemantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy.\nExperiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently\nimproves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the\neffectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "GARE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u5047\u9634\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u589e\u91cfDelta_ij\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u53ca\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u9634\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "GARE\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u589e\u91cfDelta_ij\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGARE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GARE\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Each sample is paired\nwith Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables,\nencompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned\ninto GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets,\nprimarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To\ndemonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model,\nGeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text\nlabels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M.\nExperimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in\nzero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing\nadvanced models.

However, existing methods struggle to interpret\nthe complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including\nnumeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental\nconditions, and driver behavior records.

In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that\nadapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based\nreasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports\ntogether with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle\ninformation is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset.

The accuracy of tags in this dataset is shown to correlate\nwell with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy,\nTrankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks).\nAdditionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio,\ncorrelates with expert determinations of word order in three typological\ndatabases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier\ntrained on this feature can accurately identify basic word order for languages\nnot in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop\nthis dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based\ncrosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and\ncollaboration via GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3ataggedPBC\u7684\u5927\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8981\u4e48\u8986\u76d6\u5c11\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8986\u76d6\u5927\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63ed\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u666e\u904d\u7279\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1,800\u591a\u53e5POS\u6807\u8bb0\u5e73\u884c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d61,500\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6807\u8bb0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u8bb0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807N1 ratio\u3002", "conclusion": "taggedPBC\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Thermal cameras,\nwhich capture long-wave infrared radiation, are able to function effectively in\ndarkness and smoke, where visible-light cameras fail. This work explores\nlearned cross-spectral (thermal-visible) point features as a means to integrate\nthermal imagery into established camera-based navigation systems. Existing\nmethods typically train a feature network's detection and description outputs\ndirectly, which often focuses training on image regions where thermal and\nvisible-spectrum images exhibit similar appearance. Aiming to more fully\nutilize the available data, we propose a method to train the feature network on\nthe tasks of matching and registration. We run our feature network on\nthermal-visible image pairs, then feed the network response into a\ndifferentiable registration pipeline.

Nonetheless, the significant\nvariations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal\nmodel, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update\ndirections of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address\nthis issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel\nall-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature\nPerturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified\nparameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include\nchannel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically,\nchannel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in\nhigh-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise\nperturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space.

Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA),\nwhich dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained\nmodels) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling\nwithin-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity.In this way, the number of\nwithin-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only\ncross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability.\nExperiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various\nscenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models,\nSEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same\nefficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such\nas commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens\nup the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency\naccording to specific resource requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SEA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u76f8\u540c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u653b\u51fb\uff08SEA\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8fed\u4ee3\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSEA\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u9ad88.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1aAPI\u548c\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SEA\u4e3a\u6839\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

While existing methods have made notable\nprogress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well\nwhen distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion\nXL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a\npersistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity.

Backed\nby theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs\nfrom all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation\nalgorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing\npipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024\nresolution.

Existing safety\ninterventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to\ninference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept\nremoval, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or\ncollateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE,\na training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the\nweight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and\nhighly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is\nthe Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that\nidentifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over\ntoken embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain.\nIntuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the\nundesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then\napplied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target\nconcept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or\niterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and\npreserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for\nspectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on\ntheir relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the\nprocesses above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in\nonly $2$ seconds.

This challenge is\nespecially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens\nwith lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent\ntrends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance.\nSpeculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using\na smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively\nverified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output\nquality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods\nlargely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on\ntext-based draft models. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FLASH} (Fast\nLatent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework\ndesigned specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of\nmultimodal data to design the draft model.

Low-rank\napproximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches\nhave two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of\nindividual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics\nof Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small\nlow-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to\nother compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce\nruntime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small\nmatrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, a\npost-training low-rank approximation framework. $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ splits a\nTransformer layer into three functional components, namely $\\tt QK$, $\\tt OV$,\nand $\\tt MLP$. For each component, $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ provides an analytical\nsolution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while\nminimizing the component's functional loss ($\\it i.e.$, error in attention\nscores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces\nmodel sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime\noverheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the\noptimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward\nimproved end-to-end performance.

As an\ninstance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with\nNormalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple\nbenchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential\ncomputation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling\ncan be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as\nGS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow\nmodel have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in\nimage generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some\nblocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while\nothers are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose\nthe Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM\nis used to identify whether a TarFlow block is \"simple\" (converges in few\niterations) or \"tough\" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate\nwhether the initial value of the iteration is good.

This work presents a\nsystematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first\nreorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The\nreorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six\nlanguages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark\n18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned\ntraditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our\nexperiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with\nfine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can\nsignificantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs\n(including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs'\ngeneral task-solving abilities.

Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on\nEffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they\nconsistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient\nLLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \\textbf{62\\%} of human\nefficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show\nbetter efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and\nGolang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient\nthan its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into\nLLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse\nlanguages.

To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method\ncapable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently\ninterpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in\nprototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside\nlarge-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods.\nEPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and\neasy-to-understand tool for creating clear, high-quality explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPIC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u540e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u539f\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u539f\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u7c97\u7cd9\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002EPIC\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "EPIC\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u89c2\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "EPIC\u5728CUB-200-2011\u3001Stanford Cars\u548cImageNet\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EPIC\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u590d\u5236\u539f\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aXAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to\ncontinuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a\nnon-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the\npartner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five\nsimulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to\ndifferent partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The\nresults show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for\ndifferent partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve\nexplainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

While significant progress has been made, there\nare still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches\ndepend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex\nor unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second,\nmany methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and\nfinally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain\nfor guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases\ncomputational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\na wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations\nthrough a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse\ntransform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline\nthrough two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the\npixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space\nto reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate\nlatent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward\nmodel to handle unknown degradations.

However, they usually apply single\nreceptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different\nfeature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in\nmedical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing\ndiverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and\nsalient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical\nimage classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often\nunfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical\ndiagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept,\nExpert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields\n(ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and\nfairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by\napplying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different\nlesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple\nheterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like\nstructural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the\ntwo-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed\nthrough comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient\nCNN architectures.

In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for\nthis task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse\nset of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both\nrestoration-oriented and generative architectures.

Therefore, towards robust complex\nreal-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by\nadditional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced\nframework for VAD: \"PI-VAD\", a novel approach that augments RGB representations\nby five additional modalities.

Each modality represents an\naxis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two\nplug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal\nInduction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation\nand, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules\noperate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five\nmodality backbones -- only during training.

To address the need for faster density estimation for\n3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human\nmotion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative\nmodels that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an\nunconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture\ninto the density of future motions.

While\nspeculative decoding algorithms mitigate this inefficiency through parallel\nverification, they fail to exploit the inherent heterogeneity in linguistic\ncomplexity, a key factor leading to suboptimal resource allocation. We address\nthis by proposing HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding\nframework that dynamically optimizes computational resource allocation based on\nlinguistic context complexity. HeteroSpec introduces two key mechanisms: (1) A\nnovel cumulative meta-path Top-$K$ entropy metric for efficiently identifying\npredictable contexts. (2) A dynamic resource allocation strategy based on\ndata-driven entropy partitioning, enabling adaptive speculative expansion and\npruning tailored to local context difficulty. Evaluated on five public\nbenchmarks and four models, HeteroSpec achieves an average speedup of\n4.26$\\times$. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3 across\nspeedup rates, average acceptance length, and verification cost.

To address this, we propose ARENA\n(Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator\nframework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards.\nBased on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our\nRL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform\nstructured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces.\nApplied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments\nwith various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30%\nimprovements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA\nCommercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses\nshow that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without\nextra training.

In\nhumans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of\ninformation, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear.\nWe present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to\nreshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how\npersona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support\nthis analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a\njailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from\nVLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;\nand a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired\nwith corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across\nmodel families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for\ntrue news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this\neffect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas\nRepublican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the\ntested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual\nmisinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model\nbehavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and\nmitigation strategies for personalized AI systems.

However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:\n(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating\nand optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of\nmethods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal\nperception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary\nFramework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning\nboundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a\ncombination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable\nguidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in\nmultimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces\nunmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the\nreasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two\nsub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both\nunmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive\nexperiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our\nframework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies,\noffer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives,\nand expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning.

Conventional RGB-D\nsensors often struggle to align precisely and capture reliable depth under such\nconditions. In contrast, event cameras with their high temporal resolution and\nsensitivity to motion at the pixel level provide complementary cues that are\n%particularly beneficial in dynamic environments.To this end, we propose\nEventDC, the first event-driven depth completion framework. It consists of two\nkey components: Event-Modulated Alignment (EMA) and Local Depth Filtering\n(LDF). Both modules adaptively learn the two fundamental components of\nconvolution operations: offsets and weights conditioned on motion-sensitive\nevent streams. In the encoder, EMA leverages events to modulate the sampling\npositions of RGB-D features to achieve pixel redistribution for improved\nalignment and fusion. In the decoder, LDF refines depth estimations around\nmoving objects by learning motion-aware masks from events.

To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various\ntraining pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly\nadvancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset\ndistillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation\nduring the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger\ndatasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy\nstill a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our\nempirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods\noften stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the\nimages themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior\nresults.

However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results\nin substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems\nadmit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs\nlearn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable\nframework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and\nlong-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.\nThinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two\ncontrol tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed\nreasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of\nhybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the\nselection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the\naccuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables\nfine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing\ntraining and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.\nEmpirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and\nGSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -\n90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

But separate training of these two models\nmakes them vulnerable to unknown attacks and burdens deployment environments.\nThe lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to handle both types of\nattacks is mainly due to two factors. First, there's a lack of adequate\nbenchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack\ntypes and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats.\nTo address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most\nextensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date.

So, we present a novel\nVisual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework (HiPTune) that\nadaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic\nspaces. We build a Visual Prompt Tree to explore various classification rules\nhierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select\nthe most suitable prompts to guide the encoder to extract discriminative\nfeatures at different levels in a coarse-to-fine way. Finally, to help the\nmodel understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a\nDynamically Prompt Integration module to project the visual prompts to the text\nencoder for more accurate semantics.

In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,\nwhich prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the\nfinal solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both\nperformance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel\nRL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode\nadaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two\ncore components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the\nmodel to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an\nimportance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples\nduring on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model\nto explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process.

Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning\nto enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba1\u7b97\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5eb7\u590d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5eb7\u590d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u548c\u5bf9\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\u6216\u8dcc\u5012\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565KinTwin\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u8282\u626d\u77e9\u548c\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, current\ndiscrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders\n(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of\ndetails and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,\nwithout isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core\ntasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and\ncovers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess\nstate-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of\nreconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior\nvisual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining\nspatial structure and semantic detail.

To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for\nself-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames\nor multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In\nthe first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space\nwithout relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict\nper-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis\nmodel as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially\nreduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the\nunderlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent\ncamera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the\nreal 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by\nexplicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit\nGaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the\nlearned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this\nway, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D\nconsistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared\nto methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth\ninformation.

To bridge the gap between\nautomated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel\nsupervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3\nseconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating\nsurrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as\nautomated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert\nissues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation,\nenhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development\nand evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark\ndataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It\ncontains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications\nacross annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable\nmethodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining\nsurrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over\nstructured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it\nbroadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable\noversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with\n69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\\% F1-score.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting\nentities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in\nRNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with\ndiverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.\nThroughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities\nand concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities\nin neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated\nconcepts.

During this time,\npatients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological\nfactors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for\nensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ\nmotion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration\nquality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion\nmodeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely\nresembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based\non previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future\norgan motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion\nprediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific\nmotion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before\ntreatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases\nare fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior\nphase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT\nscans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a\npublic dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple\nscans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the\nmotion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images.

EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM\ngenerates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language\nspecification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new\noutput (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats\nthe process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical\nstrategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack\nsetups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming.\nWe evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found\nthat EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1\nperformance within ten loops.

This can result in biased inferences, where\nplausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.\nMitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness\nand generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical\nconsistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases\non formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a\ncontrolled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from\ncontent plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and\nmaterial inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for\ntest-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs\nreveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over\ncontent biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for\nimproving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control\ncontent effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters\nvia fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is\neffective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in\nformal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).\nFinally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is\nrobust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling\ncapabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning\ntasks.

To address\nthe challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution\npatterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model,\nCTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer\narchitecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention\nmechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention\nmechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention\ninteraction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global\nstructures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing\nnoise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention\ndistribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on\nhigh-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby\nenhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore,\nCTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and\nuses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further\nstrengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016\nNational Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset\ndemonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both\ndenoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of\nLDCT images.

Although ultrasound imaging\noffers greater accessibility and cost-effectiveness compared to MRI,\ntraditional transrectal ultrasound methods suffer from low sensitivity,\nespecially in detecting anteriorly located tumors. Ultrasound computed\ntomography provides quantitative tissue characterization, but its clinical\nimplementation faces significant challenges, particularly under anatomically\nconstrained limited-angle acquisition conditions specific to prostate imaging.\nTo address these unmet needs, we introduce OpenPros, the first large-scale\nbenchmark dataset explicitly developed for limited-view prostate USCT. Our\ndataset includes over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D speed-of-sound\n(SOS) phantoms and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from\nanatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from real clinical\nMRI/CT scans and ex vivo ultrasound measurements, annotated by medical experts.\nSimulations are conducted under clinically realistic configurations using\nadvanced finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta acoustic wave solvers,\nboth provided as open-source components.

Existing\nproactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the\nforgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the\nintricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nVoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of\nobfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential\nunauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to\nidentify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt\nthe cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference\naudio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets\nspeaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize\nidentity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles.\nAdditionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes,\nparticularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal\ncharacteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning.

In this work, we observe that the in-distribution\ninput semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect\nto the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a\nnovel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding\ndistances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary.\nEvaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers,\nour method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\\% over the\nbest-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our\nmethod through experiments on nine different backbones.

However, alongside these successes, a more\ndeceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where\nlogically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive\nyet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are\nembedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and\npotentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations\nfrom a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which\nquantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits\nobtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space,\neffectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep\nreasoning.

This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods\nfor anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the\nfirst part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data\nfollows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We\nintroduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a\nhigh-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers\nusing two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and\nRuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also\npropose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming\nscenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real\ndatasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel\nmethod for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.\nMultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust\nmulti-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing\napproaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved\nrobustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses\nonline anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation\nForest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and\ndynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids\nretraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior\nefficiency for real-time applications.

Translations between each modality are established as core\ntasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription\n(audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score).\nHowever, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on\nindividual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach,\nwhere we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks\nsimultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new\nlarge-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose\na new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score\nimage data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger\nthan any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified\ntokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into\na sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle\nmultiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.\nExperimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon\nsingle-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error\nrate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,\nwhile similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other\ntranslation tasks.

However, performing these computations directly in the physical space\noften incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several\nneural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent\nspace to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity,\nthey often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly\nsampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast,\nconvolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but\nare limited to regular discretizations.
