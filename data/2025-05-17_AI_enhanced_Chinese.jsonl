Its versatility enables real-time\napplications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS\nfaces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as\npopping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in\ndisturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when\nrendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for\nVR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by\nlarge field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of\nhead-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine\nand extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR\nholistically.

While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes.

The\nproposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses\nunder large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping\nconstraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in\nrendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce\ncontinuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited\nmemory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the\nrelative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and\nfeature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and\nGaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction\nquality.

Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language\nmodels like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal\nimages. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,\ncomplex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in\nlimited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method\ncalled AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual\nrepresentations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,\ncomparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate\nboth contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on\nresidual features.

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,\nparticularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images\nand pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.\nMoreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to\naddress these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of\ndomain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to\ngenerate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model\nand allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without\nintroducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent\nfrequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a\nsource-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related\nlayer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target\nmodel using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels.

In real-world applications, models are\ntypically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the\nenvironment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in\nmodel performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on\nentropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing\nmodel stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation\nmechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers\nwith those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation\nand source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we\nconstruct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA\nbenchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU\nimprovements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference.

We introduce PointArena, a\ncomprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse\nreasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a\ncurated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five\nreasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena\nfacilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over\n4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation\nsystem allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing\ncapabilities in practical settings.

Most existing approaches have\nadopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and\nsentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited\nsubset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many\ncorrespondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different\ndescriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit\nconnections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying\nrationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In\nthis work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn\nthe graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the\ndescriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of\neach sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency\n(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the\nsentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust\nimage-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,\ndynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and\n(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a\ngeneric-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM\nenhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.\nExtensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model can\neffectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of\n65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved\nmodel holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is\nwell-suited for autonomous driving competitions, such as the Formula Student\nAutonomous China (FSAC), particularly excelling in scenarios involving\nsingle-target and small-object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eYOLOv8\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7ed3\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u5149\u7167\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5728YOLOv8\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7ed3\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523065%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7ade\u8d5b\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, adapting these models\nwith limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their\nability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,\nmodality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features.

VQ-Logits replaces the\nlarge V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K\nembedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of\nthese K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,\nwhich are then efficiently \"scattered\" to the full vocabulary space using the\nlearned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on\nstandard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits\ncan achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in\nlogit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to\nfull softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on\ncodebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the\nrobustness and effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "VQ-Logits\u5229\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1199%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476\u500d\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a04%\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u7801\u672c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5d4c\u5165\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7d27\u51d1\u7801\u672c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6620\u5c04\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u8bcd\u6c47\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1199%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476\u500d\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4ec5\u589e\u52a04%\u3002", "conclusion": "VQ-Logits\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, existing methods rely\nlargely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits\ngeneralization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video\nCrafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences\n(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new\ndirection for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our\nMTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,\nsurpassing the second-best by 65%.

In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be\ntrained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image\nmodeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a\nunified membership inference method called PartCrop.

Recent work highlights the\npotential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with\na quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and\ncostly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise\naligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to\nhigh-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by\nproposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need\nfor direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with\nmatching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function\nguided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature\nmaps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning\ncolor and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset.

The most\nfrequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and\ndamage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related\nlatent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one\nhealth. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60\npercentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest\ntotal volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated\nsocial media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable\nmulti-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse\nanalysis.

First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the\namount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the\nchallenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.\nSecond, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to\nambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for\nannotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a\nnovel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by\nthe number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the\nlargest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model,\npre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other\nlanguage SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language\ntransfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple\nclassification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the\nmost. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually\nsimilar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs\nimproves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based\non the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results\nfor the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a\nsingle stream model processing solely RGB video.

Chan"], "title": "Predictability Shapes Adaptation: An Evolutionary Perspective on Modes of Learning in Transformers", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),\nencoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting\nflexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability.

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of\njailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage\nand jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework\ntargeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the\nlimitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII\nentities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build\na privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based\nstrategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods\nusing two privacy-related datasets.

However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute\nmatters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the\nclassification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in\ntraining datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using\npurely feasible or infeasible datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff08feasibility\uff09\u5bf9CLIP\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u72d7\u6d6e\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u662f\u5426\u5bf9CLIP\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVariReal\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u884c\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5LoRA\u5fae\u8c03CLIP\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5bf9CLIP\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5dee\u5f02<0.3%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5bf9CLIP\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u3002"}}

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users\noften struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable\nclassification.

Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,\na 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's\nclassification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm\nbehavior.

However, the projection dataset is large and\nriddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to\nunprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning\ndifficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details.\nTo address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model\n(OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT\nprojection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model\n(MSDM) to learn from each subset independently.

With the ability to reveal\nmultiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating\ninto the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to\nimprove gastrointestinal imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u5149\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\uff08MLE\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u7167\u660e\u589e\u5f3a\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u8272\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u767d\u5149\u548c\u7a84\u5e26\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u767d\u5149\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u75be\u75c5\u65f6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb8\u591a\u75c5\u4f8b\u6f0f\u8bca\u3002", "method": "MLE\u5e73\u53f0\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u6563\u6591\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u5149\u5ea6\u7acb\u4f53\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "MLE\u572831\u4e2a\u606f\u8089\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea63\u500d\uff0c\u8272\u5dee\u63d0\u53475\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MLE\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
