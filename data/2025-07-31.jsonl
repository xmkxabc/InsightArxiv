Whereas, the base station (BS)\napplies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private\nand a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive\nclosed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage\nprobability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We\nformulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS\nunder unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we\npropose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is\ndesigned using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex\napproximation (SCA).

During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities.

PDAF\nintroduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this\nprior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.\nTo achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and\nutilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain\nshifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the\nLatent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the\nDomain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate\ndomain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion\nprocess to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design\nenables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature\nrepresentations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and\nchallenging urban scenes.", "comment": "Accepted by ICCV2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21367v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-28", "updated": "2025-07-28"}

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we\ndevise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select\nreliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of\nunlabeled data.

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges\nfor efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network\npruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational\nrequirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant\nparameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally\nremoving redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning\ntechniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,\nresulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,\na novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top\nof any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant\nfilters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted\nQR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent\nfilters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's\nkernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any\nfine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no\nretraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and\ninference speedups over a state-of-the-art method.

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are\nnecessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic\ninterpretations.

Given the disturbance\nzonotope, the databased closed-loop dynamics (CLDs) are first characterized\nusing a matrix zonotope (MZ), and refined through several steps to yield a\nconstrained matrix zonotope (CMZ). This refinement is achieved by introducing\nconformal equality constraints that eliminate incompatible disturbance\nrealizations. More precisely, prior knowledge and observed data are used\nseparately to construct CMZ representations of disturbance sequences that\nconform to both data and prior knowledge, and are intersected by the initial MZ\nof the disturbance sequence, producing a refined CMZ. This approach reduces\nconservatism. To further reduce the conservativeness, we unify open-loop\nlearning with closed-loop learning by presenting a novel set-membership\nidentification method that models open-loop dynamics as a CMZ. The prior\nknowledge serves as an initial feasible open-loop model set (FOLMS) of this\nCMZ, which is refined into a posterior set whenever new informative online data\nbecomes available. This posterior FOLMS then adaptively replaces the prior\nknowledge set employed in the disturbance elimination of the closed-loop\nlearning process.

ArtSeek integrates three key\ncomponents: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late\ninteraction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for\npredicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning\nstrategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question\nanswering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is\nWikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to\nsupport knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1\nimprovement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in\ncaptioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret\nvisual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even\nfor obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to\nother domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI\nresearch.

However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in\nmodels trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from\nlimitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object\nboundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where\nemissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.\n  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge\nto mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address\nthe model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we\npropose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem\nwithout relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a\nsingle network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and\nViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture\nconsistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate\npost-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve\npseudo mask quality.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21959v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-29", "updated": "2025-07-29"}

In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional\nTransformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context\nimplicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly.\nSpecifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and\nright-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model to serve as a\nregularization for implicitly exploiting bidirectional context and optionally\nallowing explicit interaction of the bidirectional flows, while the final\ncaption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level ensemble\nmanner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on MSCOCO benchmark and find that\nthe compact bidirectional architecture and the sentence-level ensemble play\nmore important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining with\nword-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of sentence-level ensemble is\nfurther enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical\ntraining to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new\nstate-of-the-art results in comparison with non-vision-language-pretraining\nmodels. Finally, we verify the generality of this compact bidirectional\narchitecture by extending it to LSTM backbone.

However, its greedy-selection\nmemory design suffers from the \"error accumulation\" problem, where an errored\nor missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent\nframes, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos.\nTo this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object\nsegmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each\nframe and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation\npathways in a constrained tree search manner.

While agent-based models\n(ABMs) provide detailed insights into individual dynamics, accurately\nreplicating human motion remains challenging due to its complex,\nmulti-factorial nature. Most existing frameworks fail to model realistic human\nmotion, leading to oversimplified and less realistic behavior modeling.\nFurthermore, many current models rely on synthetic assumptions and fail to\naccount for realistic environmental structures, transportation systems, and\nbehavioral heterogeneity across occupation groups. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce AVSim, an agent-based simulation framework designed\nto model airborne and vector-borne disease dynamics under realistic conditions.\nA distinguishing feature of AVSim is its ability to accurately model the dual\nnature of human mobility (both the destinations individuals visit and the\nduration of their stay) by utilizing GPS traces from real-world participants,\ncharacterized by occupation. This enables a significantly more granular and\nrealistic representation of human movement compared to existing approaches.\nFurthermore, spectral clustering combined with graph-theoretic analysis is used\nto uncover latent behavioral patterns within occupations, enabling fine-grained\nmodeling of agent behavior. We validate the synthetic human mobility patterns\nagainst ground-truth GPS data and demonstrate AVSim's capabilities via\nsimulations of COVID-19 and dengue.

This\nencourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant\nrepresentations, thereby improving its focus on clinically significant regions.\nAs a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and\nrobustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on\nmultiple public datasets, including medical segmentation decathalon dataset\n(lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of\n1-3% over baseline methods in various segmentation tasks. To further assess\nperformance under limited data conditions, additional experiments are conducted\non the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training\nsamples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung\ncancer dataset for the segmentation of gross tumor volume in cone beam CT,\nwhere it achieves a 4-5% improvement over baseline.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18177v2", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-24", "updated": "2025-07-29"}

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

Quantization methods compress model size through\nreplacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower\nprecision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy\npreservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to\nextend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we\nlook into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's\npartial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ\nmethod with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key\ninsights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through\nfull retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This\ngain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware\ntraining. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we\npropose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends\nits performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available\nmethod relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes\npreserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments\non LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's\naccuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively.

This is further strengthened by a\ndimension-wise gating network, which adaptively modulates feature contributions\nat the channel level to emphasize salient information. In parallel, dual-path\nencoders independently refine modality-specific representations, while an\nadditional cross-attention layer aligns the modalities further. The resulting\nfeatures are aggregated via an expert fusion module that integrates learned\ngating and self-attention, yielding a robust unified representation.\nExperimental results on the MIMIC and SemEval Memotion 1.0 datasets show that\nCo-AttenDWG achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior cross-modal\nalignment, highlighting its effectiveness for diverse multi-modal applications.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19010v2", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-05-25", "updated": "2025-07-30"}

With the rapid advancement of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with\nLLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach\ntypically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and\ndisparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias\nthe LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often\nderived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks\nremains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language\nModeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual\nsequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information\ninherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different\ngraph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm.\nSpecifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on\nmetapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a\nHG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for\nfine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to\ngeneralize to unseen target HGs.
