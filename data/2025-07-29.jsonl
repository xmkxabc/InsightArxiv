While self-hosted Ethereum nodes offer\noperational control, they often lack elasticity and require complex\nmaintenance. This paper presents a hybrid, service-oriented architecture for\ndeploying and monitoring Ethereum full nodes using Amazon Managed Blockchain\n(AMB), integrated with EC2-based observability, IAM-enforced security policies,\nand reproducible automation via the AWS Cloud Development Kit. Our architecture\nsupports end-to-end observability through custom EC2 scripts leveraging Web3.py\nand JSON-RPC, collecting over 1,000 real-time data points-including gas\nutilization, transaction inclusion latency, and mempool dynamics. These metrics\nare visualized and monitored through AWS CloudWatch, enabling service-level\nperformance tracking and anomaly detection. This cloud-native framework\nrestores low-level observability lost in managed environments while maintaining\nthe operational simplicity of managed services. By bridging the simplicity of\nAMB with the transparency required for protocol research and enterprise\nmonitoring, this work delivers one of the first reproducible,\nperformance-instrumented Ethereum deployments on AMB.

This\ndifficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax)\nremains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy\nand limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has\nincreasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this\nML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee\ntraining pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which\nundermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce NeuCall, a\nnovel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks.\nExisting ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and\ncode cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's\ncontrol flow. In contrast, NeuCall augments CFGs with cross-references,\npreserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced\ncompiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training\npairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph\nneural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions\nfor accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from\nGitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, NeuCall achieves an\nF1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches.

While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy.

To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance\nprompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to\nguide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating\ncertain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key\nvariables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and\nHLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of\nthe discrepancy symptoms. To reduce test time, a testing input generation\nmechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an\nLLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing\nis skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test\ninputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing\nframework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher\ntestbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the\ndirect use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.", "comment": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.03889", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14641v3", "cate": "cs.SE", "date": "2025-04-20", "updated": "2025-07-24"}

Our results reveal a fundamental\ntrade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity\nattention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more\nrobust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\\% on the OOD set.\nIntriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive\naccuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be\ndominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual\ninformation. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the\nauditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech\nrepresentations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD\ntesting is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced\ninsights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory\nhierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19052v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-07-25", "updated": "2025-07-25"}

Trade, commonly regarded as the origin\nof financial systems, is reframed here as the canonical form of reciprocity:\nsimultaneous, symmetric, and partner-contingent. Building on this logic, we\nreconstruct four core financial functions-credit, insurance, token exchange,\nand investment-as expressions of the same underlying principle under varying\nconditions. By grounding financial behavior in minimal, simulateable dynamics\nof reciprocal interaction, this framework shifts the focus from institutional\nengineering to behavioral computation-offering a new foundation for modeling\ndecentralized financial behavior in both human and artificial agents.", "comment": "Position paper on LLM-agent simulation of financial structures.

This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19427v1", "cate": "cs.LG", "date": "2025-07-25", "updated": "2025-07-25"}

Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by\nStudent t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered\nembeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the\nfeatures.

In this work, we formalize point cloud querying\nby defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each\naligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on\nindexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide\naccurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,\nstate-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object\ncounts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this\nlimitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for\naccurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing\non accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding\nobject centers to improve counting accuracy.

In\ncontrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and\ninterpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut\nboundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable\nCut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection\ninto a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut\nstrategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently,\nand sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine\noptimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable\nImportance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their\ncontributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike\nad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces\nhard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training\nprocess. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs.\nQCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries\nacross typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential\nstrategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with\nminimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4.\nperforms effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF\ninitially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when\nusing all observables. However, pruning less critical features-guided by\nlearned importance-boosts its performance to match or exceed these baselines.\nLCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box\nneural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and\nfeature importance.", "comment": "31 pages, 26 figures, 8 tables, source code and data are available at\n  GitHub", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22498v2", "cate": "cs.LG", "date": "2025-03-28", "updated": "2025-07-25"}

Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately.

In\nthis setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by\nchoosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables,\naccommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying\nnon-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and\ninteracting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and\nreturns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that\nreceives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and\nbehavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards\nacross the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to\nwell-performing candidates.

In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that\nautoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language\ninputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including\nVideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information\nfrom prior brain states and current stimuli via dual cross-attention mechanisms\nthat attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well\nas narrative information provided by high-level summaries of the content. One\ncore innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context\nto predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture\nlong-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is\nthe combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder,\nwhich leverages common representational structure across subjects while\naccounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on\nboth in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain\nactivity prediction.

However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when\ncombined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high\ninference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (Text Embeddings\nFusion), a novel and efficient distillation method that directly incorporates\nthe guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and distills the teacher\nmodel's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing conditional and\nunconditional text embeddings using linear operations, TeEFusion reconstructs\nthe desired guidance without adding extra parameters, simultaneously enabling\nthe student model to learn from the teacher's output produced via its\nsophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art\nmodels such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the student to closely\nmimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more efficient sampling\nstrategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference speeds up to\n6$\\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image quality at\nlevels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex sampling\napproach.
