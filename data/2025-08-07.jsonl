As a result of\ntheir speculative nature and lack of off-chain opportunity verification,\noptimistic MEV transactions frequently decide not to execute any trades.\n  In this work, we focus on cyclic arbitrage, which we find is predominantly\nexecuted as optimistic MEV on Layer 2s.

We\nintroduce a novel multimodal approach, \\textit{namely},\n\\textit{\\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic\ncontent in memes. \\textit{\\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image\nmodalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a\ncross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily\nprocessed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and\nLarge Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed\non a newly curated dataset (\\textit{\\textbf{W}hat's \\textbf{B}eneath\n\\textbf{M}isogynous \\textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting\nmisogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,\n\\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only\ndetects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of\nhow misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach compared to existing methods.

Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space.

Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor\nachieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction\nerror < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1\nminute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52\nseconds), achieving over 64 times speedup.

Since\nset-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for\ntype narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and\nperformance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has\nbeen driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various\nlanguage communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and\nundesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly\nmore complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra\ncomplexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the\nproblems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type\nnarrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple\nprograms that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional\nperformance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to\nvalidate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems\nare not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided\nthey are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time\nperformance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,\nthe documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with\ntypechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical\ndimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set\nof topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should\ntypecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a\nbaseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides\ncriteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and\nnegative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the\npayoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can\nuse the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is\nworthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available\nonline. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:\nTypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight\nimportant differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among\nprogram variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.\n**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the\ntradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T\nclarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each\nlevel of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,\ncross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better\nbalance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03830v1", "cate": "cs.PL", "date": "2025-08-05", "updated": "2025-08-05", "section": "new"}

In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by\ncompilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process\nstandardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such\ncomponents were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such\nas a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of\nsoftware evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs\nthey actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to\nreconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches\nalready produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is\navailable to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this\ncompleteness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during\nthe operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for\ngrammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs\nbut not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software\ncomponent. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no\nlonger appear in the available input data are missing from the generated\ngrammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for\nthe automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input\ngenerators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether\nthey are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,\nthis work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach\nleverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms\nto overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,\nthe search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with\na single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is\nstructured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of\ninputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a\ndiverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.\nResults demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for\nextracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners\nsuch as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases\nin parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness\nof the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve\nhigh performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This\ncontribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software\nengineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar\nmining.

The objectives of\nour research were: (1) to present the psychological and philosophical\nfoundations of human trust, (2) to systematically study how trust is\nconceptualized in SE and the related disciplines human-computer interaction and\ninformation systems, and (3) to discuss limitations of equating trust with\ncontent acceptance, outlining how SE research can adopt existing trust models\nto overcome the widespread informal use of the term trust. We conducted a\nliterature review across disciplines and a critical review of recent SE\narticles focusing on conceptualizations of trust. We found that trust is rarely\ndefined or conceptualized in SE articles. Related disciplines commonly embed\ntheir methodology and results in established trust models, clearly\ndistinguishing, for example, between initial trust and trust formation and\nbetween appropriate and inappropriate trust. On a meta-scientific level, other\ndisciplines further discuss whether and when trust can be applied to AI\nassistants at all. Our study reveals a significant maturity gap of trust\nresearch in SE compared to related disciplines. We provide concrete\nrecommendations on how SE researchers can adopt established trust models and\ninstruments to study trust in AI assistants beyond the acceptance of generated\nsoftware artifacts.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12461", "cate": "cs.SE", "date": "2025-04-16", "updated": "2025-08-05", "section": "repl"}

This\neffect, known as performativity, describes how financial theories and the\nsubsequent actions based on them influence market processes, by creating\nself-fulfilling prophecies. Although discussed in the literature on economic\nsociology, this deeply rooted phenomenon lacks mathematical formulation in\nfinancial markets. Our paper closes this gap by breaking down the canonical\nseparation of diffusion processes between the description of the market\nenvironment and the financial model. We do that by embedding the model in the\nprocess itself, creating a closed feedback loop, and demonstrate how prices\nchange towards greater conformity to the prevailing financial model used in the\nmarket. We further show, with closed-form solutions and machine learning, how a\nperformative market maker can reverse engineer the current dominant strategies\nin the market and effectively arbitrage them while maintaining competitive\nquotes and superior P&L.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04344", "cate": "q-fin.TR", "date": "2025-08-06", "updated": "2025-08-06", "section": "cross"}
