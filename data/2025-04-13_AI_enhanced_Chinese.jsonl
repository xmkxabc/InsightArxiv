Existing benchmarks often overlook intra-language variations,\nleaving speakers of non-standard dialects underserved. To address this gap, we\nintroduce EnDive (English Diversity), a benchmark that evaluates five\nwidely-used large language models (LLMs) across tasks in language\nunderstanding, algorithmic reasoning, mathematics, and logic. Our framework\ntranslates Standard American English datasets into five underrepresented\ndialects using few-shot prompting with verified examples from native speakers,\nand compare these translations against rule-based methods via fluency\nassessments, preference tests, and semantic similarity metrics. Human\nevaluations confirm high translation quality, with average scores of at least\n6.02/7 for faithfulness, fluency, and formality. By filtering out\nnear-identical translations, we create a challenging dataset that reveals\nsignificant performance disparities - models consistently underperform on\ndialectal inputs compared to Standard American English.

Recent advances in 3D content\ngeneration have been driven by large-scale datasets such as Objaverse, which\ncontains over 800,000 3D objects collected from the Internet. Although\nObjaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is\nlimited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation,\nwe manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including\naesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object\ncomposition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural\nnetwork capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset.\nThrough experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that\nmodels pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance\nthan those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation\ntasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by\nour tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the\ntraining loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich\nannotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more\nefficient path to develop 3D generative models.

However, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or\nAudio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) models often struggle in noisy\nscenarios. To solve this task, we propose a model that improves transcription\nby correlating noise sources to visual cues. Unlike works that rely on lip\nmotion and require the speaker's visibility, we exploit broader visual\ninformation from the environment. This allows our model to naturally filter\nspeech from noise and improve transcription, much like humans do in noisy\nscenarios. Our method re-purposes pretrained speech and visual encoders,\nlinking them with multi-headed attention. This approach enables the\ntranscription of speech and the prediction of noise labels in video inputs.

Since the appearance of 3D gaussians is\nview-dependent, the color of a gaussian can thus be certain from an angle and\nuncertain from another.

Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically\nrely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to\nfacilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these\nmodels often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading\nto poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast,\nmethods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on\nvarious aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images\nthat can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a\nnovel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists\nof a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational\nauto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space\nand a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation\nprocedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective\nand enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis\ncapabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a\nstate-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our\nmethod facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity\nseparability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In\nturn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale\ndatasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a\nprivacy-preserving manner.

Unlike traditional time series that rely on fixed\ntemporal sampling to capture steady-state behaviors, events encode transient\ndynamics through polarity and event intervals, making signal modeling\nsignificantly more complex. To address this, the theoretical foundation of\nevent generation is revisited through the lens of diffusion processes. The\nstate and process information within events is modeled as continuous\nprobability flux at threshold boundaries of the underlying irradiance\ndiffusion. Building on this insight, a generative, online filtering framework\ncalled Event Density Flow Filter (EDFilter) is introduced. EDFilter estimates\nevent correlation by reconstructing the continuous probability flux from\ndiscrete events using nonparametric kernel smoothing, and then resamples\nfiltered events from this flux. To optimize fidelity over time, spatial and\ntemporal kernels are employed in a time-varying optimization framework.

The core of R1 lies in its\nrule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic\nground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the\nvisual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding\ntasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This\nproperty makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms.\nMotivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style\nreinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance\ntheir visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a\ndedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on\ngeneral vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the\nfeasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that\nthe RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual\nunderstanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in\ngeneralization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies\nthat uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward\nhacking in object detection, the emergence of the \"OD aha moment\", the impact\nof training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model\nsizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how\nreinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and\nwe hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued\nprogress in the vision-language RL community.

To address these issues,\nwe propose a Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework that mimics the\ndoctor's diagnostic process. This RAG framework can analyze diagnosis\ninformation of potential diseases and accurately conduct multi-round diagnosis\nlike a doctor. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks, we\nconduct experiments on two modern medical datasets and two traditional Chinese\nmedicine datasets, with evaluations by GPT and human doctors on different\nmethods.

Existing methods typically assume that each\ntraining image is accurately depicted by its textual descriptions. However,\ntextual descriptions can be ambiguous and fail to depict discriminative visual\ndetails in images, leading to inaccurate representation learning. To alleviate\nthe effects of text ambiguity, we propose a Multi-Modal Reference learning\nframework to learn robust representations. We first propose a multi-modal\nreference construction module to aggregate all visual and textual details of\nthe same object into a comprehensive multi-modal reference. The multi-modal\nreference hence facilitates the subsequent representation learning and\nretrieval similarity computation. Specifically, a reference-guided\nrepresentation learning module is proposed to use multi-modal references to\nlearn more accurate visual and textual representations. Additionally, we\nintroduce a reference-based refinement method that employs the object\nreferences to compute a reference-based similarity that refines the initial\nretrieval results.

The results demonstrate that C-Prune effectively reduces model size\nwhile outperforming existing MoE pruning methods.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC-Prune\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684MoE LLMs\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5185\u4e13\u5bb6\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "C-Prune\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "C-Prune\u4e3aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the\nsubtlety of actions. To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised\nMAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled. We first evaluate\ntraditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these\nmethods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error\naccumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the\ncommon practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as\npseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nframework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which\nexplicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the\noffline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels.\nMoreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically\nfilter noisy labels of different classes. We then build a memory-based\nprototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and\nused to guide the subsequent model training phase. By alternating the two\npseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model\ncan not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the\noverfitting issue.

Transformer models make use of self-attention mechanisms to\neffectively capture global relationships across spatial and temporal\ndimensions, which makes them suitable for complex gesture recognition tasks.\nThe VideoMAE model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 75.58% on the WLASL100 dataset,\nhighlighting its strong performance compared to traditional CNNs with 65.89%.\nOur study demonstrates that transformer-based architectures have great\npotential to advance SLR, overcome communication barriers and promote the\ninclusion of DHH individuals.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eVideo Vision Transformer (ViViT) \u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8bcd\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u624b\u8bed(ASL)\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u542c\u529b\u4eba\u7fa4\u5bf9\u624b\u8bed\u4e0d\u719f\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b(SLR)\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728WLASL100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVideoMAE\u6a21\u578b\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523075.58%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u768465.89%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u6c9f\u901a\u969c\u788d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u804b\u54d1\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

Hence, we conduct a series exploration of\ndiscrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask\nNetwork (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal\nsampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues.

Our key insight is that the difficulty of\ntraining data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical.

Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in\naccurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering.

These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards\nretrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query.

We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by\nshowing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone\ncan degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of\nexisting RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer\nquality.

We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit\nQuantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery,\ndirectly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits --\nwhich we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance.\nThese weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized,\nmaintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically,\nTaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to\nestimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient\ninformation to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to\npreserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing\nmixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose\nand task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for\nboth Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the\nsame calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements\nin the 2 and 3-bit regime.

The core of R1 lies in its\nrule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic\nground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the\nvisual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding\ntasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This\nproperty makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms.\nMotivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style\nreinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance\ntheir visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a\ndedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on\ngeneral vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the\nfeasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that\nthe RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual\nunderstanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in\ngeneralization ability.

Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how\nreinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and\nwe hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued\nprogress in the vision-language RL community.

Previous\nMLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between \"Ref\" and \"VOS\":\nthey either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or\ntracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external\nVOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our\nframework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a\nsingle video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse \"context frames\" provides\nglobal information, while a stream of continuous \"query frames\" conducts local\nobject tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a\npre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range\ntemporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited\ncontext window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to\ndistinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to\nidentify crucial frames and perform propagation.

To bridge\nthis gap, this paper introduces Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT), a\nnovel method adapting Transformer for B-rep learning. B-rep models pose unique\nchallenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric\ndefinitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete\ndata Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous\ngeometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed)\ninto B\\'ezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without\ndiscretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method\nthat organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens\nsuitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological\ncharacteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention\nmechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of\nboundary elements in a B-rep model.

Here, we present\nDynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM\nwith a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or\nre-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and\nreuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving\ninsights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance\nsubstantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth\nlabels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than\ndoubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across\nquestions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to\n99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks\nprone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o\nand Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated\ncode, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic\nchallenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks.\nClaude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro\nproblems.

Specifically, our approach first\nemploys a Transformer-based feature extractor to compute multi-scale patch\nembeddings, capturing both global structural information and local texture\ndetails. The extracted feature embeddings are then fed into an MoE gating\nnetwork, which assigns adaptive weights to multiple diffusion-based denoisers,\neach specializing in different brain MRI characteristics, such as centrum\nsemiovale, sulcal and gyral cortex, and grey-white matter junction. The final\noutput is produced by aggregating the denoised results from these specialized\nexperts according to dynamically assigned gating probabilities. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MoEDiff-SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of quantitative image quality metrics, perceptual fidelity,\nand computational efficiency. Difference maps from each expert further\nhighlight their distinct specializations, confirming the effective\nregion-specific denoising capability and the interpretability of expert\ncontributions.

However, a rigorous evaluation framework for\nvideo CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately\nassess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies\nin perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos\nspanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034\nhigh-quality question-answer pairs.

Furthermore, we design seven\ndistinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT\nprocess based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on\nVCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the\ntop-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7%\naccuracy, while most models score below 40%.

To this end, we propose for the first time a generic\nknowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous\nperspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between\nheterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring\ncross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the\ninfluence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of\nboth the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits\nspace. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous\narchitectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a\nteacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student\nknowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are\nperformed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between\nheterogeneous teacher-student knowledge.

In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes,\ncontrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the\nobservational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as\nnear-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects\nhave been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability\nof stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques\nalongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification\nalgorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along\nwith their diverse observational modes, produces images with different\nproperties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents\na novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star\nfields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object\ndetection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural\nnetworks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the\ntelescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can\ndirectly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields\nwithout requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of\ntraditional techniques.

We address these difficulties\nby proposing a new tubular structure segmentation framework named HarmonySeg.\nFirst, we design a deep-to-shallow decoder network featuring flexible\nconvolution blocks with varying receptive fields, which enables the model to\neffectively adapt to tubular structures of different scales. Second, to\nhighlight potential anatomical regions and improve the recall of small tubular\nstructures, we incorporate vesselness maps as auxiliary information. These maps\nare aligned with image features through a shallow-and-deep fusion module, which\nsimultaneously eliminates unreasonable candidates to maintain high precision.\nFinally, we introduce a topology-preserving loss function that leverages\ncontextual and shape priors to balance the growth and suppression of tubular\nstructures, which also allows the model to handle low-quality and incomplete\nannotations.

However, obtaining paired\nimages in clinical practice is challenging. To address this issue, zero-shot\nself-supervised methods train denoising networks using only the information\nwithin a single image, such as ZS-N2N. However, these methods often employ\ndownsampling operations that degrade image resolution. Additionally, the\ntraining dataset is inherently constrained to the image itself. In this paper,\nwe propose a zero-shot low-dose CT imaging method based on sinogram flicking,\nwhich operates within a single image but generates many copies via random\nconjugate ray matching. Specifically, two conjugate X-ray pencil beams measure\nthe same path; their expected values should be identical, while their noise\nlevels vary during measurements. By randomly swapping portions of the conjugate\nX-rays in the sinogram domain, we generate a large set of sinograms with\nconsistent content but varying noise patterns. When displayed dynamically,\nthese sinograms exhibit a flickering effect due to their identical structural\ncontent but differing noise patterns-hence the term sinogram flicking. We train\nthe network on pairs of sinograms with the same content but different noise\ndistributions using a lightweight model adapted from ZS-NSN. This process is\nrepeated to obtain the final results. A simulation study demonstrates that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as ZS-N2N.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ZS-N2N\uff09\u56e0\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u800c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5171\u8f6d\u5c04\u7ebf\u5339\u914d\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7ec4\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5171\u8f6dX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8eZS-N2N\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u95ea\u70c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
