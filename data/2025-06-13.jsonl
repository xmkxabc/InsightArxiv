To address this, we\nintroduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,\ntraining-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack\ntechniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively\ninjecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our\nexperiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful\nresponse rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four\nbenchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by\nRAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general\ncapabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC.

Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these\ncodes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a\nfundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment\nin communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural\npolar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off\nby simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER\ncharacteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough\nthrough three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture\nthat leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex\ndependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly\noptimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an\nadaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code\n(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for\nrobust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code\nconfiguration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and\nBLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and\nDeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved\narchitecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further\namplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error\nrate metrics over existing approaches.

These methods assume that a model trained on normal\ndata cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this\nassumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or\naccurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for\nanomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly\nsupervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images\ninto the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.\nTo generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly\nrandomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary\ndataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and\nanatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,\nusing both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS\ndataset.

This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,\nblack-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can\nbe highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require\nsignificant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey\nmodification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively\non closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields\nimprovements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on\na range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks.

However, the power\nconsumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of\nreflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power\nconsumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS\nstructure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically\ntunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the\nunique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel\nestimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based\nchannels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation\nscheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity\ninformation, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we\npropose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam\ncoverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase\nshifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel.

Our main results show that for AI systems\nwith expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\\tau$, safety\nverification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the\nCapability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI\ncapability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an\ninescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,\nwe prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system\nexpressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the\npolicy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal\ncoverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural\nnetworks. These results characterize an \"intractability gap\" where practical\nsafety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems.

However, this independence ignores critical\ncomparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of\npointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key\ninnovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise\nRanking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between\neach candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.\nWe strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of\npseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by\ncapturing the global context for document comparison.

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation.

The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets.

However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the\nVision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring\nthe potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical\nimage segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure\nRWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates\nImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical\nimage segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first\npure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a\nlarge-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets\ndemonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation\nperformance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from\nscratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder\nin enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.", "comment": "Preprint Draft, 5 pages.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:\ncontext-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and\nexecution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop\nHeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous\nreasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our\nHeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question\nanswering.

The proposed\nresults have been proved exploiting the regularization and approximation\nproperties of certain Steklov integrals introduced by Sendov and Popov in 1983,\nand differ from the ones given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako. In addition, the\nproof of the original KL approximation theorems were strictly related to the\napplication of certain classical results of the trigonometric best\napproximation, and thus, they are applicable only for operators of the\ntrigonometric type. By the definition of semi-discrete moduli of smoothness\nhere proposed, we are able to deduce applications also for operators that are\nnot necessarily of the trigonometric type, and can also be used to derive\nsharper estimates than those that can be achieved by the classical averaged\nmoduli of smoothness ($\\tau$-moduli). Furthermore, a Rathore-type theorem is\nestablished, and a new notion of K-functional is also introduced showing its\nequivalence with the semi-discrete modulus of smoothness and its realization.\nOne-sided estimates of approximation can be established for classical operators\non bounded domains, such as the Bernstein polynomials. In the case of\napproximation operators on the whole real line, one-sided estimates can be\nachieved, e.g., for the Shannon sampling (cardinal) series, as well as for the\nso-called generalized sampling operators.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision.

Our framework first estimates task difficulty using\nChain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into\nthree difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed\ndifficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best\nmodel for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental\nresults show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score\nwhile reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method\nComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an\napproximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of\ncost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides\nmore reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical\nchallenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model\nheterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address\nthese issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and\nrobust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to\nsimultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC\nintroduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized\nlocal AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through\nbidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global\nknowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus\nsupporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance\nrobustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning\nAggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based\non parameter deviations during server-side aggregation. Extensive experiments\non four diverse audio classification benchmarks, spanning both speech and\nnon-speech tasks, demonstrate that FedMLAC consistently outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to\nnoisy data.", "comment": "initial version", "cate": "cs.SD", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10207v1"}

Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token.

Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors.

Current HR estimation methods, categorized into\nphysiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency\nand interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based\nneural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake\n(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and\ntested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities\nincluding resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological\nconstraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement\nphysiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN\nmodel adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation\naccuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative\nstatistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par\nwith the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming\ntraditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at\nidentifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate\nreasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation\nsystem derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of\npersonalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical\nactivities.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10144v1"}

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired\nmusic and dance data, which restricts the model\\^a\\u{A}\\'Zs ability to learn\ndiverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "comment": "check demos at https://dancechat.github.io/anon/", "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574v1"}

While self-training methods have proven effective in\nsemi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo\nlabels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification\nproblem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or\ninvolve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the\npersistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource\nlinguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy\npseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This\ncomponent specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an\ninitial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an\nadaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial\nfor mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,\nallowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a\nhandful of true labels.

In this\nwork, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework\nthat overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated\nexpert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an\nagentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores\npossible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically\ntailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data\nscience benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance\nversus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable\neffectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting\nAutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.", "comment": "Ongoing work.

Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

Recent developments have\ngiven rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,\nthat achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural\nquestion: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that\nsupport near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space\nsequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization\nunifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)\nand linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new\nmodels with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per\ntoken and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such\nmodels on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic\ntasks, including state tracking and associative recall.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline.

GenWorld features the\nfollowing characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on\nvideos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due\nto their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs\nmultiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and\nhigh-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes\nvideos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,\ntext, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable\nforensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect\nhigh-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing\npotential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a\nsimple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency\nas a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments\nshow that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising\ndirection for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical\nplausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated\nvideo detection.

Thus, we propose an\nAttentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident\nvideo clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal\nclips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on\naccident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content\nof frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using\ndatasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.\nAdditionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant\ntriple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated\npair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips.

In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it\ngeneralizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the\nmodel architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new\npossibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps\nfor practical applications.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.GR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027v1"}

Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention\nwhile maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive\nexperiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate\nthat GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective\nunlearning.

Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated.

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.

For\nexample, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute\npoints by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect\nlabel), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the\n29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work\nfor Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or\nOLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual\ncode execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes\nsignificantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with\nspurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward\nsignal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned\nduring pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future\nwork. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on\ndiverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy\nto get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely\nspurious reward signals.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.AI", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10947v1"}

Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)\nloss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when\nusing the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy\nLV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the\nlog-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward\nprocesses, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when\ndiffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for\ndiffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that\ncan be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our\nanalysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick\n(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently\noutperforms the LV loss.

When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D.
