To enhance the\nsecurity and trust for TLS 1.3 in such scenarios, we propose LURK-T, a provably\nsecure framework which allows for limited use of remote keys with added trust\nin TLS 1.3. We efficiently decouple the server side of TLS 1.3 into a LURK-T\nCrypto Service (CS) and a LURK-T Engine (E). CS executes all cryptographic\noperations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), upon E's requests. CS and\nE together provide the whole TLS-server functionality. A major benefit of our\nconstruction is that it is application agnostic; the LURK-T Crypto Service\ncould be collocated with the LURK-T Engine, or it could run on different\nmachines. Thus, our design allows for in situ attestation and protection of the\ncryptographic side of the TLS server, as well as for all setups of CDNs over\nTLS. To support such a generic decoupling, we provide a full Application\nProgramming Interface (API) for LURK-T. To this end, we implement our LURK-T\nCrypto Service using Intel SGX and integrate it with OpenSSL. We also test\nLURK-T's efficiency and show that, from a TLS-client's perspective, HTTPS\nservers using LURK-T instead a traditional TLS-server have no noticeable\noverhead when serving files greater than 1MB. In addition, we provide\ncryptographic proofs and formal security verification using ProVerif.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12026v1"}

Microring modulators\n(MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy\nefficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division\nmultiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200\nGb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order\ncoherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16).\n  In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used\nto implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks\nof a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify\ncarrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate\nthe performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters\nusing a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an\ninput-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension.\nThrough full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design\nachieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65\ndBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite\nusing 10-100x less area.

We further demonstrate new model capabilities in\nMRI such as classification of image properties including body location,\nsequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation.

This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under\nloose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal\ndependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time\nperformance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image\nquality and temporal coherence.

Multiple-row activation is fundamentally different from\nconventional memory access patterns that activate one DRAM row at a time.\nHowever, repeatedly activating even one DRAM row (e.g., RowHammer) can induce\nbitflips in unaccessed DRAM rows because modern DRAM is subject to read\ndisturbance. Unfortunately, no prior work investigates the effects of\nmultiple-row activation on DRAM read disturbance.\n  In this paper, we present the first characterization study of read\ndisturbance effects of multiple-row activation-based PuD (which we call\nPuDHammer) using 316 real DDR4 DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers.\nOur detailed characterization show that 1) PuDHammer significantly exacerbates\nthe read disturbance vulnerability, causing up to 158.58x reduction in the\nminimum hammer count required to induce the first bitflip ($HC_{first}$),\ncompared to RowHammer, 2) PuDHammer is affected by various operational\nconditions and parameters, 3) combining RowHammer with PuDHammer is more\neffective than using RowHammer alone to induce read disturbance error, e.g.,\ndoing so reduces $HC_{first}$ by 1.66x on average, and 4) PuDHammer bypasses an\nin-DRAM RowHammer mitigation mechanism (Target Row Refresh) and induces more\nbitflips than RowHammer.\n  To develop future robust PuD-enabled systems in the presence of PuDHammer, we\n1) develop three countermeasures and 2) adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art\nRowHammer mitigation standardized by industry, called Per Row Activation\nCounting (PRAC).

This paper seeks to investigate this\nsubject with the objective of appreciating not whom to trust but what are the\ncircumstances where the direct paradigm of control design from any lightly\nqualified data set provides a sensible way forward.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nmulti-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \\textbf{ViSTA}.\nIt consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant\nhistory features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the\nextracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection\nstrategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is\nselected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to\nemploy a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image\nalignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable\nassessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV\ndataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different\nframes, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12198v1"}

Online processes often\nexhibit complex structures that reflect the nature of the user behavior,\nwhether it is authentic and genuine, or part of a coordinated effort by\nmalicious agents to spread misinformation and disinformation. Detection of\nAI-generated content can be extremely challenging due to the high quality of\nlarge language model-generated text.

However, since extreme overlaps are rare in\nnatural conversations, this degradation cannot be overlooked. This paper first\nreveals that the degradation is caused by the global-statistics-based modules,\nwidely used in speaker embedding extractors, being overly sensitive to\nintervals containing only non-target speakers. As a countermeasure, we propose\nan extension of such modules that exploit the target speaker activity clues, to\ncompute statistics from intervals where the target is active. The proposed\nmethod improves speaker verification performance in both low and high overlap\nratios, and diarization performance on multiple datasets.", "comment": "Accepted to Interspeech 2025", "cate": "eess.AS", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12500v1"}

A formulation for\nactive dendrites using the notational language of conventional machine learning\nis put forward as an alternative to a spiking neuron formulation. Based on this\nformulation, neuromorphic dendrites are developed as basic neural building\nblocks capable of dynamic online clustering. Features and capabilities of\nneuromorphic dendrites are demonstrated via a benchmark drawn from experimental\nneuroscience: spike sorting. Spike sorting takes inputs from electrical probes\nimplanted in neural tissue, detects voltage spikes (action potentials) emitted\nby neurons, and attempts to sort the spikes according to the neuron that\nemitted them. Many spike sorting methods form clusters based on the shapes of\naction potential waveforms, under the assumption that spikes emitted by a given\nneuron have similar shapes and will therefore map to the same cluster. Using a\nstream of synthetic spike shapes, the accuracy of the proposed dendrite is\ncompared with the more compute-intensive, offline k-means clustering approach.\nOverall, the dendrite outperforms k-means and has the advantage of requiring\nonly a single pass through the input stream, learning as it goes.

To handle the\nformulated non-convex problem, a gradient-based meta-learning joint\noptimization (GML-JO) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the original problem\nis initially decomposed into two sub-problems of beamforming optimization and\nantenna position optimization through equivalent substitution. Then, the convex\napproximation methods are used to deal with the nonconvex constraints of\nsub-problems, and two sub-neural networks are constructed to calculate the\nsub-problems separately. Different from alternating optimization (AO), where\ntwo sub-problems are solved alternately and the solutions are influenced by the\ninitial values, two sub-neural networks of proposed GML-JO with fixed channel\ncoefficients are considered as local sub-tasks and the computation results are\nused to calculate the loss function of joint optimization. Finally, the\nparameters of sub-networks are updated using the average loss function over\ndifferent sub-tasks and the solution that is robust to the initial value is\nobtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GML-JO algorithm\nachieves 5.6 bits/s/Hz WSR within 100 iterations, yielding a 32.7\\% performance\nenhancement over conventional AO with substantially reduced computational\ncomplexity.

In response, the community has introduced\ndedicated benchmarks and tailored detection strategies. As the field advances,\nefforts have moved beyond binary detection toward source attribution, including\nopen-set attribution, which aims to identify the NAC responsible for generation\nand flag novel, unseen ones during inference. This shift toward source\nattribution improves forensic interpretability and accountability. However,\nopen-set attribution remains fundamentally limited: while it can detect that a\nNAC is unfamiliar, it cannot characterize or identify individual unseen codecs.\nIt treats such inputs as generic ``unknowns'', lacking insight into their\ninternal configuration. This leads to major shortcomings: limited\ngeneralization to new NACs and inability to resolve fine-grained variations\nwithin NAC families. To address these gaps, we propose Neural Audio Codec\nSource Parsing (NACSP) - a paradigm shift that reframes source attribution for\nCFs as structured regression over generative NAC parameters such as quantizers,\nbandwidth, and sampling rate.

We explore the\narchitectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific\nadaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,\nbusiness, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the\nsignificant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and\nethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,\nintellectual property, and accessibility.

While recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of\nautomated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction\nerrors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied\nscientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this\ngap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two\nlevels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP\nevaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level\ngraph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and\nconnectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on\naffiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social\nregister books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where\nbiases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero.

However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume\nshift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to\ninconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of\nacoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic\nConvolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based\non the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance.\nFDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting\nmultiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights.\nExperimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance\non the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv\nhas limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all\nfrequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the $3\\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient\nto capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study\nintroduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv)\napplies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the\nreceptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature\nrepresentation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by\n9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high\ncomputational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution\noperations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary\nadaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D\nconvolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv\nimproves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of\nparameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv)\nextends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same\ndilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels\nwith different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse\nfrequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv\nachieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by\n10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which\nassigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to\neffectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes\nTAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that\nfocuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes\ntransient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary\nproperties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces\nthe number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M),\nachieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise\nperformance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary\nevents, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral\nfeatures, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events.\nAdditionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting\ntransient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable\nsignal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide\nharmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD\nconv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc\ndetection.

While this shift aligns\ntraining more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on\nin-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives.

To address this, we propose a Hierarchical\nGroup-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual\nvector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that\npartition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply\nlistwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy,\nwhere shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly\nsimilar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively\nharder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure\ntend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these\nhierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative\nmining.

This yields a\nnormalized circularity index between 0 (fully acyclic) and 1 (for networks\nformed solely by the superposition of cycles), with the complement measuring\ndirectionality. This index captures the proportion of flow involved in cycles,\nand admits a range of interpretations - such as system closure, feedback,\nweighted strong connectivity, structural redundancy, or inefficiency. Although\nthe decomposition is generally non-unique, we show that the set of all\ndecompositions forms a well-structured geometric space with favourable\ntopological properties. Within this space, we highlight two benchmark\ndecompositions aligned with distinct analytical goals: the maximum circularity\nsolution, which minimizes nett flow, and the Balanced Flow Forwarding (BFF)\nsolution, a unique, locally computable decomposition that distributes circular\nflow across all feasible cycles in proportion to the original network\nstructure. We demonstrate the interpretive value and computational tractability\nof both decompositions on synthetic and empirical networks.

While effective, MAR models\nsuffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and\nfeed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite\nmost tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a\ntraining-free generation framework MARch\\'e to address this inefficiency\nthrough two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh.\nCache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling\nseparate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed\nkey/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached\ntoken cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing\ncontextual information over multiple steps. MARch\\'e recognizes this challenge\nand applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh\nidentifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly\ngenerated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation,\nwhile preserving image generation quality. MARch\\'e significantly reduces\nredundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture.\nEmpirically, MARch\\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on\nimage quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for\nefficient masked transformer generation.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12035v1"}

Streaming processing and resource efficiency\nare crucial requirements for counting triangles in modern massive temporal\ngraphs, with millions of nodes and up to billions of temporal edges. However,\ncurrent exact and approximate algorithms are unable to handle large-scale\ntemporal graphs. To fill such a gap, we introduce STEP, a scalable and\nefficient algorithm to approximate temporal triangle counts from a stream of\ntemporal edges. STEP combines predictions to the number of triangles a temporal\nedge is involved in, with a simple sampling strategy, leading to scalability,\nefficiency, and accurate approximation of all eight temporal triangle types\nsimultaneously.

While proprietary models\nlike GPT-4o achieve high benchmarks scores on SWE-bench, their API dependence,\ncost, and privacy concerns limit adoption. Open-source alternatives offer\ntransparency but underperform in complex tasks, especially sub-100B parameter\nmodels. Although quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data can enhance reasoning,\ncurrent methods face two critical flaws: (1) weak rejection sampling reduces\ndata quality, and (2) inadequate step validation causes error accumulation.\nThese limitations lead to flawed reasoning chains that impair LLMs'ability to\nlearn reliable issue resolution. The paper proposes MCTS-REFINE, an enhanced\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithm that dynamically validates and\noptimizes intermediate reasoning steps through a rigorous rejection sampling\nstrategy, generating high-quality CoT data to improve LLM performance in issue\nresolution tasks. Key innovations include: (1) augmenting MCTS with a\nreflection mechanism that corrects errors via rejection sampling and\nrefinement, (2) decomposing issue resolution into three subtasks-File\nLocalization, Fault Localization, and Patch Generation-each with clear\nground-truth criteria, and (3) enforcing a strict sampling protocol where\nintermediate outputs must exactly match verified developer patches, ensuring\ncorrectness across reasoning paths.

State-of-the-art quantum\ncircuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and\neven exponential, time. Recent work proposed a new approach that pursues a\nweaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural\nnumber $\\Omega$, local optimality insists that each and every $\\Omega$-segment\nof the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the\noracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls\nto the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to\noracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential.\n  In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of\nquantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set\nof fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a $\\Omega$-deep\ncircuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in\nrounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the\nsegments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the\ninvariant. For constant $\\Omega$, we prove that the algorithm requires\n$O(n\\lg{n})$ work and $O(r\\lg{n})$ span, where $n$ is the circuit size and $r$\nis the number of rounds.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

We characterize such impacts in healthcare,\nusing electronic health records of over 5M patients across primary care\npractices in all 50 states. Our contributions are threefold.

We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking\nkey events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires\nreasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small\nmodels like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as\nClaude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another\nLLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection\nand classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:\nfor instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal\ndynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When\nanalyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual\nframing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors\nstep-by-step causal reasoning.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

{"id": "2506.12742", "title": "Physics-informed Neural Motion Planning via Domain Decomposition in Large Environments", "authors": ["Yuchen Liu", "Alexiy Buynitsky", "Ruiqi Ni", "Ahmed H. Qureshi"], "summary": "Physics-informed Neural Motion Planners (PiNMPs) provide a data-efficient\nframework for solving the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and\nrepresenting the cost-to-go function for motion planning. However, their\nscalability remains limited by spectral bias and the complex loss landscape of\nPDE-driven training. Domain decomposition mitigates these issues by dividing\nthe environment into smaller subdomains, but existing methods enforce\ncontinuity only at individual spatial points. While effective for function\napproximation, these methods fail to capture the spatial connectivity required\nfor motion planning, where the cost-to-go function depends on both the start\nand goal coordinates rather than a single query point. We propose Finite Basis\nNeural Time Fields (FB-NTFields), a novel neural field representation for\nscalable cost-to-go estimation. Instead of enforcing continuity in output\nspace, FB-NTFields construct a latent space representation, computing the\ncost-to-go as a distance between the latent embeddings of start and goal\ncoordinates. This enables global spatial coherence while integrating domain\ndecomposition, ensuring efficient large-scale motion planning. We validate\nFB-NTFields in complex synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements over existing PiNMPs. Finally, we deploy our method on\na Unitree B1 quadruped robot, successfully navigating indoor environments.

Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone\nto epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the\nconcept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic\ncomputational framework that integrates formal automata theory with\nblockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and\nreasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain,\nrendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access\nand confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges\ncontextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic\naccess control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is\nconstrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic\ntraversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and\nhistoried, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting.\nZero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion\nattestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache\nbut as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by\ncryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent\nagent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably\nderived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design\nlays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance\ncomputational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and\nstructural truth.", "comment": "47 pages, includes formal automata specifications, cryptographic\n  constructions, and epistemic architecture schema", "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13246v1"}

For smooth\nvelocity fields $\\bm u$ in two dimensions, we explicitly construct a finite\ndifference method (FDM) with sixth-order consistency to approximate $\\bm u$ at\nall relevant grid points: interior points, boundary side points, and boundary\ncorner points.

Traditional ReID methods assume\nthat the training and test domains share similar characteristics and primarily\nfocus on learning discriminative features within a given domain. However, they\noften fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by\nvariations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this\nissue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These\napproaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve\nperformance by aligning feature distributions between source and target\ndomains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and\nchallenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without\nrelying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various\nstrategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field\nremains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nsurvey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID\nincluding the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source\ninput configurations. Then, we categorize and analyze domain generalization\nmodules that explicitly aim to learn domain-invariant and\nidentity-discriminative representations. To examine the broader applicability\nof these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that\nalso involves distribution shifts.

In response, the community has introduced\ndedicated benchmarks and tailored detection strategies. As the field advances,\nefforts have moved beyond binary detection toward source attribution, including\nopen-set attribution, which aims to identify the NAC responsible for generation\nand flag novel, unseen ones during inference. This shift toward source\nattribution improves forensic interpretability and accountability. However,\nopen-set attribution remains fundamentally limited: while it can detect that a\nNAC is unfamiliar, it cannot characterize or identify individual unseen codecs.\nIt treats such inputs as generic ``unknowns'', lacking insight into their\ninternal configuration. This leads to major shortcomings: limited\ngeneralization to new NACs and inability to resolve fine-grained variations\nwithin NAC families. To address these gaps, we propose Neural Audio Codec\nSource Parsing (NACSP) - a paradigm shift that reframes source attribution for\nCFs as structured regression over generative NAC parameters such as quantizers,\nbandwidth, and sampling rate. We formulate NACSP as a multi-task regression\ntask for predicting these NAC parameters and establish the first comprehensive\nbenchmark using various state-of-the-art speech pre-trained models (PTMs). To\nthis end, we propose HYDRA, a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic\ngeometry to disentangle complex latent properties from PTM representations.

{"id": "2506.12785", "title": "Frequency Dynamic Convolutions for Sound Event Detection", "authors": ["Hyeonuk Nam"], "summary": "Recent research in deep learning-based Sound Event Detection (SED) has\nprimarily focused on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) and\nTransformer models. However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume\nshift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to\ninconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of\nacoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic\nConvolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based\non the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance.\nFDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting\nmultiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights.\nExperimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance\non the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv\nhas limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all\nfrequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the $3\\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient\nto capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study\nintroduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv)\napplies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the\nreceptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature\nrepresentation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by\n9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high\ncomputational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution\noperations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary\nadaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D\nconvolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv\nimproves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of\nparameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv)\nextends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same\ndilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels\nwith different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse\nfrequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv\nachieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by\n10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which\nassigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to\neffectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes\nTAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that\nfocuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes\ntransient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary\nproperties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces\nthe number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M),\nachieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise\nperformance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary\nevents, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral\nfeatures, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events.\nAdditionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting\ntransient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable\nsignal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide\nharmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD\nconv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc\ndetection.

Schuller", "Xiaoshuai Hao"], "summary": "In recent years, complexity compression of neural network (NN)-based speech\nenhancement (SE) models has gradually attracted the attention of researchers,\nespecially in scenarios with limited hardware resources or strict latency\nrequirements. The main difficulties and challenges lie in achieving a balance\nbetween complexity and performance according to the characteristics of the\ntask. In this paper, we propose an intra-inter set knowledge distillation (KD)\nframework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$S-TFCKD) for SE. Different from\nprevious distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes\nthe time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global\nknowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation\nbased on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the\nteacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency\ndomains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined\nallocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to\nspeech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation\nparadigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set,\nmulti-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated\ndistillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each\ncorrelated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that\nenables inter-set knowledge interaction. The proposed distillation strategy is\napplied to the dual-path dilated convolutional recurrent network (DPDCRN) that\nranked first in the SE track of the L3DAS23 challenge. Objective evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed KD strategy consistently and effectively improves\nthe performance of the low-complexity student model and outperforms other\ndistillation schemes.", "comment": "submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning\n  Systems", "cate": "cs.SD", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13127v1"}

These platforms provide designers with\naccess to manufacturing resources through a network of suppliers and have\ninstant order placement capabilities. Two key decision making levers are\ntypically used to optimize the operations of these marketplaces: pricing and\nmatching. The existing marketplaces operate in a centralized structure where\nthey have complete control over decision making. However, a decentralized\norganization of the platform enables transparency of information across clients\nand suppliers. This dissertation focuses on developing tools for decision\nmaking enabling decentralization in MaaS marketplaces. In pricing mechanisms, a\ndata driven method is introduced which enables small service providers to price\nservices based on specific attributes of the services offered. A data mining\nmethod recommends a network based price to a supplier based on its attributes\nand the attributes of other suppliers on the platform. Three different\napproaches are considered for matching mechanisms. First, a reverse auction\nmechanism is introduced where designers bid for manufacturing services and the\nmechanism chooses a supplier which can match the bid requirements and stated\nprice. The second approach uses mechanism design and mathematical programming\nto develop a stable matching mechanism for matching orders to suppliers based\non their preferences. Empirical simulations are used to test the mechanisms in\na simulated 3D printing marketplace and to evaluate the impact of stability on\nits performance. The third approach considers the matching problem in a dynamic\nand stochastic environment where demand (orders) and supply (supplier\ncapacities) arrive over time and matching is performed online.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.AI", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12730v1"}

Performance is\nbenchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating\nsuperior win rates ($58.5\\% \\pm 1.0\\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM\ncounterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement\nlearning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in\nlearning implicit strategies from self-play.

While numerous works have explored factors influencing model\nmemorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains\nunderexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the\nPythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix\nperturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data\ncharacteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings\nreveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally\nwhile efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of\nnew memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting\nincreases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and\nuncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and\n(4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation\nuncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy\nsamples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional\nrobustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization\nmechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy\nsafeguards, and architectural improvements.", "comment": "5 figures", "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12321v1"}

However, poor implementation\npractices can lead to unintended consequences, particularly in socioeconomic\ncontexts where externalities (costs or benefits to third parties outside the\noptimization process) are significant. To propose solutions, it is crucial to\nfirst characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar\npractices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected\nstakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes.\nAlso, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond\ntraditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities\nbut fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and\nfeedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking\nwith the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This\napproach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or\nwhere) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities,\nalong with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying \"who\nwas affected and how\" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems\nthinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex\nsystems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking\ncontributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities,\nfeedback loops, and determining \"when\" to incorporate them in the optimization.\nTogether, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing\noptimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with\nnormative objectives. Using this, we examine three common types of subpar\npractices: ignorance, error, and prioritization of short-term goals.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.AI", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12825v1"}

To solve this problem, we\npropose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We\nuse a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of\nthe hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB\nimages and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to\ngenerate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a\ndouble check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain\nrobust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand\nrefinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases\nthe flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task.

This approach is motivated by the observation that\nwhile scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across\ntask instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they\ncan generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy.

To support our position, we outline key\nprinciples for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style\nmodality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality\nchanges the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations\ncapture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified\nstability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal\nperturbations).

Performing a PuD operation involves activating\nmultiple DRAM rows in quick succession or simultaneously, i.e., multiple-row\nactivation. Multiple-row activation is fundamentally different from\nconventional memory access patterns that activate one DRAM row at a time.\nHowever, repeatedly activating even one DRAM row (e.g., RowHammer) can induce\nbitflips in unaccessed DRAM rows because modern DRAM is subject to read\ndisturbance. Unfortunately, no prior work investigates the effects of\nmultiple-row activation on DRAM read disturbance.\n  In this paper, we present the first characterization study of read\ndisturbance effects of multiple-row activation-based PuD (which we call\nPuDHammer) using 316 real DDR4 DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers.\nOur detailed characterization show that 1) PuDHammer significantly exacerbates\nthe read disturbance vulnerability, causing up to 158.58x reduction in the\nminimum hammer count required to induce the first bitflip ($HC_{first}$),\ncompared to RowHammer, 2) PuDHammer is affected by various operational\nconditions and parameters, 3) combining RowHammer with PuDHammer is more\neffective than using RowHammer alone to induce read disturbance error, e.g.,\ndoing so reduces $HC_{first}$ by 1.66x on average, and 4) PuDHammer bypasses an\nin-DRAM RowHammer mitigation mechanism (Target Row Refresh) and induces more\nbitflips than RowHammer.\n  To develop future robust PuD-enabled systems in the presence of PuDHammer, we\n1) develop three countermeasures and 2) adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art\nRowHammer mitigation standardized by industry, called Per Row Activation\nCounting (PRAC).

However, unlike\nmany new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the\ngeneral/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for\nevaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To\naddress this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly\nevaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined\nuser personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to\ninfer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback\ndecouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the\nmodel's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas.\nPersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are\ncategorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual\ncomplexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle\ndifferences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive\nevaluations across a wide range of models.

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical\nexamples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility\nspecifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is\nleft without principled guidance to justify any particular specification.

This overlooks\ncrucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little\nto item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify\ntoken decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation\nas a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain\n(IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our\nempirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to\nhigh logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which\nmay impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an\nInformation Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that\nintegrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding.

HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout\nthe video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process\nseparately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage\ntraining strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model\ndecoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby\naccelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation.

To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,\nan innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and\nharmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.\nSpecifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and\nRoberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,\nrespectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to\nproduce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch\ndeformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility\nmaps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an\narea-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and\neffectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors\nfor visibility-aware patch deformation.

However, existing methods\nstruggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under\nbroad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute\na dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image\nposes and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method\nis evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The\nmethod consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm\ncompared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.\nFurthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully\nautomatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient\nsolution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which\ncan be easily combined with tracking systems.

However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is\nessential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well\nas the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing\nexplainable and interpretable composite indicators using \"if..., then...\"\ndecision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of\ncomposite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical\nscores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal\nqualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into\nquantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in\nthe form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is\nconstructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units\nresults from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision\nrules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the\nDominance-based Rough Set Approach.

Specifically, we prove that any\ntransformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only\n$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \\ll N$, and that this cannot be\nimproved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural\nscenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention\nsinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12220v1"}

This framework\nemploys a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the\ninterconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external\nfactual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination\nwithin a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking\ndatasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated\nthe proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs\non HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7\ntypical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2)\ngeneralizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with\nthree representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

Previous approaches\ncan be grouped into two primary \"meta-learner\" paradigms that impose distinct\ninductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate\npotential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their\ndifference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize\nestimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently\noutperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when\nthe PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is\nsimpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid\nLearner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between\nthe direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The\nH-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference\nclosely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual\napproximations of the POs themselves.

Through\ndetailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other\nreflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in\nself-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias.

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the\nnaive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather\nthe opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action\nas independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and\nmaking typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy.

However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D\ndental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.\nDuring the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's\nhead, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward\nprojections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the\nnetwork to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts\nin the reconstructed images.

First, device-edge-cloud\nframework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,\nand cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model\ninference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to\na series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling\neffective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource\nconstraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based\nintelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging\ncommunication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI\nmodels across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses\nthe capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced\nintelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI\nservices, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and\ncommunication systems.", "comment": "Authors are with Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China\n  Telecom, China.

Our approach relies on simulating Post\nmachines, a Turing-complete computational model. Post machines can be modeled\nas automata equipped with a queue, exhibiting computational behaviors naturally\naligned with those of transformers.

Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and\nreproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed\npapers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to\nevolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,\ncomputational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting\nsignificant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing\nresearch suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on\nsimple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the\ncredibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like\nBalanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results\nis emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the\nevolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship\nattribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin\nDesprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the\nopportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve\ndisputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable\nguidelines for future research are proposed.

Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this\nlimitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,\nunderscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this\nwork, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding\nframework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic\nsequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their\nembeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we\nintroduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns\nembedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a\nknowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position\nembeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing\nextrapolation performance.

In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de\nfacto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically\nthis term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a\ncorrelation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in\nevery case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must\nbe carefully tuned.

To address this gap, this paper\nproposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task\nlearning approach for enhancing financial RE.

Moreover, this work employs a\nsentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate\nthe reasoning process.

Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit\ncorrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be\ncostly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does\nnot always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can\ndirectly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities\nwith ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with\nin-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.\nThe key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally\ncorrespond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an\nexpert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of\ncollecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our\nmethod: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current\nobservations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training\nobservations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence\nfeedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD\nobservations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform\ndeployment-time generalization.

To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning\n(Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between\nincomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations\nin MTS.

The\nlatter improves the student model's robustness by learning from\npositive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with\ndifferent missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing\nrates.

Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone.

In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations.

Kevin Zhou"], "summary": "The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability\nvia linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and\nlife-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM\nmethods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain\nthe model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of\nconcept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated\nwith the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a\nblind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and\nthus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,\nimpairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nMulti-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),\nwhich comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference\nmodeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with\nfeatures at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse\nactivation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple\nlayers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept\npreferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual\ninformation to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model\ndecisions.

It integrates 384 Ascend 910C\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose\nCloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core\ninnovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales\nprefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy\nsupporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware\noptimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and\nINT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows\nCloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of\n6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms\nTPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s\neven under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization\nmaintains model accuracy across benchmarks.", "comment": "59 pages, 24 figures", "cate": "cs.DC", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12708v1"}

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced.

They are widely used\nnowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving\nadvancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work,\nwe focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which\nwe refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which\nboth inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly\nsuitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached\nbinary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the\nAlchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key\ninsights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary\nANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically\nrepresented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of\nmodifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a\ngradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,\nthe training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set\ntransitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief\nchange. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we\nshow that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,\ngradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known\nshortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training\ndynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style\nchange operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --\nthat align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.AI", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13157v1"}

This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically.

To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration.

Overall, our findings show\nthat Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with\nhigher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy,\nwhereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13746v1"}

This assumption confines prior work to\nquasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by\nhumanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature,\nwe start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language,\nclosed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10\ncategories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot\nBehavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid\nvision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language\npolicy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic\ndemonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes\nthese latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark,\nLeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation\ntasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical\nwhole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.RO", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13751v1"}
{"id": "2506.13752", "title": "Steering LLM Thinking with Budget Guidance", "authors": ["Junyan Li", "Wenshuo Zhao", "Yang Zhang", "Chuang Gan"], "summary": "Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to\nimprove performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it\nincurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains.\nControlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore\nimportant, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We\npropose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the\nreasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM\nfine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a\nGamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token\ngeneration. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level\nmanner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified\nthinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking\nlength, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline\nmethods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26%\naccuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to\nbaseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the\nthinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also\ngeneralizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as\nestimating question difficulty.

Unlike existing\nmethods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse\nproblems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks\nunder a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast\nPDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward\nprediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states\nfrom initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based\narchitecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer\nmissing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video\ndiffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,\nwhile enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.\nExtensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model\noffers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and\nproblem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "comment": "Submitted to NeurIPS 2025.

This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,\nfine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.\nThese capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.\nRecently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as\na large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance\ncomparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x\nacceleration in inference speed.\n  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven\nby progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs\nand MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and\nfoundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing\ndomain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete\ndiffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and\ndMLLMs research in early 2025.\n  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM\nand dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs,\nformalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative\nmodels. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and\nsummarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and\nbiological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research\nand deployment.\n  Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13759v1"}

In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss\nvalue for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the\noptimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,\nand develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant\nscalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this\ntool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of\nmainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training\nschedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B\nparameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting\nthe optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled\nsetting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.", "comment": "29 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.
