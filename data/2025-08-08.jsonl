A multi-agentic component processes maintenance\nmanuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web\nsearches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date\nmaintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations.

Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we\nintroduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific\nattention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost\nconfidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset.

To\naddress these challenges, this paper studies multi-robot coordination and\nproposes APEX-MR, an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed to\nsafely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve cooperative\nassembly, e.g., LEGO assembly. In particular, APEX-MR provides a systematic\napproach to post-process multi-robot tasks and motion plans to enable robust\nasynchronous execution under uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that\nAPEX-MR can significantly speed up the execution time of many long-horizon LEGO\nassembly tasks by 48% compared to sequential planning and 36% compared to\nsynchronous planning on average. To further demonstrate performance, we deploy\nAPEX-MR in a dual-arm system to perform physical LEGO assembly. To our\nknowledge, this is the first robotic system capable of performing customized\nLEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the dual-arm system, with APEX-MR, can safely coordinate robot\nmotions, efficiently collaborate, and construct complex LEGO structures.

While the RTF vector of the first source can be\nestimated straightforwardly, the main challenge arises in estimating the RTF\nvectors of subsequent sources during segments where multiple sources are\nsimultaneously active. The blind oblique projection (BOP) method has been\nproposed to estimate the RTF vector of a newly activating source by optimally\nblocking this source.
