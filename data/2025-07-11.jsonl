Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European\nRobotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly\nreduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to\nstate-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These\nresults highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in\nimproving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational\noverhead.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

To\nclose the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the\ngeneration of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,\ngenerating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,\nposes a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,\nsafety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which\nsignals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC\nsystem, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already\nestablished as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory\nepilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements\nor specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the\neffect of such treatments are mostly unknown.

In this paper, we propose to leverage personal\nhealth data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile\nand robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones.

While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05).

When ML methods are responsible for making\ncritical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these\ndecisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution,\noffering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to\ntransition from one decision to another.

Therefore, the question of\nwhether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate\ndownstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction\nof principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in\nthe sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners\nfrom corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic\nRobust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures\nthat minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first\ninstantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber\nestimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness\nresult on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering\nprocedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a\nheterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared\nto the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.\nWe explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem\nparameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,\nobserving statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the\ntrade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)\nprefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP\nfor large datasets.", "comment": "Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on DataWorld: Unifying Data Curation\n  Frameworks Across Domains", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20573v3", "cate": "stat.ML", "date": "2025-06-25", "updated": "2025-07-10"}
