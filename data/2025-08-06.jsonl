This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass.

The various backends capture\ncycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns\nwith StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and\nproject performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design\nconsideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic\nexploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and\nefficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads\nreveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic\narray scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for\nhigh-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions\nachieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform\nSRAM hierarchies.

To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.", "comment": "Accepted to NeSy 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03366v1", "cate": "cs.AI", "date": "2025-08-05", "updated": "2025-08-05"}

We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new\nperspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into:\nhigh-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and\nlow-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a\nprogressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the\nmost conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for\nHVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify\nand eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the\npatched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The\nlocalized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs,\nwhich globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned\ninput as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally\ntreat the benign features as \"noise\". This formulation allows us to reconstruct\nSVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign \"noise\"\nfeatures. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed\ntrigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we\nintroduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM\nto restore any collateral impact on clean features.

Thus, the collective prices of all related\noutcomes should be \\$1, representing a combined probability of 1 of any\noutcome. Despite this design, Polymarket exhibits cases where dependent assets\nare mispriced, allowing for purchasing (or selling) a certain outcome for less\nthan (or more than) \\$1, guaranteeing profit. This phenomenon, known as\narbitrage, could enable sophisticated participants to exploit such\ninconsistencies.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical arbitrage analysis on Polymarket data\nto answer three key questions: (Q1) What conditions give rise to arbitrage (Q2)\nDoes arbitrage actually occur on Polymarket and (Q3) Has anyone exploited these\nopportunities. A major challenge in analyzing arbitrage between related markets\nlies in the scalability of comparisons across a large number of markets and\nconditions, with a naive analysis requiring $O(2^{n+m})$ comparisons.

On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models.

VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a\nhuman-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking\nalgorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple\nvideo sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that\nhierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and\n3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this\nhierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our\napproach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental\nresults demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning\ntasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior\nanalysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly\noutperforming existing methods.

Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA).

Generally, only one relation has been\nconsidered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure\nhumans' performance on the same task as that performed by the PLMs. This means\nthat at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of the extent of\nthese models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy,\nnamely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use five\nmetrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic\nrelation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, prototypicality,\nand distinguishability. Using these, we can fairly compare humans and models on\nthe same task. Our extensive experiments involve six PLMs, four masked and two\ncausal language models.

In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired\nwith 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality\nbare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nthat focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that\nFFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets\nand serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.", "comment": "Project: https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page, Datasets:\n  https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/FFHQ-Makeup", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03241v1", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-08-05", "updated": "2025-08-05"}

Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in\nthe engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates.\nIn this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam\nlattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical\nproblem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By\napplying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of\nequations in the frequency domain. As the lattice size approaches zero, this\nyields a homogenized model in the form of a partial differential equation with\nperiodic boundary conditions. This process can be easily justified if the\nexternal conditions in the frequency domain are nonzero only at low-frequency\nmodes. However, through numerical experiments, we discover that beyond the\nlow-frequency regime, the homogenization of the beam lattice differs from\nclassical periodic homogenization theory due to the additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom in the beams. A crucial technique in our analysis is the\ndecoupling of displacement and rotation fields, achieved through a linear\nalgebraic manipulation known as the Schur complement.
