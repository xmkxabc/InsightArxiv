Using only the camera captures as input to a system is an inexpensive\noption that enables localization in large indoor and outdoor environments, but\nit presents challenges in achieving high accuracy.

The Nerfacto model, an implementation of Neural Radiance Fields\n(NeRFs), is used to augment the data for training the pose regressor and to\nmeasure photometric loss in the particle filter refinement module.

However, panoramic images introduce severe\ndistortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted\nequirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap\nprojections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges,\nsuch as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries.\nTo address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to\nbridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian\nsplatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces\nto enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate\noptimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face\noptimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual\nconsistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians\nwithin individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic\nspace. Additionally, we introduce a spherical sampling technique to eliminate\nvisible stitching seams.

However,\nthese problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission\nthrough test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process.\nLarge language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting\nthe overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this\nend, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns\n(i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that\nboth the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these\nplans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by\nconventional approaches to code analysis.

In light of the widespread adoption of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), the intersection of humor and AI has become no\nlaughing matter. Advancements in the naturalness of human-computer interaction\ncorrelates with improvements in AI systems' abilities to understand humor. In\nthis study, we assess the ability of models in accurately identifying humorous\nquotes from a stand-up comedy transcript. Stand-up comedy's unique comedic\nnarratives make it an ideal dataset to improve the overall naturalness of\ncomedic understanding. We propose a novel humor detection metric designed to\nevaluate LLMs amongst various prompts on their capability to extract humorous\npunchlines. The metric has a modular structure that offers three different\nscoring methods - fuzzy string matching, sentence embedding, and subspace\nsimilarity - to provide an overarching assessment of a model's performance. The\nmodel's results are compared against those of human evaluators on the same\ntask. Our metric reveals that regardless of prompt engineering, leading models,\nChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, achieve scores of at most 51% in humor\ndetection.

Despite recent advances, there is no\ncomprehensive pipeline yet for bimanual class-agnostic interaction\nreconstruction from a monocular RGB video, where two hands and an unknown\nobject are interacting with each other. Previous works tackled the limited\nhand-object interaction case, where object templates are pre-known or only one\nhand is involved in the interaction. The bimanual interaction reconstruction\nexhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands\nand an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D\nGaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an\nunknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians\navoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained\ndiffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct\nunseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model\n(i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively\naccumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D\nalignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects\noptimization step during Gaussian optimization.

By modeling the long-range dependencies in these sequences, lesion\nareas can be more comprehensively mined, and modality-specific lesions can be\ndetected. To learn the long-range dependency relationship and fuse\ncomplementary multi-scale lesion features between different fundus modalities,\nwe design a multi-modal fundus image fusion method based on multi-scale\ncross-attention, which solves the static receptive field problem in previous\nmulti-modal medical fusion methods based on attention.

Subsequently, a multi-scale token\nselection mechanism is proposed to remove redundant noise and highlight\ndiscriminative, scale-specific cues at each stage. Finally, the selected tokens\nfrom each stage are independently utilized for bird recognition, and the\nrecognition results from multiple stages are adaptively fused through a\nmulti-scale dynamic aggregation mechanism for final model decisions.

Through experiments on three natural language\nunderstanding tasks (Belebele, XStoryCloze, XCOPA), and machine translation, we\nfind that while cross-lingual alignment metrics strongly correlate with task\naccuracy at the language level, the sample-level alignment often fails to\ndistinguish correct from incorrect predictions, exposing alignment as a\nnecessary but insufficient condition for success.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u5426\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5374\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLMs\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982DALI\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff08Belebele\u3001XStoryCloze\u3001XCOPA\uff09\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u5426\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6210\u529f\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u4f46\u975e\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u662fLLMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9760\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose the\nSafety-oriented Reasoning Optimization Framework (SaRO), which consists of two\nstages: (1) Reasoning-style Warmup (RW) that enables LLMs to internalize\nlong-chain reasoning through supervised fine-tuning, and (2) Safety-oriented\nReasoning Process Optimization (SRPO) that promotes safety reflection via\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of SaRO over traditional alignment methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSaRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6b20\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6b20\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "SaRO\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u5f0f\u9884\u70ed\uff08RW\uff09\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff08SRPO\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSaRO\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SaRO\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Medical images are often large and heterogeneous, where fine\ndetails are of vital clinical importance. Image properties change drastically\nwhen considering acquisition equipment, patient demographics, and pathology,\nmaking realistic medical image generation challenging. Recent work in latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs) has shown success in generating images resampled to a\nfixed-size. However, this is a narrow subset of the resolutions native to image\nacquisition, and resampling discards fine anatomical details.

Detecting Action Units (AUs)\nin micro-expressions is crucial because it yields a finer representation of\nfacial motions than categorical emotions, effectively resolving the ambiguity\namong different expressions. One of the difficulties in micro-expression\nanalysis is that facial motions are subtle and brief, thereby increasing the\ndifficulty in correlating facial motion features to AU occurrence. To bridge\nthe subtlety issue, flow-related features and motion magnification are a few\ncommon approaches as they can yield descriptive motion changes and increased\nmotion amplitude respectively. While motion magnification can amplify the\nmotion changes, it also accounts for illumination changes and projection errors\nduring the amplification process, thereby creating motion artefacts that\nconfuse the model to learn inauthentic magnified motion features.

To\nsystematically study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully\ncurated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new\nknowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this\ndataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can\nbe predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning.\nThis relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2,\nGemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel\ntechniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a\n``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update\npruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\\%\nwhile preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings\nprovide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for\nimproving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the\nDiffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across\ndifferent image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the\nnaturally varying information densities present in these regions. However,\nlarge compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression\nincreases computational complexity and compromises global consistency,\nultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by\nrecognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel\ntwo-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of\nimage generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical\nencoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates,\ntailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more\naccurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process.

The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed\nregions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local\nrealism.

Current methods address\nthese issues through retrieval-based techniques (grounding reasoning in\nexternal evidence), reasoning-based approaches (enhancing coherence via\nimproved prompting), or hybrid strategies combining both elements. One\nprominent hybrid method, ReAct, has outperformed purely retrieval-based or\nreasoning-based approaches; however, it lacks internal verification of\nintermediate reasoning steps, allowing potential errors to propagate through\ncomplex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning Court (RC), a\nnovel framework that extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval methods, such as\nReAct, with a dedicated LLM judge. Unlike ReAct, RC employs this judge to\nindependently evaluate multiple candidate answers and their associated\nreasoning generated by separate LLM agents. The judge is asked to select the\nanswer that it considers the most factually grounded and logically coherent\nbased on the presented reasoning and evidence, or synthesizes a new answer\nusing available evidence and its pre-trained knowledge if all candidates are\ninadequate, flawed, or invalid.

The second phase proposes a unique\nhomography-based refinement strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial\nalignment of the generated video. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method\nthrough experiments conducted on a dataset containing combinations of diverse\nscenes and reference videos containing a variety of camera motions.

Traditional registration methods\noften rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time\nperformance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures\nand can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial\nsolutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB\ncameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical\nguidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live\nsensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or\nCT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on\nthe depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration\nmodule for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a\ntracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module\nintegrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering\ntechnique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling,\nfollowed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative\nmodels with patient anatomy.

To explore the large swapping\naction space efficiently, an Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (EvoRL) agent\nis designed, where an actor recommends a set of suitable swapping actions from\na large action space based on the perceived puzzle status, a critic updates the\nactor using the estimated rewards and the puzzle status, and an evaluator\ncoupled with evolutionary strategies evolves the actions aligning with the\nhistorical assembly experience. The proposed ERL-MPP is comprehensively\nevaluated on the JPLEG-5 dataset with large gaps and the MIT dataset with\nlarge-scale puzzles. It significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models\non both datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u5934\u62fc\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff08ERL-MPP\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e26\u95f4\u9699\u62fc\u56fe\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u65e0\u95f4\u9699\u62fc\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e26\u95f4\u9699\u62fc\u56fe\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u5934\u62fc\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MPPN\uff09\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\uff08EvoRL\uff09\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5934\u611f\u77e5\u62fc\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728JPLEG-5\u548cMIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cERL-MPP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ERL-MPP\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e26\u95f4\u9699\u62fc\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing\nframework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in\nencoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11\nopen-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs\npredominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper\nlayers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer\nseparation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained\nprobing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we\npropose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by\nLLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly\nspecifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the\nresponse personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting\nbetween certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the\nrepresentational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a\ncomprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis,\ndemonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal\ndegradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and\nacceptable inference latency.

Thus, directly computing the position of the tool tip in the\ncamera frame using the vision-based method becomes an attractive solution.\nBesides, surgical instrument tip detection is the key component of other tasks,\nlike surgical skill assessment and surgery automation.

Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE)\nalgorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character\nbigrams. This often leads to segmentation that does not align with\nlinguistically meaningful units. To address this, we propose morphology-aware\nsegmentation as a pre-tokenization step prior to applying BPE. To facilitate\nmorphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi,\nincorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization. Experiments\non downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves\nperformance for machine translation and language modeling. Additionally, to\nhandle the ambiguity in the Unicode characters for diacritics, particularly\ndependent vowels in syllable-based writing systems, we introduce Constrained\nBPE (CBPE), an extension to the traditional BPE algorithm that incorporates\nscript-specific constraints. Specifically, CBPE handles dependent vowels. Our\nresults show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\\% reduction in fertility scores while\nmaintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine\ntranslation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE.\nMoreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we\nintroduce a new human evaluation metric, \\textit{EvalTok}, enabling more\nhuman-grounded assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7684\u9884\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6539\u8fdb\u7684BPE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08CBPE\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807EvalTok\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u65f6\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u8bcd\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3aBPE\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165CBPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u811a\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u5143\u97f3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0cCBPE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u751f\u80b2\u7387\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5206\u8bcd\u548cCBPE\u4e3a\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We show that stack operators are 1-Lipchitz extensions of set\noperators which can be represented by applying a characteristic set operator to\nthe cross-sections of the image and summing. In particular, they are a\ngeneralisation of stack filters, for which the characteristic set operators are\nincreasing. Our main result is that stack operators inherit lattice properties\nof the characteristic set operators.

To\ntrain and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting\nquestion-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets,\nleveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed\nspecifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process\nis employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train\nmultiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments\nconducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models\nachieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\\%. Notably, the smallest\nvariant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o,\nwhile xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance.

For VPR task, often fewer\ndiscriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while\nmundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing\nbecause of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and\nfull exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose\nthe Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image\nretrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting\nreliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing\npseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses,\nExtraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background\nContrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative\nlocal regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations\nand efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local\nfeature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from\naggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences\nground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking\npipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region\nguidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the\nstate-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and\nre-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR\nmethods in terms of computational efficiency.

While post-training pruning reduces model\nsize in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success.\nOur analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique\ntoken attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by\nthis observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework\ntailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity,\nwhich adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal\noutput tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2)\nAdaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative\nmultimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight\npruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT,\ndesigned for vision-language tasks, and VideoLLaMA2, capable of processing\naudio, visual, and language modalities.

To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision\nEncoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve\npixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment\nDecoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual\ncontext during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic\nintegration.

However, the\ncomputational complexity of self-attention, scaling quadratically with input\nsequence length, presents significant challenges for processing very long\nsequences or operating under resource constraints. This paper introduces the\nLearnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer (LMWT), a novel architecture that\nreplaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a learnable multi-scale\nHaar wavelet transform module. Leveraging the intrinsic multi-resolution\nproperties of wavelets, the LMWT efficiently captures both local details and\nglobal context. Crucially, the parameters of the wavelet transform, including\nscale-specific coefficients, are learned end-to-end during training, allowing\nthe model to adapt its decomposition strategy to the data and task. We present\nthe detailed mathematical formulation of the learnable Haar wavelet module and\nits integration into the transformer framework, supplemented by an\narchitectural diagram.

The present\nresearch examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty\nfor K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170).

Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate\nto strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy\nvaried by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast,\nthe feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with\ncorrelations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both\ndirect LLM predictions and baseline regressors.

Evaluated on the 3ET+ benchmark, our\nframework achieved 1.61 Euclidean distance on the private test set of the\nEvent-based Eye Tracking Challenge at CVPR 2025, demonstrating its\neffectiveness for practical deployment in AR/VR systems while providing a\nfoundation for future innovations in neuromorphic vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784KnightPupil\uff09\uff0c\u5728CVPR 2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u5feb\u901f\u773c\u52a8\u548c\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4d\u79fb\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5220\u9664\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2. \u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784KnightPupil\uff08EfficientNet-B3\u3001\u53cc\u5411GRU\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u53d8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u57283ET+\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e12%\uff081.61 vs 1.70\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\uff0c\u5728CVPR 2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u79c1\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAR/VR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u672a\u6765\u521b\u65b0\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important\nproblem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed\nthe tasks.

We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the\nprocess would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations\nwith LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually\nannotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation.\nHowever, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents.

To this end, we propose the\nMulti-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient\nmethod that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label\nco-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them\nrespectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group\ncontains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision\nTransformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label\nrelationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or\ndiscriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group\ncontains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to\nmultiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign\nthem from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware\nrepresentation, which is more conducive to classification.

In scenarios with rapid\nmotion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle\nto model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing\nreconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes\nduring exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving\nreconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted\nDeblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D\nGaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly\nlearns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion\ntrajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss\nfunction by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time,\nminimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images.

We hypothesize that\nthis is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data\nand b) labelled image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly,\nand labelled data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training\non large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics\ntransfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and\nnatural images. Therefore, we evaluate self pre-training, where models are\npre-trained on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a\nvision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in\nmicroelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). In MAE, a large share of\nimage patches is masked and reconstructed by the model during pre-training. We\nperform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10.000\nscanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images labelled using transient thermal\nanalysis (TTA).

However, most\nexisting methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the\nfact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse\ndistributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity\nintroduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across\ndistributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a\nprincipled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of\ndistribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of\npolicy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further\ntraining on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a\ndistribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM\npost-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to\ndynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This\napproach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage\n(exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and\ntheoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum\nlearning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its\neffectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and\nsources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves\nconvergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of\ndistribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

Under\n  review", "summary": "Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) as a multi-modal task, which aims to\nretrieve the target person from a pool of candidate images given a text\ndescription, has recently garnered considerable attention due to the progress\nof contrastive visual-language pre-trained model. Prior works leverage\npre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully\nfine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements\ncompared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model\nis prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method\nfor Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the\nmulti-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously\nintegrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and\nAdapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information\nwith task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust\nglobal feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are\noptimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix\nis proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation\nof prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla\nprefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer\nnormalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts\ncaused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art\nresults across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES,\nICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\\% parameters.

Using the\nstate-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking\nprocess via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly\neffective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms\nThinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning\ndatasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and\ncoding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with\n700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive\nwith pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a\nparallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs\nindependently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use\ntask-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies\nsuch as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines\nwith similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with\nsignificantly longer latency (up to 9x).

Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV\ncache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to\ninformation loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have\nbeen explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be\ndiscarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce\ninconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing\noutput perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed\nto eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict\nmemory constraints.

To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation\nstrategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\\%\nin preference alignment datasets and 14\\% in fact-related datasets, in-context\nlearning that provides up to 27\\% improvement on preference tasks but shows\ninconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that\nreduces biases by up to 10\\% in preference datasets and 16\\% in fact-related\ndatasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our\nwork provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge\nframeworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated\njudges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LRMs\u867d\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LRMs\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u6846\u67b6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e3b\u89c2\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86LRMs\u548cLLMs\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u4ece\u4f17\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5206\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4e13\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LRMs\u867d\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u201c\u8868\u9762\u53cd\u601d\u504f\u89c1\u201d\u3002\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e13\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u5bf9LRMs\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5224\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728LRMs\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Our\nexperiments show that canonical image processing methods like blurring and\nnoising cause a marginal impact on deep learning-based tasks. While\ndownsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer are effective in\nhiding user identifiers, iris style transfer, with higher computation cost,\noutperforms others in both utility tasks, and is more resilient against spoof\nattacks. Our analyses indicate that there is no universal optimal approach to\nbalance privacy, utility, and computation burden. Therefore, we recommend\npractitioners consider the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and\npossible combinations of those to reach an optimal privacy-utility trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6a61\u80f6\u7247\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8679\u819c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8679\u819c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "AR/VR\u5934\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u7528\u6237\u8679\u819c\u7eb9\u7406\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6a61\u80f6\u7247\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8679\u819c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8679\u819c\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u773c\u90e8\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6ce8\u89c6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u53ca\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8679\u819c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u666e\u9002\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u6743\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Although some recent methods are\ndesigned for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information\nduring token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In\nthis work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the\ntemporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).\nFirstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on\ninter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio\nencoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce\nthe number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based\nTransformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a\nlimited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame\ntokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding.\nFurthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free\nchain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple\nvideo segments.

Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability\ndensity estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between\nobjects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object\nand temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing.\nInspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a\nprogressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers\nfrom sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the\nbackbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global\nfeature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of\nsparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic\naffinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable\nhigh-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object\nrepresentation.

While semi-supervised\nmethods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer\nfrom high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently,\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection.\nHowever, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder\nreal-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways\nin human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that\nintegrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly\nconfidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than\nthe entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM\nfor elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to\ndomain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal\npatterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs.\nDuring inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts\nfor anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast\nand slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection.

For this task, monocular category-level methods are\nattractive as they require only a single RGB camera. However, current methods\nrely on shape priors or CAD models of the intra-class known objects. We propose\na diffusion-based monocular category-level 9D object pose generation method,\nMonoDiff9D. Our motivation is to leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion\nmodels to alleviate the need for shape priors, CAD models, or depth sensors for\nintra-class unknown object pose estimation. We first estimate coarse depth via\nDINOv2 from the monocular image in a zero-shot manner and convert it into a\npoint cloud. We then fuse the global features of the point cloud with the input\nimage and use the fused features along with the encoded time step to condition\nMonoDiff9D.

However, most of them\nstruggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is\nflat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often\nthe most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation. To this end,\nwe propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs\ninto 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D\nimage generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully\nenhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying\nthe process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of\npainting styles. To benchmark the generalization performance of existing\nimage-to-3D models on flat-colored images without 3D feeling, we collect a new\ndataset, Flat-2D, with over 100 samples.

However, for latent\ndiffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and\ndiffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a\ndegradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is\nineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the\nrepresentation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model\nto be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the\nproposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up\ndiffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training\nrecipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with\nREPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure\nand downstream generation performance.

Prior works formulate the\ntraffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire\nsequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full\nsequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted\nnext-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned\nmodel struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large\nnumber of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome\nthese, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves\nreactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging\nscenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core\nof the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking\ntraining strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental\nupdates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario\ngeneration, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases.

According to the\ninformation expression division of pixel pairs in the original fused image, we\nclassify pixel pairs with significant performance as the positive domain and\nnon-significant pixel pairs as the boundary domain. We perform split inference\nin the brightness space using Granular Ball adaptation to compute weights for\npixels that express information to varying degrees, generating approximate\nsupervision images that provide priors for the neural network in the structural\nbrightness space. Additionally, the extracted global saliency features also\nadaptively provide priors for setting the loss function weights of each image\nin the network, guiding the network to converge quickly at both global and\npixel levels alongside the supervised images, thereby enhancing the\nexpressiveness of the fused images.

In this space, both low-level and\nhigh-level speech features are projected, enabling motion-aligned speech\nrepresentation using learnable speech queries. Then, a speech-queried attention\nmechanism (SQA) is introduced to compute frame-level attention scores through\ninteractions between motion keys and speech queries, guiding selective masking\ntoward motion frames with high attention scores.

However, the challenge of\nenabling deep models to learn representations from unpaired modalities remains\nunresolved. This issue is especially pertinent in scenarios like Federated\nLearning (FL), where data is often decentralized, heterogeneous, and lacks a\nreliable guarantee of paired data. Previous attempts tackled this issue through\nthe use of auxiliary pretrained encoders or generative models on local clients,\nwhich invariably raise computational cost with increasing number modalities.\nUnlike these approaches, in this paper, we aim to address the task of unpaired\naudio and image recognition using \\texttt{FSSUAVL}, a single deep model\npretrained in FL with self-supervised contrastive learning (SSL).

We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives,\nand to provide a practical guide for practitioners.

Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under\nmild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the\ninformation related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to\nselection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for\nunderstanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights\ninto how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems.

However, panoramic images introduce severe\ndistortion, making it challenging to render 3D Gaussians into 2D distorted\nequirectangular space directly. Converting equirectangular images to cubemap\nprojections partially alleviates this problem but introduces new challenges,\nsuch as projection distortion and discontinuities across cube-face boundaries.\nTo address these limitations, we present a novel framework, named TPGS, to\nbridge continuous panoramic 3D scene reconstruction with perspective Gaussian\nsplatting. Firstly, we introduce a Transition Plane between adjacent cube faces\nto enable smoother transitions in splatting directions and mitigate\noptimization ambiguity in the boundary region. Moreover, an intra-to-inter face\noptimization strategy is proposed to enhance local details and restore visual\nconsistency across cube-face boundaries. Specifically, we optimize 3D Gaussians\nwithin individual cube faces and then fine-tune them in the stitched panoramic\nspace.

However,\nthese problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission\nthrough test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process.\nLarge language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting\nthe overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this\nend, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns\n(i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that\nboth the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these\nplans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by\nconventional approaches to code analysis.

The bimanual interaction reconstruction\nexhibits severe occlusions introduced by complex interactions between two hands\nand an object. To solve this, we first introduce BIGS (Bimanual Interaction 3D\nGaussian Splatting), a method that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of hands and an\nunknown object from a monocular video. To robustly obtain object Gaussians\navoiding severe occlusions, we leverage prior knowledge of pre-trained\ndiffusion model with score distillation sampling (SDS) loss, to reconstruct\nunseen object parts. For hand Gaussians, we exploit the 3D priors of hand model\n(i.e., MANO) and share a single Gaussian for two hands to effectively\naccumulate hand 3D information, given limited views. To further consider the 3D\nalignment between hands and objects, we include the interacting-subjects\noptimization step during Gaussian optimization. Our method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging datasets, in terms of 3D hand pose\nestimation (MPJPE), 3D object reconstruction (CDh, CDo, F10), and rendering\nquality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBIGS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u53cc\u624b\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u624b\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08SDS\u635f\u5931\uff09\u548c\u624b\u90e83D\u5148\u9a8c\uff08MANO\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u5efa3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "BIGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53cc\u624b\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods\noften outperform Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods in FGBR,\nrecent studies reveal that the limited receptive field of plain ViT model\nhinders representational richness and makes them vulnerable to scale variance.\nThus, enhancing the multi-scale capabilities of existing ViT-based models to\novercome this bottleneck in FGBR is a worthwhile pursuit. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for FGBR, namely Multi-scale Diverse Cues Modeling\n(MDCM), which explores diverse cues at different scales across various stages\nof a multi-scale Vision Transformer (MS-ViT) in an\n\"Activation-Selection-Aggregation\" paradigm. Specifically, we first propose a\nmulti-scale cue activation module to ensure the discriminative cues learned at\ndifferent stage are mutually different.

This\nresults in smaller, more specific hypotheses being favored over more general\nones. For instance, when provided the set {Austin, Dallas, Houston}, one is\nmore likely to think that this is sampled from \"Texas Cities\" over \"US Cities\"\neven though both are compatible. Suspicious coincidence is strongly connected\nto pragmatic reasoning, and can serve as a testbed to analyze systems on their\nsensitivity towards the communicative goals of the task (i.e., figuring out the\ntrue category underlying the data). In this paper, we analyze whether\nsuspicious coincidence effects are reflected in language models' (LMs)\nbehavior. We do so in the context of two domains: 1) the number game, where\nhumans made judgments of whether a number (e.g., 4) fits a list of given\nnumbers (e.g., 16, 32, 2); and 2) by extending the number game setup to\nprominent cities. For both domains, the data is compatible with multiple\nhypotheses and we study which hypothesis is most consistent with the models'\nbehavior.

We consider the task of text\nsimplification, commonly used to improve information accessibility, where\nevaluation faces two major challenges. First, the data in existing benchmarks\nmight not reflect the capabilities of current language models on the task,\noften containing disfluent, incoherent, or simplistic examples. Second,\nexisting human ratings associated with the benchmarks often contain a high\ndegree of disagreement, resulting in inconsistent ratings; nevertheless,\nexisting metrics still have to show higher correlations with these imperfect\nratings. As a result, evaluation for the task is not reliable and does not\nreflect expected trends (e.g., more powerful models being assigned higher\nscores). We address these challenges for the task of text simplification\nthrough three contributions. First, we introduce SynthSimpliEval, a synthetic\nbenchmark for text simplification featuring simplified sentences generated by\nmodels of varying sizes. Through a pilot study, we show that human ratings on\nour benchmark exhibit high inter-annotator agreement and reflect the expected\ntrend: larger models produce higher-quality simplifications.

Notably,\nhuman experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\\%. These results\nunderscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and\nhighlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in\nunderstanding video that requires high FPS sampling.

Detecting Action Units (AUs)\nin micro-expressions is crucial because it yields a finer representation of\nfacial motions than categorical emotions, effectively resolving the ambiguity\namong different expressions. One of the difficulties in micro-expression\nanalysis is that facial motions are subtle and brief, thereby increasing the\ndifficulty in correlating facial motion features to AU occurrence. To bridge\nthe subtlety issue, flow-related features and motion magnification are a few\ncommon approaches as they can yield descriptive motion changes and increased\nmotion amplitude respectively. While motion magnification can amplify the\nmotion changes, it also accounts for illumination changes and projection errors\nduring the amplification process, thereby creating motion artefacts that\nconfuse the model to learn inauthentic magnified motion features. The problem\nis further aggravated in the context of a more complicated task where more AU\nclasses are analyzed in cross-database settings. To address this issue, we\npropose InfuseNet, a layer-wise unitary feature infusion framework that\nleverages motion context to constrain the Action Unit (AU) learning within an\ninformative facial movement region, thereby alleviating the influence of\nmagnification artefacts.

We demonstrate that when learning new\ninformation, LLMs exhibit a \"priming\" effect: learning a new fact can cause the\nmodel to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To\nsystematically study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully\ncurated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new\nknowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this\ndataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can\nbe predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning.\nThis relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2,\nGemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel\ntechniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a\n``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update\npruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\\%\nwhile preserving the model's ability to learn new information.

Our findings\nrevealed four key insights: First, ViTs exhibited an oblique effect showing the\nlowest angle prediction errors at 180 deg (horizontal) across all conditions.\nSecond, angle prediction errors varied by color. Errors were highest for bluish\nhues and lowest for yellowish ones. Additionally, clustering analysis of angle\nprediction errors showed that ViTs grouped colors in a way that aligned with\nhuman perceptual categories. In addition to orientation and color biases, we\nobserved phase transition phenomena. While two phase transitions occurred\nconsistently across all conditions, the training loss curves exhibited delayed\ntransitions when color was incorporated as an additional data attribute.\nFinally, we observed that attention heads in certain layers inherently develop\nspecialized capabilities, functioning as task-agnostic feature extractors\nregardless of the downstream task.

Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the\nDiffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, it applies fixed compression across\ndifferent image regions during the diffusion process, disregarding the\nnaturally varying information densities present in these regions. However,\nlarge compression leads to limited local realism, while small compression\nincreases computational complexity and compromises global consistency,\nultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by\nrecognizing the importance of different regions, and introduce a novel\ntwo-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of\nimage generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical\nencoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates,\ntailored to their specific information densities, thereby providing more\naccurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic\nDiffusion Transformer (D$^2$iT) at second stage generates images by predicting\nmulti-grained noise, consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth\nregions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions), through an\nnovel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content\nTransformer.

For\nexample, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have\nbeen useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics\n(simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to\ndifferent outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld\nconfiguration or initial physical conditions).

We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math\nproblems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a\nprogram synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed\nmath problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs\nthat are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the\nseed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess\nin terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as\nverifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We\ndemonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining\nfaithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that\nEFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math\nproblems.

Traditional registration methods\noften rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time\nperformance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures\nand can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial\nsolutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB\ncameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical\nguidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live\nsensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or\nCT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on\nthe depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration\nmodule for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a\ntracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module\nintegrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering\ntechnique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling,\nfollowed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative\nmodels with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust\nregistration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module\nto estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the\nperformance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements.

A multi-level feature fusion mechanism is devised to enhance\ninformation interaction between the two branches, achieving neighborhood\nfeature alignment and channel-adaptive selection, thereby organically\nintegrating heterogeneous features and mitigating geometric distortion.\nExtensive experiments on two airborne HPCs datasets demonstrate that PiV-AHPC\npossesses state-of-the-art detection performance and high generalization\ncapability.", "AI": {"tldr": "PiV-AHPC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u8f7d\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u70b9\u4e91\uff08HPCs\uff09\u76843D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u51e0\u4f55-\u5149\u8c31\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HPCs\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u878d\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55-\u5149\u8c31\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u673a\u8f7d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPiV-AHPC\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u67f1-\u4f53\u7d20\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53d6\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u8f7dHPCs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPiV-AHPC\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PiV-AHPC\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86HPCs\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55-\u5149\u8c31\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u8f7d\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To effectively fuse visual and semantic information, we\npropose a novel bridging multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, aligning\nsemantic tags with visual embeddings while maintaining minimal computational\noverhead. AeroLite's flexible design also enables seamless integration with\nvarious pretrained large language models.

These methods work by constructing\ncontrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the\noutput distribution.

The performance improvements\nobserved on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1)\ncrude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2)\nthe adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to\ngreedy search.

Despite their usefulness, we\nuncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full)\nforget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset\n(functioning as a \"coreset\"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even\nwhen selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks\ncan be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We\ndemonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM\nunlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU\n(Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks.\nThe surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data\nselection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated\nheuristic approaches.

However, traditional remote sensing\nworkflows often rely on explicit segmentation or detection methods, which\nstruggle to handle complex, implicit queries that require reasoning over\nspatial context, domain knowledge, and implicit user intent. Motivated by this,\nwe introduce a new task, \\ie, geospatial pixel reasoning, which allows implicit\nquerying and reasoning and generates the mask of the target region. To advance\nthis task, we construct and release the first large-scale benchmark dataset\ncalled EarthReason, which comprises 5,434 manually annotated image masks with\nover 30,000 implicit question-answer pairs. Moreover, we propose SegEarth-R1, a\nsimple yet effective language-guided segmentation baseline that integrates a\nhierarchical visual encoder, a large language model (LLM) for instruction\nparsing, and a tailored mask generator for spatial correlation. The design of\nSegEarth-R1 incorporates domain-specific adaptations, including aggressive\nvisual token compression to handle ultra-high-resolution remote sensing images,\na description projection module to fuse language and multi-scale features, and\na streamlined mask prediction pipeline that directly queries description\nembeddings.

We first demonstrate that explicitly providing\ncultural context in prompts significantly improves the models' ability to\ngenerate culturally localized responses. We term the disparity in model\nperformance with versus without explicit cultural context the explicit-implicit\nlocalization gap, indicating that while cultural knowledge exists within LLMs,\nit may not naturally surface in multilingual interactions if cultural context\nis not explicitly provided.

To address this, we introduce the uncertainty\nguidance learning approach to SOD, intended to enhance the model's perception\nof uncertain regions. Specifically, we design a novel Uncertainty Guided\nRefinement Attention Network (UGRAN), which incorporates three important\ncomponents, i.e., the Multilevel Interaction Attention (MIA) module, the Scale\nSpatial-Consistent Attention (SSCA) module, and the Uncertainty Refinement\nAttention (URA) module. Unlike conventional methods dedicated to enhancing\nfeatures, the proposed MIA facilitates the interaction and perception of\nmultilevel features, leveraging the complementary characteristics among\nmultilevel features. Then, through the proposed SSCA, the salient information\nacross diverse scales within the aggregated features can be integrated more\ncomprehensively and integrally. In the subsequent steps, we utilize the\nuncertainty map generated from the saliency prediction map to enhance the\nmodel's perception capability of uncertain regions, generating a\nhighly-saturated fine-grained saliency prediction map.

In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing\nframework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in\nencoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11\nopen-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs\npredominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper\nlayers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer\nseparation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained\nprobing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we\npropose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by\nLLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly\nspecifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the\nresponse personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting\nbetween certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the\nrepresentational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a\ncomprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis,\ndemonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal\ndegradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and\nacceptable inference latency.

For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored\ntranslations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and\na blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a\nvariety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as\nmeta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo\nscores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their\naverage performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their\nability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which\nlanguages are most difficult.

While LRMs have achieved\nsignificant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks through explicit chains of\nthought, their reliance on deep analytical thinking may limit their system 1\nthinking capabilities. Moreover, a lack of benchmark currently exists to\nevaluate LRMs' performance in tasks that require such capabilities.

To address these problems, we propose two new\nstrategies, density-guided anchors (DGA) and density-guided NMS (DG-NMS), which\nuses object density maps to jointly compute optimal anchor assignments and\nreweighing, as well as an adaptive NMS. Concretely, based on an unbalanced\noptimal transport (UOT) problem, the density owned by each ground-truth object\nis transported to each anchor position at a minimal transport cost. And density\non anchors comprises an instance-specific density distribution, from which DGA\ndecodes the optimal anchor assignment and re-weighting strategy. Meanwhile,\nDG-NMS utilizes the predicted density map to adaptively adjust the NMS\nthreshold to reduce mistaken suppressions.

However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting,\nrequires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by\nmultimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient\nsampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing\npoint-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit)\nand complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling\nalgorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel\nlevel), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different\ntexture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we\npropose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which\nemploys Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into\npixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training.

Unlike\nexisting methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during\nLLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the\nentire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision\nEncoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve\npixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment\nDecoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual\ncontext during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic\nintegration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we\ndevelop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a\nSynthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data\nsynthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided\nfeature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two\nscales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens.\nNotably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most\nbenchmarks.

However, the\ncomputational complexity of self-attention, scaling quadratically with input\nsequence length, presents significant challenges for processing very long\nsequences or operating under resource constraints. This paper introduces the\nLearnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer (LMWT), a novel architecture that\nreplaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a learnable multi-scale\nHaar wavelet transform module. Leveraging the intrinsic multi-resolution\nproperties of wavelets, the LMWT efficiently captures both local details and\nglobal context. Crucially, the parameters of the wavelet transform, including\nscale-specific coefficients, are learned end-to-end during training, allowing\nthe model to adapt its decomposition strategy to the data and task. We present\nthe detailed mathematical formulation of the learnable Haar wavelet module and\nits integration into the transformer framework, supplemented by an\narchitectural diagram.

The present\nresearch examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty\nfor K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170). Two estimation\napproaches were implemented: (a) a direct estimation method that prompted the\nLLM to assign a single difficulty rating to each item, and (b) a feature-based\nstrategy where the LLM extracted multiple cognitive and linguistic features,\nwhich were then used in ensemble tree-based models (random forests and gradient\nboosting) to predict difficulty. Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate\nto strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy\nvaried by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast,\nthe feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with\ncorrelations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both\ndirect LLM predictions and baseline regressors. These findings highlight the\npromise of LLMs in streamlining item development and reducing reliance on\nextensive field testing and underscore the importance of structured feature\nextraction.

However, they typically\nencounter dual challenges: the mismatch between general language\nrepresentations and domain-specific preference patterns, as well as the limited\nadaptability to multi-domain recommendation scenarios. To bridge these gaps, we\nintroduce CPRec -- an All-domain Continual Pre-Training framework for\nRecommendation -- designed to holistically align LLMs with universal user\nbehaviors through the continual pre-training paradigm. Specifically, we first\ndesign a unified prompt template and organize users' multi-domain behaviors\ninto domain-specific behavioral sequences and all-domain mixed behavioral\nsequences that emulate real-world user decision logic. To optimize behavioral\nknowledge infusion, we devise a Warmup-Stable-Annealing learning rate schedule\ntailored for the continual pre-training paradigm in recommendation to\nprogressively enhance the LLM's capability in knowledge adaptation from\nopen-world knowledge to universal recommendation tasks.

These\nmethods generate heatmaps that highlight the parts of the input most relevant\nto the CNN output. Various CAM methods have been proposed, each distinguished\nby the expressions used to derive heatmaps. In general, users look for heatmaps\nwith specific properties that reflect different aspects of CNN functionality.\nThese may include similarity to ground truth, robustness, equivariance, and\nmore. Although existing CAM methods implicitly encode some of these properties\nin their expressions, they do not allow for variability in heatmap generation\nfollowing the user's intent or domain knowledge.

We hypothesize that\nthis is due to the fact that a) transformers have an increased need for data\nand b) labelled image generation procedures for microelectronics are costly,\nand labelled data is therefore sparse. Whereas in other domains, pre-training\non large natural image datasets can mitigate this problem, in microelectronics\ntransfer learning is hindered due to the dissimilarity of domain data and\nnatural images. Therefore, we evaluate self pre-training, where models are\npre-trained on the target dataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a\nvision transformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in\nmicroelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). In MAE, a large share of\nimage patches is masked and reconstructed by the model during pre-training. We\nperform pre-training and defect detection using a dataset of less than 10.000\nscanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) images labelled using transient thermal\nanalysis (TTA). Our experimental results show that our approach leads to\nsubstantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT pre-trained\non natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect detection\nmodels used in the literature. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals\nthat our self pre-trained models, in comparison to ViT baselines, correctly\nfocus on defect-relevant features such as cracks in the solder material.

However, most\nexisting methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the\nfact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse\ndistributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity\nintroduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across\ndistributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a\nprincipled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of\ndistribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of\npolicy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further\ntraining on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a\ndistribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM\npost-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to\ndynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This\napproach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage\n(exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and\ntheoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum\nlearning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its\neffectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and\nsources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves\nconvergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of\ndistribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

Our approach features a multi-scale visual encoder\nequipped with two novel modules: the Learnable Token Enhancement Block (LTEB),\nwhich adaptively weights tokens to emphasize crucial saliency cues, and the\nDynamic Learnable Token Fusion Block (DLTFB), which employs a shifting\noperation to reorganize and merge features, effectively capturing long-range\ndependencies and detailed spatial information. In parallel, an audio branch\nprocesses raw audio signals to extract meaningful auditory features. Both\nvisual and audio features are integrated using our Adaptive Multimodal Fusion\nBlock (AMFB), which employs local, global, and adaptive fusion streams for\nprecise cross-modal fusion. The resulting fused features are processed by a\nhierarchical multi-decoder structure, producing accurate saliency maps.\nExtensive evaluations on six audio-visual benchmarks demonstrate that DFTSal\nachieves SOTA performance while maintaining computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFTSal\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u878d\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5df2\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u542c\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "DFTSal\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542bLTEB\u548cDLTFB\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u97f3\u9891\u5206\u652f\u548cAMFB\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDFTSal\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DFTSal\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u878d\u5408\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To ensure high-quality\nfeedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated\nreliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback\nquality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests.\nThe results show that 27% of reviewers who received feedback updated their\nreviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated\nby those reviewers. This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated\nfeedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews. Incorporating AI\nfeedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words\namong those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews,\nas evaluated by blinded researchers.

Under\n  review", "summary": "Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) as a multi-modal task, which aims to\nretrieve the target person from a pool of candidate images given a text\ndescription, has recently garnered considerable attention due to the progress\nof contrastive visual-language pre-trained model. Prior works leverage\npre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully\nfine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements\ncompared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model\nis prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method\nfor Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the\nmulti-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously\nintegrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and\nAdapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information\nwith task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust\nglobal feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are\noptimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix\nis proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation\nof prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla\nprefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer\nnormalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts\ncaused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art\nresults across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES,\nICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\\% parameters.

When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms\nThinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning\ndatasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and\ncoding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with\n700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive\nwith pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a\nparallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs\nindependently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use\ntask-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies\nsuch as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines\nwith similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with\nsignificantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a\nreconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also\nestablishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance\nin low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08NoThinking\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97\u6216\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NoThinking\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "NoThinking\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97\u6216\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Relying on the Mamba and the fact that low-resolution\nimages rely on global information to compensate for missing details, while\nhigh-resolution reference images need to provide more local details for\naccurate super-resolution, we propose a global and local Mamba network\n(GLMamba) for multi-modality medical image super-resolution.

Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV\ncache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to\ninformation loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have\nbeen explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be\ndiscarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce\ninconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing\noutput perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed\nto eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict\nmemory constraints.

To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation\nstrategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\\%\nin preference alignment datasets and 14\\% in fact-related datasets, in-context\nlearning that provides up to 27\\% improvement on preference tasks but shows\ninconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that\nreduces biases by up to 10\\% in preference datasets and 16\\% in fact-related\ndatasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our\nwork provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge\nframeworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated\njudges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728LLM-as-a-judge\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LRMs\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LRMs\u5728\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u65f6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6bd4\u8f83LLMs\u548cLRMs\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LRMs\u6613\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u5bf9LRMs\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM-as-a-judge\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLRMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Eye trackers within HMDs provide a special opportunity for such\nsetups as it is possible to facilitate gaze-based research and interaction.\nHowever, estimating users' gaze information often requires raw eye images and\nvideos that contain iris textures, which are considered a gold standard\nbiometric for user authentication, and this raises privacy concerns. Previous\nresearch in the eye-tracking community focused on obfuscating iris textures\nwhile keeping utility tasks such as gaze estimation accurate. Despite these\nattempts, there is no comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art\napproaches. Considering all, in this paper, we benchmark blurring, noising,\ndownsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer to obfuscate user\nidentity, and compare their impact on image quality, privacy, utility, and risk\nof imposter attack on two datasets. We use eye segmentation and gaze estimation\nas utility tasks, and reduction in iris recognition accuracy as a measure of\nprivacy protection, and false acceptance rate to estimate risk of attack. Our\nexperiments show that canonical image processing methods like blurring and\nnoising cause a marginal impact on deep learning-based tasks.

In\nthis work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the\ntemporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).\nFirstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on\ninter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio\nencoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce\nthe number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based\nTransformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a\nlimited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame\ntokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding.\nFurthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free\nchain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple\nvideo segments.

Current deep learning-based MOD methods rely on probability\ndensity estimation, which restricts flexible information interaction between\nobjects and across temporal frames. To flexibly capture high-order inter-object\nand temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing.\nInspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a\nprogressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers\nfrom sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the\nbackbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global\nfeature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of\nsparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic\naffinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable\nhigh-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object\nrepresentation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and\nGlobal Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning\nmechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the\nprogressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport\nassignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each\ndenoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to\ncounteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects.\nExperiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method\nbased on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential\nrelationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection\ncapability and temporal consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u9065\u611f\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u805a\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6781\u5c0f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e27\u95f4\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u53bb\u566a\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u805a\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u70b9\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdbMinK\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728RsData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6316\u6398\u7a00\u758f\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have\nre-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match\ndiffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion\nmodels fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences\nin structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of\nattention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image\nediting, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we\nintroduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing\nstrategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention\nmanipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by\ndynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the\nAnchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural\nconsistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing\nwhile maintaining generative autonomy.

An efficient classification model can help wound\nspecialists classify wound types with less financial and time costs and also\nhelp in deciding on the optimal treatment method.

Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful\ntool in wound diagnosis. Although DL seems promising for wound type\nrecognition, there is still a large scope for improving the efficiency and\naccuracy of the model. In this study, a DL-based multimodal classifier was\ndeveloped using wound images and their corresponding locations to classify them\ninto multiple classes, including diabetic, pressure, surgical, and venous\nulcers. A body map was also created to provide location data, which can help\nwound specialists label wound locations more effectively. The model uses a\nVision Transformer to extract hierarchical features from input images, a\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) layer to capture low and high frequency\ncomponents, and a Transformer to extract spatial features. The number of\nneurons and weight vector optimization were performed using three swarm-based\noptimization techniques (Monster Gorilla Toner (MGTO), Improved Gray Wolf\nOptimization (IGWO), and Fox Optimization Algorithm). The evaluation results\nshow that weight vector optimization using optimization algorithms can increase\ndiagnostic accuracy and make it a very effective approach for wound detection.\nIn the classification using the original body map, the proposed model was able\nto achieve an accuracy of 0.8123 using image data and an accuracy of 0.8007\nusing a combination of image data and wound location.

However, most of them\nstruggle to synthesize plausible 3D assets when the reference image is\nflat-colored like hand drawings due to the lack of 3D illusion, which are often\nthe most user-friendly input modalities in art content creation. To this end,\nwe propose Art3D, a training-free method that can lift flat-colored 2D designs\ninto 3D. By leveraging structural and semantic features with pre- trained 2D\nimage generation models and a VLM-based realism evaluation, Art3D successfully\nenhances the three-dimensional illusion in reference images, thus simplifying\nthe process of generating 3D from 2D, and proves adaptable to a wide range of\npainting styles.

Rather than adapting a\ntext-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and\nlinguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora\nduring a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency.

However, for latent\ndiffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and\ndiffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a\ndegradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is\nineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the\nrepresentation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model\nto be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the\nproposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up\ndiffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training\nrecipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with\nREPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure\nand downstream generation performance.

Previous works utilize neural fields together with\nphysically based rendering (PBR), to estimate geometry and disentangle\nappearance properties of human avatars. However, one drawback of these methods\nis the slow rendering speed due to the expensive Monte Carlo ray tracing. To\ntackle this problem, we proposed to distill the knowledge from implicit neural\nfields (teacher) to explicit 2D Gaussian splatting (student) representation to\ntake advantage of the fast rasterization property of Gaussian splatting.

This leads to few-shot training for a general image fusion\nnetwork, and based on this, we propose the GBFF fusion method. According to the\ninformation expression division of pixel pairs in the original fused image, we\nclassify pixel pairs with significant performance as the positive domain and\nnon-significant pixel pairs as the boundary domain. We perform split inference\nin the brightness space using Granular Ball adaptation to compute weights for\npixels that express information to varying degrees, generating approximate\nsupervision images that provide priors for the neural network in the structural\nbrightness space. Additionally, the extracted global saliency features also\nadaptively provide priors for setting the loss function weights of each image\nin the network, guiding the network to converge quickly at both global and\npixel levels alongside the supervised images, thereby enhancing the\nexpressiveness of the fused images.

This approach relies on the core assumption\nthat the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an\nidentical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world\ndatasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how\nto address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other\nleveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives,\nand to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable\nmodels we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms:\nselection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation\nbias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables\nshared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under\nmild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the\ninformation related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to\nselection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for\nunderstanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights\ninto how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems.
