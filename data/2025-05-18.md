*Xabier Morales,Ayah Elsayed,Debbie Zhao,Filip Loncaric,Ainhoa Aguado,Mireia Masias,Gina Quill,Marc Ramos,Ada Doltra,Ana Garcia,Marta Sitges,David Marlevi,Alistair Young,Martyn Nash,Bart Bijnens,Oscar Camara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种针对左心房（LA）4D Flow MRI分析的开源计算框架，解决了传统超声分析的局限性，并首次全面评估了能量、涡度和压力参数作为预后生物标志物的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声分析对左心房血流动力学的理解有限，而4D Flow MRI虽具潜力，但受限于低流速、低分辨率及缺乏专用计算框架。

Method: 开发了一个开源计算框架，支持不同中心数据的定性定量分析，实现了高精度自动分割（Dice > 0.9，Hausdorff 95 < 3 mm）。

Result: 框架对不同质量数据表现稳健，并首次全面评估了能量、涡度和压力参数在多种疾病中的预后价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为左心房血流动力学研究提供了可靠工具，并揭示了新型生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: The left atrium (LA) plays a pivotal role in modulating left ventricular
filling, but our comprehension of its hemodynamics is significantly limited by
the constraints of conventional ultrasound analysis. 4D flow magnetic resonance
imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial
hemodynamics. However, the low velocities within the LA and the limited spatial
resolution of 4D Flow MRI make analyzing this chamber challenging. Furthermore,
the absence of dedicated computational frameworks, combined with diverse
acquisition protocols and vendors, complicates gathering large cohorts for
studying the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters provided by 4D Flow
MRI. In this study, we introduce the first open-source computational framework
tailored for the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters. Our
framework proves robust to data from different centers of varying quality,
producing high-accuracy automated segmentations (Dice $>$ 0.9 and Hausdorff 95
$<$ 3 mm), even with limited training data. Additionally, we conducted the
first comprehensive assessment of energy, vorticity, and pressure parameters in
the LA across a spectrum of disorders to investigate their potential as
prognostic biomarkers.

### [2] [Dyadic Mamba: Long-term Dyadic Human Motion Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09827)
*Julian Tanke,Takashi Shibuya,Kengo Uchida,Koichi Saito,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dyadic Mamba利用状态空间模型（SSMs）生成长时间高质量的双人运动，解决了传统Transformer方法在长序列生成中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在生成长时间双人运动时表现不佳，主要受限于位置编码方案。

Method: 提出Dyadic Mamba，通过简单有效的架构（基于SSMs）实现信息流动，无需复杂交叉注意力机制。

Result: 在短序列基准上表现优异，长序列生成显著优于Transformer方法，并提出了新的长序列评估基准。

Conclusion: SSM架构为长时双人运动生成提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic dyadic human motion from text descriptions presents
significant challenges, particularly for extended interactions that exceed
typical training sequence lengths. While recent transformer-based approaches
have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they
struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional
encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach
that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human
motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective
architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion
sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex
cross-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that Dyadic Mamba achieves
competitive performance on standard short-term benchmarks while significantly
outperforming transformer-based approaches on longer sequences. Additionally,
we propose a new benchmark for evaluating long-term motion synthesis quality,
providing a standardized framework for future research. Our results demonstrate
that SSM-based architectures offer a promising direction for addressing the
challenging task of long-term dyadic human motion synthesis from text
descriptions.

### [3] [BoundarySeg:An Embarrassingly Simple Method To Boost Medical Image Segmentation Performance for Low Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09829)
*Tushar Kataria,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BoundarySeg的多任务框架，通过结合器官边界预测作为辅助任务，提升医学图像分割的准确性，无需依赖未标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据获取和标注困难，半监督方法依赖未标注数据且效果有限。

Method: BoundarySeg框架将器官边界预测作为辅助任务，利用任务间一致性提供额外监督。

Result: 在低数据情况下表现优异，性能媲美或超越现有半监督方法。

Conclusion: BoundarySeg提供了一种高效且不依赖未标注数据的医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale medical data, annotated or unannotated, is challenging
due to stringent privacy regulations and data protection policies. In addition,
annotating medical images requires that domain experts manually delineate
anatomical structures, making the process both time-consuming and costly. As a
result, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity for reducing annotation
costs. However, the performance of semi-supervised methods is heavily dependent
on the availability of unannotated data, and their effectiveness declines when
such data are scarce or absent. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
simple, yet effective and computationally efficient approach for medical image
segmentation that leverages only existing annotations. We propose BoundarySeg ,
a multi-task framework that incorporates organ boundary prediction as an
auxiliary task to full organ segmentation, leveraging consistency between the
two task predictions to provide additional supervision. This strategy improves
segmentation accuracy, especially in low data regimes, allowing our method to
achieve performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art semi supervised
approaches all without relying on unannotated data or increasing computational
demands. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本条件扩散的两阶段方法，通过合成手术视频解决数据不平衡问题，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频数据集中严重的数据不平衡阻碍了高性能模型的开发，需要一种方法来生成高质量且类别平衡的合成数据。

Method: 采用两阶段、基于文本条件的扩散方法，分离空间和时间建模，并结合拒绝采样策略选择最佳合成样本。

Result: 在手术动作识别和术中事件预测任务中，合成视频显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据不平衡问题，并通过开源实现促进了进一步研究。

Abstract: Computer-assisted interventions can improve intra-operative guidance,
particularly through deep learning methods that harness the spatiotemporal
information in surgical videos. However, the severe data imbalance often found
in surgical video datasets hinders the development of high-performing models.
In this work, we aim to overcome the data imbalance by synthesizing surgical
videos. We propose a unique two-stage, text-conditioned diffusion-based method
to generate high-fidelity surgical videos for under-represented classes. Our
approach conditions the generation process on text prompts and decouples
spatial and temporal modeling by utilizing a 2D latent diffusion model to
capture spatial content and then integrating temporal attention layers to
ensure temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a rejection sampling
strategy to select the most suitable synthetic samples, effectively augmenting
existing datasets to address class imbalance. We evaluate our method on two
downstream tasks-surgical action recognition and intra-operative event
prediction-demonstrating that incorporating synthetic videos from our approach
substantially enhances model performance. We open-source our implementation at
https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/surgvgen.

### [5] [Few-Shot Learning of Visual Compositional Concepts through Probabilistic Schema Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09859)
*Andrew Jun Lee,Taylor Webb,Trevor Bihl,Keith Holyoak,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSI模型通过结构化表示和类比映射，实现了人类视觉概念的快速学习，性能优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何从有限示例中学习视觉概念，强调结构化表示和类比映射的重要性。

Method: 提出Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI)模型，结合深度学习和类比映射，权衡对象和关系相似性。

Result: PSI表现接近人类学习能力，优于传统非结构化模型和弱结构化变体。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和类比映射是快速学习视觉概念的关键，深度学习可助力心理学模型开发。

Abstract: The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark
of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each
example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is
thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed
graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of
shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,
we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that
employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured
representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept
called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity
that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a
mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to
selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces
human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model
that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,
and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find
that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that
increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the
contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that
structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling
rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how
deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.

### [6] [Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09915)
*Zhe Xin,Chenyang Wu,Penghui Huang,Yanyong Zhang,Yinian Mao,Guoquan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSG-SLAM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的大规模视觉SLAM方法，使用立体相机，通过多模态策略和特征对齐约束提升鲁棒性，并在大规模场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF和3DGS方法多依赖RGBD传感器且仅适用于室内环境，大规模户外场景的鲁棒性重建尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用多模态策略估计初始位姿，引入特征对齐约束优化渲染损失，使用连续高斯泼溅子图处理无界场景，并通过位姿优化和结构细化模块提升重建质量。

Result: 在EuRoc和KITTI数据集上，LSG-SLAM性能优于现有神经、3DGS及传统方法。

Conclusion: LSG-SLAM为大规模户外场景的视觉SLAM提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM.
However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only
available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in
large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a
large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The
proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses
under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping
constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in
rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce
continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited
memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the
relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and
feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and
Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction
quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM
achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even
traditional approaches. Project page: https://lsg-slam.github.io.

### [7] [AdaptCLIP: Adapting CLIP for Universal Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09926)
*Bin-Bin Gao,Yue Zhu,Jiangtao Yan,Yuezhi Cai,Weixi Zhang,Meng Wang,Jun Liu,Yong Liu,Lei Wang,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptCLIP是一种简单有效的方法，通过交替学习视觉和文本表示，并结合上下文和对齐残差特征，显著提升了通用视觉异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提示模板设计、复杂令牌交互或额外微调方面存在局限性，AdaptCLIP旨在解决这些问题，提供更灵活的解决方案。

Method: AdaptCLIP基于两个关键洞察：交替学习视觉和文本表示，以及结合上下文和对齐残差特征的对比学习。它仅添加三个简单适配器，无需目标域微调。

Result: AdaptCLIP在12个工业和医学领域的异常检测基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AdaptCLIP通过简单适配器和训练自由的方式，实现了跨领域的零/少样本泛化，为视觉异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or
unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open
scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language
models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal
images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates,
complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in
limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method
called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual
representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second,
comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate
both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on
residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,
adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and
prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports
zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free
manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial
and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.
We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at
https://github.com/gaobb/AdaptCLIP.

### [8] [DDFP: Data-dependent Frequency Prompt for Source Free Domain Adaptation of Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09927)
*Siqi Yin,Shaolei Liu,Manning Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的源自由域适应（SFDA）框架，通过预适应生成高质量伪标签和数据依赖的频率提示，结合风格相关层微调策略，显著提升了跨模态医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私政策限制，医疗数据中标记源域数据的获取受限，现有SFDA方法在图像风格转换和伪标签质量上仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入预适应生成预适应模型，提出数据依赖频率提示用于风格转换，并采用风格相关层微调策略。

Result: 在跨模态腹部和心脏SFDA分割任务中，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了SFDA中的域差距问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the challenge of model performance degradation
caused by domain gaps. In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,
labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are
used to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,
particularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As
a result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation
(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and
unlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA
methods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and
self-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target
domain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images
and pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.
Moreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under
limited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to
address these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of
domain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to
generate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model
and allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without
introducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent
frequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a
source-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related
layer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target
model using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels. Extensive
experiments on cross-modality abdominal and cardiac SFDA segmentation tasks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: VRU-CIPI框架通过I2V通信技术提升路口安全性，为所有道路用户提供更顺畅和安全的交互。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban
intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road
users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable
Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts
with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a
sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at
intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal
dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer
self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical
for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving
real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by
integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach
can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of
crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring
smoother and safer interactions for all road users.

emergencies such as natural disasters, anthropogenic accidents, and military
strikes. First, in light of the limited discourse on the issue of
non-registration change detection, we systematically propose eight scenarios
that could arise in the real world and potentially contribute to the occurrence
of non-registration problems. Second, we develop distinct image transformation
schemes tailored to various scenarios to convert the available registration
change detection dataset into a non-registration version. Finally, we
demonstrate that non-registration change detection can cause catastrophic
damage to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轮廓感知和显著性先验嵌入的网络（CSPENet），用于红外小目标检测，解决了现有方法在定位模糊目标和密集杂波环境下轮廓信息感知不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在红外小目标检测中存在定位模糊目标和轮廓信息感知不足的缺陷，限制了检测性能。

Result: 在NUDT-SIRST、IRSTD-1k和NUAA-SIRST数据集上，CSPENet优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: CSPENet通过结合轮廓感知和显著性先验，显著提升了红外小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a critical role in a wide range
of civilian and military applications. Existing methods suffer from
deficiencies in the localization of dim targets and the perception of contour
information under dense clutter environments, severely limiting their detection
performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a contour-aware and saliency
priors embedding network (CSPENet) for ISTD. We first design a
surround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures
the intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging
toward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative
priors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and
multi-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail
representation. Building upon this, we propose a dual-branch priors embedding
architecture (DBPEA) that establishes differentiated feature fusion pathways,
embedding these two priors at optimal network positions to achieve performance
enhancement. Finally, we develop an attention-guided feature enhancement module
(AGFEM) to refine feature representations and improve saliency estimation
accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and
NUAA-SIRST demonstrate that our CSPENet outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods in detection performance. The code is available at
https://github.com/IDIP2025/CSPENet.

Result: 定量和区域评估显示，MambaControl在预测质量和解剖保真度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MambaControl在个性化预后和临床决策支持方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Modelling disease progression in precision medicine requires capturing
complex spatio-temporal dynamics while preserving anatomical integrity.
Existing methods often struggle with longitudinal dependencies and structural
consistency in progressive disorders. To address these limitations, we
introduce MambaControl, a novel framework that integrates selective state-space
modelling with diffusion processes for high-fidelity prediction of medical
image trajectories. To better capture subtle structural changes over time while
maintaining anatomical consistency, MambaControl combines Mamba-based
long-range modelling with graph-guided anatomical control to more effectively
represent anatomical correlations. Furthermore, we introduce Fourier-enhanced
spectral graph representations to capture spatial coherence and multiscale
detail, enabling MambaControl to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
Alzheimer's disease prediction. Quantitative and regional evaluations
demonstrate improved progression prediction quality and anatomical fidelity,
highlighting its potential for personalised prognosis and clinical decision
support.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于纹理关键驱动因素（TKDF）的新框架，通过纹理感知特征提取器和双上下文信息过滤，显著提升了野外面部表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外面部表情识别（FER）因表情特征的微妙性和局部性以及面部外观的复杂变化而具有挑战性。论文旨在通过关注纹理关键驱动因素（TKDF）来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种包含纹理感知特征提取器（TAFE）和双上下文信息过滤（DCIF）的架构。TAFE基于ResNet增强多分支注意力提取纹理特征，DCIF通过自适应池化和注意力机制优化特征。

Result: 在RAF-DB和KDEF数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，验证了TKDF在FER中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过关注局部纹理特征并结合上下文过滤，该方法显著提升了FER的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild remains a challenging task
due to the subtle and localized nature of expression-related features, as well
as the complex variations in facial appearance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework that explicitly focuses on Texture Key Driver Factors (TKDF),
localized texture regions that exhibit strong discriminative power across
emotional categories. By carefully observing facial image patterns, we identify
that certain texture cues, such as micro-changes in skin around the brows,
eyes, and mouth, serve as primary indicators of emotional dynamics. To
effectively capture and leverage these cues, we propose a FER architecture
comprising a Texture-Aware Feature Extractor (TAFE) and Dual Contextual
Information Filtering (DCIF). TAFE employs a ResNet-based backbone enhanced
with multi-branch attention to extract fine-grained texture representations,
while DCIF refines these features by filtering context through adaptive pooling
and attention mechanisms. Experimental results on RAF-DB and KDEF datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, verifying
the effectiveness and robustness of incorporating TKDFs into FER pipelines.

TL;DR: APCoTTA是一种针对ALS点云语义分割的连续测试时间适应方法，通过动态选择可训练层、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值机制，解决了领域偏移问题，并在两个新基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ALS点云分割中因环境变化、传感器类型或退化导致的模型性能下降问题，填补CTTA在该领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出动态可训练层选择模块、熵一致性损失和随机参数插值机制，以平衡目标适应和源知识保留。

Result: 在两个新基准ISPRSC和H3DC上，mIoU分别提升约9%和14%。

Conclusion: APCoTTA有效解决了ALS点云分割中的领域适应问题，并提供了新的基准和代码资源。

Abstract: Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task
for large-scale 3D scene understanding. In real-world applications, models are
typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the
environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in
model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by
adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.
Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing
challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of
catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To
tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for
ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer
selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select
low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we
propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on
entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing
model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation
mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers
with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation
and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we
construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA
benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate
that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU
improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference. The new
benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.

TL;DR: HQUIC是一种新型水下图像压缩算法，通过利用水下图像特有特征（如光线衰减和全局光信息）以及动态加权多尺度频率组件，显著提升了压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下图像压缩算法未能充分利用水下场景的独特性，导致性能不佳。HQUIC旨在通过针对性设计解决这一问题。

Method: HQUIC采用ALTC模块预测光线衰减系数和全局光信息，并利用代码本提取水下图像中的常见物体，同时动态加权多尺度频率组件以优化压缩效果。

Result: 在多个水下数据集上的评估表明，HQUIC优于现有最先进的压缩方法。

Conclusion: HQUIC通过针对性优化水下图像特征，显著提升了压缩性能，为水下图像的高效传输和存储提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing exploration and exploitation of the underwater world,
underwater images have become a critical medium for human interaction with
marine environments, driving extensive research into their efficient
transmission and storage. However, contemporary underwater image compression
algorithms fail to fully leverage the unique characteristics distinguishing
underwater scenes from terrestrial images, resulting in suboptimal performance.
To address this limitation, we introduce HQUIC, designed to exploit
underwater-image-specific features for enhanced compression efficiency. HQUIC
employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and
global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues
caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images.
Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the
common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the
main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency
components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while
discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression
methods.

TL;DR: PointArena是一个评估多模态指向能力的综合平台，包含数据集、交互式竞技场和机器人系统，测试显示Molmo-72B表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试仅关注对象定位任务，缺乏对多模态指向能力的全面评估。

Method: PointArena由三个组件组成：Point-Bench数据集、Point-Battle交互竞技场和Point-Act机器人系统。

Result: Molmo-72B表现最优，专有模型表现接近，针对指向任务的监督训练显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 精确的指向能力对多模态模型连接抽象推理与具体行动至关重要。

Abstract: Pointing serves as a fundamental and intuitive mechanism for grounding
language within visual contexts, with applications spanning robotics, assistive
technologies, and interactive AI systems. While recent multimodal models have
started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus
only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a
comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse
reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a
curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five
reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena
facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over
4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation
system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing
capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results
indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though
proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance.
Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing
tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage
evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the
critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to
effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

### [17] [Descriptive Image-Text Matching with Graded Contextual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09997)
*Jinhyun Jang,Jiyeong Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DITM的方法，通过探索语言的描述灵活性，学习图像与文本之间的分级上下文相似性，超越了传统的稀疏二元监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用稀疏二元监督，忽略了图像与文本之间固有的多对多关系，且未考虑从一般到具体描述的隐式连接。

Method: DITM利用句子描述性评分（基于TF-IDF）动态调整正负样本对的连接性，并构建通用到具体的句子对齐。

Result: 在MS-COCO、Flickr30K和CxC数据集上的实验表明，DITM在表示复杂图像-文本关系方面优于现有方法，并提升了模型的层次推理能力。

Conclusion: DITM通过灵活的监督机制和分级对齐策略，显著提升了图像-文本匹配的性能和表达能力。

Abstract: Image-text matching aims to build correspondences between visual and textual
data by learning their pairwise similarities. Most existing approaches have
adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and
sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited
subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many
correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different
descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit
connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying
rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In
this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn
the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the
descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of
each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the
sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust
image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,
dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and
(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a
generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM
enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.
Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the
hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive
analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.

Result: 通过实验和用户研究验证，该方法在逼真度和可用性上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动下一代消费平台上的大众化时尚设计。

Abstract: In the era of immersive consumer electronics, such as AR/VR headsets and
smart devices, people increasingly seek ways to express their identity through
virtual fashion. However, existing 3D garment design tools remain inaccessible
to everyday users due to steep technical barriers and limited data. In this
work, we introduce a 3D sketch-driven 3D garment generation framework that
empowers ordinary users - even those without design experience - to create
high-quality digital clothing through simple 3D sketches in AR/VR environments.
By combining a conditional diffusion model, a sketch encoder trained in a
shared latent space, and an adaptive curriculum learning strategy, our system
interprets imprecise, free-hand input and produces realistic, personalized
garments. To address the scarcity of training data, we also introduce
KO3DClothes, a new dataset of paired 3D garments and user-created sketches.
Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in both fidelity and usability, demonstrating
its promise for democratized fashion design on next-generation consumer
platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology is progressively transforming traditional car
driving methods, marking a significant milestone in modern transportation.
Object detection serves as a cornerstone of autonomous systems, playing a vital
role in enhancing driving safety, enabling autonomous functionality, improving
traffic efficiency, and facilitating effective emergency responses. However,
current technologies such as radar for environmental perception, cameras for
road perception, and vehicle sensor networks face notable challenges, including

reparameterization technology, a bidirectional pyramid structure network model,
and a novel detection pipeline into the YOLOv8 framework, the proposed approach
achieves highly efficient and precise detection of multi-scale, small, and
remote objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced model can
effectively detect both large and small objects with a detection accuracy of
65%, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods.This improved
model holds substantial potential for real-world applications and is
well-suited for autonomous driving competitions, such as the Formula Student
Autonomous China (FSAC), particularly excelling in scenarios involving
single-target and small-object detection.

Abstract: This paper does not describe a new method; instead, it provides a thorough
exploration of an important yet understudied design space related to recent
advances in text-to-image synthesis -- specifically, the deep fusion of large
language models (LLMs) and diffusion transformers (DiTs) for multi-modal
generation. Previous studies mainly focused on overall system performance
rather than detailed comparisons with alternative methods, and key design
details and training recipes were often left undisclosed. These gaps create
uncertainty about the real potential of this approach. To fill these gaps, we
conduct an empirical study on text-to-image generation, performing controlled
comparisons with established baselines, analyzing important design choices, and
providing a clear, reproducible recipe for training at scale. We hope this work

Abstract: Dynamic scene representation and reconstruction have undergone transformative
advances in recent years, catalyzed by breakthroughs in neural radiance fields
and 3D Gaussian splatting techniques. While initially developed for static
environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the
complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of
research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering,
these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion
representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial
attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey
presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene
representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural
representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate
these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms,
reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information
integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal
consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological
approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a
critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research
directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a
definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while
offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both
conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 普什图语的NLP面临挑战，如草书体脚本和数据集稀缺。为此，开发了PsOCR数据集以支持模型训练和评估。

Method: 创建了包含100万张图像的PsOCR数据集，涵盖多种字体、颜色和布局。评估了7个开源和4个闭源LMMs在10K基准子集上的表现。

Result: Gemini在所有模型中表现最佳，开源模型中Qwen-7B表现突出。

Conclusion: 本研究为普什图语OCR任务提供了LMMs的能力和局限性的评估，并为类似脚本的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the
cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address
this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one
million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document
levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different
architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.
PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes,
and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the
performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's
Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four
closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results
demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas
among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful
assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in
Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR
but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is
available at https://github.com/zirak-ai/PashtoOCR.

Result: 在Arcane和Pixar两种风格上验证了ToonifyGB的有效性，能够高效渲染具有任意表情的风格化虚拟形象。

Conclusion: ToonifyGB能够稳定生成高质量的风格化3D头部动画，并捕捉视频帧的高频细节。

Abstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time
reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a
StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization.
To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using
Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB.
In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to
generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the
limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for
normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables
Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video
frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In
Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head
model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By
combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can
efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the
effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane
and Pixar.

Result: 在15个数据集上表现优于现有方法，平衡了任务适应和泛化。

Conclusion: MMRL和MMRL++在少样本学习中显著提升了模型的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly
advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models
with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their
ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal
Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,
modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected
into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more
effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize
class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder
layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving
general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and
representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is
applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection
layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To
further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning
class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,
a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base
tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger
generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient
and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters
and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of
representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific
information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive
experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently
outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between
task-specific adaptation and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌修剪方法采用静态策略，忽略了任务间目标重要性的差异，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 基于Hausdorff距离推导误差界，利用ε-覆盖理论揭示目标间内在权衡，提出MoB框架，将修剪问题转化为双目标覆盖问题。

Result: MoB在LLaVA-1.5-7B上仅用11.1%的令牌保留96.4%性能，加速LLaVA-Next-7B 1.3-1.5倍，且适用于多种任务和模型。

Conclusion: MoB通过动态权衡目标，为视觉令牌修剪提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual
preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative
importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent
performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for
visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing
the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\epsilon$-covering
theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify
their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle
this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which
reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this
framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy
radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability
with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to
challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves
96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual
tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\times$ with negligible
performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm
that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language
tasks.

Result: 在临床4D-CT数据上实现了无伪影的实时重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下（如不规则呼吸）表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel image registration formalism dedicated to
the estimation of unknown condition-related images, based on two or more known
images and their associated conditions. We show how to practically model this
formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into
account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our
formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at
different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal
regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to
stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at
different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then
generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to
irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing
signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase
artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/Kheil-Z/IMITATE .

Conclusion: MCSAD通过协作风格增强和域不变学习，有效提升了模型在未见目标域上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from
multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target
domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain
generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore
the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style
information across existing source domains under the data decentralization
scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose
a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning
method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a
multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the
broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between
the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within
the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different
classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting
collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can
generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple
domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.

*Matthias Kümmerer,Harneet Khanuja,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型架构，通过少量数据集特定参数解决跨数据集显著性预测的性能下降问题，显著提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性预测模型在不同数据集间泛化能力差，性能下降显著，需解决数据集偏差问题。

Method: 扩展了数据集无关的编码器-解码器结构，引入少于20个数据集特定参数，控制多尺度结构、中心偏差和注视扩散等机制。

Result: 模型在MIT/Tuebingen显著性基准测试中达到新最优性能，泛化能力提升75%以上，仅需50个样本即可显著改进。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅提升了跨数据集性能，还揭示了空间显著性的复杂多尺度效应。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold
standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we
show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains
challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around
40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly,
increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with
close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining
generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly
dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific
parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure,
center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data
accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of
the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark
(MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from
unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the
respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into
spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine
both absolute and relative sizes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolE是一种基于移动设备驱动的3D重建框架，用于精确估计食物体积，无需参考对象或深度信息，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前食物体积估计方法受限于单核数据、专用硬件或依赖参考对象，VolE旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 利用AR移动设备捕获图像和相机位置，通过食物视频分割生成食物掩模，实现无参考和深度的3D重建。

Result: 实验显示VolE在多个数据集上表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差为2.22%。

Conclusion: VolE在食物体积估计中展现出卓越性能，为医疗营养管理和健康监测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for medical nutrition management
and health monitoring applications, but current food volume estimation methods
are often limited by mononuclear data, leveraging single-purpose hardware such
as 3D scanners, gathering sensor-oriented information such as depth
information, or relying on camera calibration using a reference object. In this
paper, we present VolE, a novel framework that leverages mobile device-driven
3D reconstruction to estimate food volume. VolE captures images and camera
locations in free motion to generate precise 3D models, thanks to AR-capable
mobile devices. To achieve real-world measurement, VolE is a reference- and
depth-free framework that leverages food video segmentation for food mask
generation. We also introduce a new food dataset encompassing the challenging
scenarios absent in the previous benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
VolE outperforms the existing volume estimation techniques across multiple
datasets by achieving 2.22 % MAPE, highlighting its superior performance in
food volume estimation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了医学图像分割模型在真实临床场景中性能下降的问题，提出通过MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强方法提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在真实临床环境中性能下降，传统数据增强方法无法应对多样化的分布偏移。

Method: 系统评估MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强方法，分析其对分布偏移的缓解效果。

Result: 这些方法显著提升了模型在心脏和前列腺MRI分割中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，并改善了特征表示。

Conclusion: 将MixUp和辅助傅里叶增强集成到nnU-Net训练流程中，为医学分割模型提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets,
leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical
settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data
augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges,
traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness
needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically
evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary
Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations
without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We
demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution
generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of
transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We
quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature
representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we
highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an
easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical
segmentation models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: MTVCrafter提出了一种基于4D运动序列的人类图像动画框架，通过4DMoT和MV-DiT技术，显著提升了动画的灵活性和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D姿态图像，限制了泛化能力并丢失了3D信息，因此需要直接建模3D运动序列以提升动画效果。

Method: 引入4DMoT将3D运动序列量化为4D运动令牌，并设计MV-DiT利用这些令牌进行动画生成。

Result: MTVCrafter在FID-VID指标上达到6.98，优于第二名65%，并展示了在多样化场景中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MTVCrafter为人类视频生成开辟了新方向，显著提升了动画质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly
due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely
largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits
generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.
To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video
Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences
(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT
(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.
Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust
spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image
and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we
introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention
with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as
4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D
world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new
direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our
MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98,
surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter
also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple,
full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios. Our video demos and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像人体网格恢复存在深度模糊和遮挡问题，现有概率方法在2D对齐和野外图像鲁棒性上表现不佳。

Method: 训练HMR-Scorer评估预测质量，构建偏好数据集，通过直接偏好优化微调基础模型。

Result: ADHMR在实验中优于现有方法，且HMR-Scorer能提升其他模型的性能。

Conclusion: ADHMR通过偏好优化解决了现有方法的不足，为人体网格恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single image is inherently ill-posed due to
depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods have tried to solve this
by generating numerous plausible 3D human mesh predictions, but they often
exhibit misalignment with 2D image observations and weak robustness to
in-the-wild images. To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that
Aligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First,
we train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of
evaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We
then use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has
a pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune
the base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also
helps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training
samples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at:

Motivation: 高精度地图（HD maps）是自动驾驶系统的关键组成部分，但传统方法依赖人工标注且在线地图面临时间一致性、传感器遮挡等问题。

Method: 整合来自自车和其他交通参与者的trail数据，使用Transformer模型构建全局地图，支持持续更新且传感器无关。

Result: 在两种基准数据集上验证，方法在泛化性和性能上优于现有在线地图方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了一种高效、鲁棒的地图构建解决方案。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps offer extensive and accurate environmental
information about the driving scene, making them a crucial and essential
element for planning within autonomous driving systems. To avoid extensive
efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have
emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping,
ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance
has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding
temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose
a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used
by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data
from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a
comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike
traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while
remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping
approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments
and sensor configurations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
highlighting its robustness and applicability in autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandReader，包含三种架构（RGB、KP、RGB+KP），用于手语拼写识别，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语拼写（fingerspelling）是手语的重要组成部分，但现有方法在视频时序处理上仍有改进空间。

Method: HandReader_RGB使用TSAM模块处理RGB特征；HandReader_KP基于TPE编码器处理关键点；HandReader_RGB+KP结合了两种模态。

Result: 在ChicagoFSWild、ChicagoFSWild+和Znaki数据集上均表现优异。

Conclusion: HandReader模型高效且准确，同时公开了Znaki数据集和预训练模型。

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a significant component of Sign Language (SL), allowing the
interpretation of proper names, characterized by fast hand movements during
signing. Although previous works on fingerspelling recognition have focused on
processing the temporal dimension of videos, there remains room for improving
the accuracy of these approaches. This paper introduces HandReader, a group of
three architectures designed to address the fingerspelling recognition task.
HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to
process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important
sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal
Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition
in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution
layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints
coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint
encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model
possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the
ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate
high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki,
presented in this paper. The Znaki dataset and HandReader pre-trained models
are publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches for marine fog detection and forecasting have
outperformed traditional methods, demonstrating significant scientific and
practical importance. However, the limited availability of open-source datasets
remains a major challenge. Existing datasets, often focused on a single region
or satellite, restrict the ability to evaluate model performance across diverse
conditions and hinder the exploration of intrinsic marine fog characteristics.
To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MFogHub}, the first
multi-regional and multi-satellite dataset to integrate annotated marine fog
observations from 15 coastal fog-prone regions and six geostationary
satellites, comprising over 68,000 high-resolution samples. By encompassing
diverse regions and satellite perspectives, MFogHub facilitates rigorous
evaluation of both detection and forecasting methods under varying conditions.
Extensive experiments with 16 baseline models demonstrate that MFogHub can
reveal generalization fluctuations due to regional and satellite discrepancy,
while also serving as a valuable resource for the development of targeted and
scalable fog prediction techniques. Through MFogHub, we aim to advance both the
practical monitoring and scientific understanding of marine fog dynamics on a
global scale. The dataset and code are at

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段跨模态交互（MSCI）模型，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层信息，增强对细粒度局部特征的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖CLIP的跨模态对齐能力，但忽视了其在细粒度局部特征捕捉上的局限性。

Method: 设计了两个自适应聚合器，分别从低层视觉特征提取局部信息和高层视觉特征整合全局信息，并通过分阶段交互机制逐步融入文本表示。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上验证了模型的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: MSCI通过动态调整全局与局部视觉信息的注意力权重，显著提升了模型对细粒度局部视觉信息的感知能力。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object
combinations by leveraging known combinations. Existing studies basically rely
on the cross-modal alignment capabilities of CLIP but tend to overlook its
limitations in capturing fine-grained local features, which arise from its
architectural and training paradigm. To address this issue, we propose a
Multi-Stage Cross-modal Interaction (MSCI) model that effectively explores and
utilizes intermediate-layer information from CLIP's visual encoder.
Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local
information from low-level visual features and integrate global information
from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are
progressively incorporated into textual representations through a
stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's
perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally,
MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual
information based on different combinations, as well as different elements
within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse
scenarios. Experiments on three widely used datasets fully validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Data and code are

Motivation: 视觉叙事系统常因跨帧角色身份不一致和动作与主体关联错误导致指代幻觉，需通过视觉元素实体接地解决。

Method: 构建包含4,178个故事的StoryReasoning数据集，使用视觉相似性和人脸识别进行跨帧实体重识别，结合链式推理和接地方案。

Result: 微调Qwen2.5-VL 7B得到的Qwen Storyteller模型将指代幻觉从4.06降至3.56（-12.3%）。

Conclusion: 通过结构化表示和跨帧实体接地，StoryReasoning和Qwen Storyteller有效减少视觉叙事中的指代幻觉。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems struggle to maintain character identity across
frames and link actions to appropriate subjects, frequently leading to
referential hallucinations. These issues can be addressed through grounding of
characters, objects, and other entities on the visual elements. We propose
StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie
images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story
maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly
modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations.
Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual
similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit
narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to
visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by
fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end
object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining
consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a
reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when
compared to a non-fine-tuned model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决mIF技术因成本和物流限制未广泛临床应用的问题，利用H&E图像预测mIF信号。

Method: 采用U-Net架构结合ViT编码器，训练于ORION数据集，验证于两个独立数据集。

Result: 在多个标记物上表现优异，如Pan-CK（F1=0.88），显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: MIPHEI为大规模H&E数据集的细胞类型分析提供了可行方案，有助于研究细胞空间组织与患者预后的关系。

Abstract: Histopathological analysis is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, with
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining routinely acquired for every patient to
visualize cell morphology and tissue architecture. On the other hand, multiplex
immunofluorescence (mIF) enables more precise cell type identification via
proteomic markers, but has yet to achieve widespread clinical adoption due to
cost and logistical constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI
(Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired
architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders
to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of
markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid),
epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using
the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from
colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI
achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of
0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,
substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random
classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively
captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue
context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell
types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis
of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between
spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.

Conclusion: PartCrop是一种有效的成员推理方法，适用于不同自监督模型，同时防御方法也能有效应对攻击。PartCrop-v2进一步提升了方法的实用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled
data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision.
In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models
in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are
unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system
in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be
trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image
modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a
unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the
shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the
training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to
query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive
attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and
structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the
effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against
PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential
privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The
defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides
prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we
quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in
a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two
structural improvements to PartCrop. Our code is at

Method: 设计了脉冲驱动的Hamming注意力（SDHA），并优化了空间-时间注意力设计，保持线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在视频分类、姿态跟踪和语义分割任务中达到SOTA性能，能效显著优于ANN方法。

Conclusion: SpikeVideoFormer展示了SNN在视频任务中的潜力，兼具高性能和高能效。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering
superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily
focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively
leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer,
featuring linear temporal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design
a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided
adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention.
Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention
designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for
video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The
generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across
diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking,
and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with
over 15\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the
performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency
gains, achieving $\times 16$, $\times 10$ and $\times 5$ improvements on the
three tasks. https://github.com/JimmyZou/SpikeVideoFormer

### [45] [Learned Lightweight Smartphone ISP with Unpaired Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10420)
*Andrei Arhire,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需对齐数据的训练方法，用于学习智能手机ISP，通过对抗训练和多判别器实现高质量RGB转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发学习型ISP时，获取对齐的RAW-RGB数据成本高且困难，因此需要一种无需配对数据的方法。

Method: 采用无配对训练策略，结合多损失函数和对抗训练，利用预训练网络的特征图保持内容结构。

Result: 在Zurich RAW to RGB和Fujifilm UltraISP数据集上表现优异，评估指标显示高保真度。

Conclusion: 无配对学习方法在智能手机ISP中具有潜力，适用于移动设备，且效果接近配对方法。

Abstract: The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern
smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB
images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the
potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with
a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and
costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise
aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to
high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by
proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need
for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with
matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function
guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature
maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning
color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using
lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as
backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm
UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning
strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple
evaluation metrics. The code and pre-trained models are available at

*Tyler Tran,Sangeet Khemlani,J. G. Trafton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对图像中虚拟对象的理解能力，发现现有模型在此方面的表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否真正理解图像中的空间关系，特别是对虚拟对象的处理能力。

Method: 通过设计包含虚拟对象的提示（如“想象树上卡了一只风筝”）来测试VLMs的场景理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前先进的VLMs在处理虚拟对象时表现不佳。

Conclusion: VLMs在理解图像中的虚拟对象和空间关系方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are AI systems paired with both language and
vision encoders to process multimodal input. They are capable of performing
complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open
question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes
depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual
objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help
test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that
depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt:
imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should
update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations
between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of
state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is
inadequate.

TL;DR: ControlGS是一种3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）优化方法，通过用户指定的超参数实现语义一致的数量-质量权衡，支持广泛调整范围，并在单次训练中自动适应不同场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3DGS中难以直观调整数量与渲染质量之间的权衡，无法满足实际需求（如不同硬件和通信限制下的模型部署）。

Method: 通过固定设置和用户指定的超参数，ControlGS在单次训练中自动寻找最优的数量-质量权衡点，支持跨场景一致的控制。

Result: ControlGS在减少高斯数量的同时保持高渲染质量，优于基线方法，并支持无级调整。

Conclusion: ControlGS提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，适用于从紧凑对象到大型户外场景的多样化需求。

Abstract: To reduce storage and computational costs, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) seeks
to minimize the number of Gaussians used while preserving high rendering
quality, introducing an inherent trade-off between Gaussian quantity and
rendering quality. Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality
performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this
trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse
hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS
optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene
consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality
performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a
user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS
can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across
diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also
outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer
Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the
trade-off.

Result: Logos数据集作为预训练模型在跨语言任务中表现优异，显著提升了低资源数据集的准确性。

Conclusion: Logos数据集和提出的方法在ISLR任务中优于现有技术，为手语识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition
(ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the
amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the
challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning.
Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to
ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for
annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a
novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by
the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the
largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model,
pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other
language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language
transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple
classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the
most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually
similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs
improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based
on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results
for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a
single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and
pre-trained models are publicly available.

Conclusion: UniEval为统一多模态模型提供了高效评估工具，揭示了其独特价值。

Abstract: The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is
rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance
instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However,
there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would
enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct
evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant
limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation
models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity,
and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework
designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or
annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The
UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both
unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore
metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity.
Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing
benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing
current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual
generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.

Abstract: We introduce CheXGenBench, a rigorous and multifaceted evaluation framework
for synthetic chest radiograph generation that simultaneously assesses
fidelity, privacy risks, and clinical utility across state-of-the-art
text-to-image generative models. Despite rapid advancements in generative AI
for real-world imagery, medical domain evaluations have been hindered by
methodological inconsistencies, outdated architectural comparisons, and
disconnected assessment criteria that rarely address the practical clinical
value of synthetic samples. CheXGenBench overcomes these limitations through
standardised data partitioning and a unified evaluation protocol comprising
over 20 quantitative metrics that systematically analyse generation quality,
potential privacy vulnerabilities, and downstream clinical applicability across
11 leading text-to-image architectures. Our results reveal critical
inefficiencies in the existing evaluation protocols, particularly in assessing
generative fidelity, leading to inconsistent and uninformative comparisons. Our
framework establishes a standardised benchmark for the medical AI community,
enabling objective and reproducible comparisons while facilitating seamless
integration of both existing and future generative models. Additionally, we
release a high-quality, synthetic dataset, SynthCheX-75K, comprising 75K
radiographs generated by the top-performing model (Sana 0.6B) in our benchmark
to support further research in this critical domain. Through CheXGenBench, we

Result: 在公开基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，提升了系统对脸部变形攻击的防御能力。

Conclusion: 该方法具有普适性，可集成到现有的人脸识别训练流程中，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Face recognition has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep
learning techniques, enabling its widespread adoption in various applications
requiring secure authentication. However, this progress has also increased its
exposure to presentation attacks, including face morphing, which poses a
serious security threat by allowing one identity to impersonate another.
Therefore, modern face recognition systems must be robust against such attacks.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach for training deep networks for face
recognition with enhanced robustness to face morphing attacks. Our method
modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification
strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs.
This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training
process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.
  Our strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks.
Furthermore, our approach is universally applicable and can be integrated into
existing face recognition training pipelines to improve classification-based
recognition methods.

Conclusion: 子模子集选择技术能有效解决多图像任务中的检索挑战，尤其在数据量大时表现突出。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in
vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented
with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering
scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images,
present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval
performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework
introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our
method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to
pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval
component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the
data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in
large haystack sizes.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估答案正确性，忽略了模型是否真正理解视觉输入，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来评估视觉理解能力。

Method: 通过解耦视觉和文本模态，分析注意力分布，提出注意力准确率指标和新基准，量化IVM。

Result: 研究发现注意力分布随网络层加深逐渐集中在正确答案相关的图像上，注意力准确率能可靠评估视觉理解。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅适用于多模态场景，还能扩展到单模态，具有广泛适用性和通用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements have enhanced the capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to comprehend multi-image information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models
genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit
visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without
fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the
visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing
that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with
the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the
introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a
novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the
model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to
positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our
approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal
scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型的发展，合成数据训练的图像质量提升，但仍存在不现实的图像。研究旨在验证可行性是否影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出VariReal管道，通过最小化编辑源图像生成可行或不可行属性，并测试其对CLIP分类器性能的影响。

Result: 可行性对CLIP性能影响极小（差异<0.3%），且混合可行与不可行数据对性能无显著影响。

Conclusion: 在合成数据训练中，强制要求可行性并非必要，混合数据不影响模型表现。

Abstract: With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in
part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,
diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in
reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture
artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a
synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic
images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered
infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered
out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a
model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be
excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility
really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is
necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,
focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We
introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to
include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated
by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally
affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference
in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute
matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the
classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in
training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using
purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

Abstract: Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large
Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate
details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving,
hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning.
To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal
alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate
corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two
modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset
with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,
FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.
Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures

ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on

Method: ETT利用视觉嵌入和标记器代码本，联合优化重建和标题生成目标，实现端到端调优。

Result: 实验表明，ETT在多模态理解和视觉生成任务中性能提升2-6%，同时保持原有重建能力。

Conclusion: ETT是一种简单有效的方法，有望在多模态基础模型中广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers
from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize
well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question
answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is
agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.
This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the
vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For
example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when
recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end
vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision
tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive
models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT
leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the
vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.
ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal
architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,
without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the
employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance
gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks
compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original
reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can
empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and
understanding.

Abstract: This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete
but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete
geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and
detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a
coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth
sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware
weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth
prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns,
enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a
conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise
of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and
prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth
sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth
completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets,
matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly,
it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time
improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.

Conclusion: 通过整合3D先验，3D-Fixup在图像编辑中取得了显著进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models,
3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only
specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a
new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework
supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D
rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses
the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes
real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training
data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a
single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,
we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this
challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We
design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout
training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup
effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving
high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in
realistic image manipulation. The code is provided at

*Xuechang Tu,Lukas Radl,Michael Steiner,Markus Steinberger,Bernhard Kerbl,Fernando de la Torre*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VRSplat结合并扩展了3DGS技术，解决了VR中的时间伪影、投影失真和帧率问题，通过改进的栅格化和优化步骤，实现了72+ FPS且无伪影的VR体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在VR中面临时间伪影、投影失真和帧率不足等问题，这些问题在头戴显示器（HMDs）中尤为突出。

Method: 结合Mini-Splatting、StopThePop和Optimal Projection技术，改进3DGS栅格化器，提出高效的中心凹栅格化器，并通过优化高斯参数。

Result: 用户研究显示VRSplat优于其他配置，实现了72+ FPS且消除了伪影和失真。

Conclusion: VRSplat是首个系统评估的3DGS方法，支持现代VR应用，解决了关键挑战。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for
novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient
software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time
applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS
faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as
popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in
disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when
rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for
VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by
large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of
head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine
and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR
holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal
Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques
and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated
rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch,
avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also
incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on
StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method
through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong
preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is
the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern
VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and
stereo-disrupting floaters.

*Peiying Zhang,Nanxuan Zhao,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段的SVG生成方法，结合了前馈T2V模型和T2I先验，解决了现有方法在风格定制和结构一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到矢量（T2V）生成方法缺乏风格定制能力，无法满足实际应用中一致视觉风格的需求。

Method: 提出两阶段流程：1）训练路径级表示的T2V扩散模型确保结构一致性；2）通过蒸馏定制T2I模型实现风格定制。

Result: 实验验证了该方法能高效生成高质量、多样化的定制风格SVG。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了前馈T2V和T2I先验，解决了风格定制和结构一致性的问题。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their
resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing
text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they
often overlook an important need in practical applications: style
customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics
with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing
T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.
Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)
models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.
On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,
yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to
limited SVG training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization
pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward
T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion
model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of
SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we
customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized
T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate
high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an
efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been
validated through extensive experiments. The project page is

### [61] [Next Word Suggestion using Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09649)
*Abisha Thapa Magar,Anup Shakya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图卷积网络（GNN）和LSTM的方法，用于语言建模中的上下文嵌入任务，并在资源有限的情况下验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型需要巨额计算资源和数据，本研究旨在探索一种资源高效的方法来解决上下文嵌入问题。

Method: 利用GNN的图卷积操作编码上下文，并与LSTM结合预测下一个词。实验基于自定义维基百科语料库，资源消耗较低。

Result: 该方法在有限资源下表现良好，能够有效预测下一个词。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合GNN和LSTM的方法在资源受限的语言建模任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Language Modeling is a prevalent task in Natural Language Processing. The
currently existing most recent and most successful language models often tend
to build a massive model with billions of parameters, feed in a tremendous
amount of text data, and train with enormous computation resources which
require millions of dollars. In this project, we aim to address an important
sub-task in language modeling, i.e., context embedding. We propose an approach
to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and
use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context
of preceding words. We test this on the custom Wikipedia text corpus using a
very limited amount of resources and show that this approach works fairly well
to predict the next word.

### [62] [DRA-GRPO: Exploring Diversity-Aware Reward Adjustment for R1-Zero-Like Training of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09655)
*Xiwen Chen,Wenhui Zhu,Peijie Qiu,Xuanzhao Dong,Hao Wang,Haiyu Wu,Huayu Li,Aristeidis Sotiras,Yalin Wang,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment (DRA)的方法，通过引入语义多样性改进GRPO在低资源语言模型后训练中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在低资源设置中表现良好，但其基于标量奖励信号的方法无法捕捉语义多样性，导致多样性-质量不一致问题。

Method: DRA利用Submodular Mutual Information (SMI)调整奖励，降低冗余补全的权重，增强多样性补全的奖励。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DRA-GRPO和DGA-DR.GRPO优于基线，平均准确率达58.2%，仅需7,000个微调样本和约55美元的训练成本。

Conclusion: DRA通过显式引入语义多样性，有效解决了GRPO的局限性，并在低资源设置中实现了最优性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training,
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in
low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and
scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled
completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality
inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable
rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward
Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity
into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to
downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This
encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable
exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with
both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and
$\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only
7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/DRA-GRPO.

TL;DR: 研究发现，前沿大语言模型（Claude Sonnet 3.5）在说服能力上显著优于激励人类说服者，无论是引导正确还是错误答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AI与人类在实时对话中的说服能力，评估AI在真实激励场景下的表现。

Method: 通过预注册的大规模激励实验，让参与者完成在线测试，AI或人类说服者尝试引导其选择正确或错误答案。

Result: AI说服者在引导正确和错误答案时均表现更优，显著影响参与者的准确性和收益。

Conclusion: AI的说服能力已超越激励人类，突显了对齐与治理框架的紧迫性。

Abstract: We directly compare the persuasion capabilities of a frontier large language
model (LLM; Claude Sonnet 3.5) against incentivized human persuaders in an
interactive, real-time conversational quiz setting. In this preregistered,
large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an
online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz
takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders
achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion
attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive
capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward
incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly
increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz
takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy,
leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers.
Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed
those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings
of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging
alignment and governance frameworks.

*Yumin Choi,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双层系统提示优化方法，通过元学习框架优化系统提示，使其能适应多样化的用户提示并迁移到未见任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注任务特定的用户提示优化，而忽略了通用的系统提示优化。本文旨在设计能适应多样化用户提示并可迁移到未见任务的系统提示。

Method: 采用元学习框架，通过在多数据集上迭代优化系统提示和用户提示，确保二者协同。

Result: 在14个未见数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优化的系统提示能快速适应新任务且性能提升。

Conclusion: 双层系统提示优化方法显著提升了LLM的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with
optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their
performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic
system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt
optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or
tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized,
applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce
the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to
design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable
to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning
framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various
user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user
prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct
experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we
show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to
diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system
prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer
optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved
performance.

### [65] [VeriFact: Enhancing Long-Form Factuality Evaluation with Refined Fact Extraction and Reference Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09701)
*Xin Liu,Lechen Zhang,Sheza Munir,Yiyang Gu,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriFact是一个新的事实性评估框架，旨在通过识别和解决不完整或缺失的事实来提高长文本生成的事实性评估准确性。同时，FactRBench基准测试首次同时评估精确率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估长文本生成的事实性时，常因忽略上下文和关键关系事实而效果不佳。

Method: 提出VeriFact框架，优化事实提取和验证流程；引入FactRBench基准测试，评估精确率和召回率。

Result: VeriFact显著提高了事实完整性和复杂关系的保留，FactRBench显示大模型在精确率和召回率上表现更好，但两者不一定相关。

Conclusion: VeriFact和FactRBench为长文本生成的事实性评估提供了更全面的工具，强调了综合评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating long-form responses, but
evaluating their factuality remains challenging due to complex inter-sentence
dependencies within the generated facts. Prior solutions predominantly follow a
decompose-decontextualize-verify pipeline but often fail to capture essential
context and miss key relational facts. In this paper, we introduce VeriFact, a
factuality evaluation framework designed to enhance fact extraction by
identifying and resolving incomplete and missing facts to support more accurate
verification results. Moreover, we introduce FactRBench , a benchmark that
evaluates both precision and recall in long-form model responses, whereas prior
work primarily focuses on precision. FactRBench provides reference fact sets
from advanced LLMs and human-written answers, enabling recall assessment.
Empirical evaluations show that VeriFact significantly enhances fact
completeness and preserves complex facts with critical relational information,
resulting in more accurate factuality evaluation. Benchmarking various open-
and close-weight LLMs on FactRBench indicate that larger models within same
model family improve precision and recall, but high precision does not always
correlate with high recall, underscoring the importance of comprehensive
factuality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析（如开放式回答、社交媒体帖子）耗时且易受偏见影响，LLMs为解决这一问题提供了潜力。

Method: 通过迭代和协作过程，结合预定义和数据驱动的分类法，利用LLMs生成、评估和应用分类法。

Result: 展示了如何通过提示生成生活领域分类法，并通过测试实现高编码一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本分析中具有潜力，但也存在局限性，需进一步探索。

Abstract: Analyzing texts such as open-ended responses, headlines, or social media
posts is a time- and labor-intensive process highly susceptible to bias. LLMs
are promising tools for text analysis, using either a predefined (top-down) or
a data-driven (bottom-up) taxonomy, without sacrificing quality. Here we
present a step-by-step tutorial to efficiently develop, test, and apply
taxonomies for analyzing unstructured data through an iterative and
collaborative process between researchers and LLMs. Using personal goals
provided by participants as an example, we demonstrate how to write prompts to
review datasets and generate a taxonomy of life domains, evaluate and refine
the taxonomy through prompt and direct modifications, test the taxonomy and
assess intercoder agreements, and apply the taxonomy to categorize an entire
dataset with high intercoder reliability. We discuss the possibilities and
limitations of using LLMs for text analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TokenAdapt框架，通过模型无关的tokenizer移植方法和多词Supertokens预分词学习，解决固定tokenization方案的低效问题，显著减少重新训练需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定tokenization方案在多语言或专业应用中效率低下且性能受限，现有方法计算资源消耗大且难以保留语义细节。

Method: 引入TokenAdapt（混合启发式初始化新token嵌入）和Supertokens预分词学习，结合局部子词分解和全局语义相似性估计。

Result: TokenAdapt在零样本困惑度测试中显著优于基线方法（如ReTok和TransTokenizer），困惑度比降低至少2倍。

Conclusion: TokenAdapt框架有效解决了tokenizer锁定的问题，同时减少了重新训练需求并提升了性能。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed
tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations,
particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer
lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this
often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer
replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing
methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully
preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression
inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a
model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel
pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and
reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a
hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword
decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the
top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This
methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing
retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions:
the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly
outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including
Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression
gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid
initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both
ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly
trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity
ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement
in these aggregate scores.

TL;DR: 该研究利用NLP技术（特别是NER）自动从电子健康记录中提取肺癌和乳腺癌的关键临床信息，使用uQuery工具和预训练的RoBERTa模型，取得了较高的准确性，但仍面临低频实体识别的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取临床报告信息耗时且易错，限制了医疗数据驱动方法的效率。NLP技术可自动化这一过程，提高数据提取的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用GMV的NLP工具uQuery和预训练的RoBERTa模型（bsc-bio-ehr-en3），通过NER技术从200份乳腺癌和400份肺癌报告中提取8种临床实体。

Result: 模型整体表现良好，尤其在识别MET和PAT等实体时效果显著，但对低频实体（如EVOL）的识别仍有挑战。

Conclusion: NLP技术（如NER）在自动化临床数据提取中具有潜力，可显著提高效率，但需进一步优化低频实体的识别能力。

Abstract: Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual
extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming
and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in
healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from
electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast
cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on
public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of
cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels
at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into
standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and
classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information,
including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In
this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity
Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical
information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health
Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast
cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities
manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the
bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained
in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture,
enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our
results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying
entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent
entities like EVOL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs中真理方向的泛化能力，尤其是在不同对话格式中的表现，以提升LLM谎言检测的可靠性。

Method: 通过线性探针分析LLMs的激活空间，测试真理方向在短对话和长对话中的泛化能力，并提出添加固定关键词短语的解决方案。

Result: 真理方向在短对话中泛化良好，但在长对话中表现不佳；添加固定关键词短语显著改善了长对话中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM谎言检测在新场景中泛化的挑战，并提出了一种有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where
true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the
model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden
state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even
be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how
this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We
find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but
poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the
input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of
generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.
Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that
generalize to new settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补大语言模型在文学细读评估上的空白，验证其是否具备大学水平的细读能力。

Method: 设计了三个逐步困难的任务集：提取文体特征、检索上下文信息、多跳推理，测试LLMs的表现。

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在细读任务中表现尚可（准确率49.7%-69.7%），但仍落后于人类评估者。

Conclusion: LLMs在文学细读中展现出一定能力，但与人类仍有差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level
English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts
through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details
to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for
critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university
coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models
(LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as
a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading
benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331
multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we
propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate
different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well
LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting
stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from
parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external
contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess
some college-level close reading competency (accuracy 49.7% - 69.7%), their
performances still trail those of experienced human evaluators on 10 out of our
11 tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言任务中表现优异，但其在冲突预测中的应用尚未充分探索，这对早期预警系统和政策制定至关重要。

Method: 通过参数化（仅预训练权重）和非参数化（结合外部冲突数据集和新闻）两种方法，评估LLMs在2020-2024年冲突频发地区的预测能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在冲突预测中具有一定能力，但结合外部知识能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LLMs在冲突预测中具有潜力，但需结合外部知识以弥补预训练权重的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural
language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains
underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric
knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation
and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning
systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric
knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and
unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent
news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external
information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context
otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework
spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the
Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and
fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting,
models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and
geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g.,
Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against
historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs
for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured
external knowledge.

Conclusion: 实现西班牙语的本地化变体有助于提升AI模型的用户信任和文化意识，同时促进可持续的用户增长。

Abstract: Large language models are, by definition, based on language. In an effort to
underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines
primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America
and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization
therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant
gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating
sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models
would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach
informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to
more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily
user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的兴起，AI生成文本的滥用问题日益严重，水印技术成为潜在解决方案。现有水印方法在鲁棒性、文本质量和安全性之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出了一种混合水印框架，结合logits-based和sampling-based方法，利用三种策略（串行、并行、混合）和基于token熵与语义熵的自适应嵌入方式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集和模型上优于现有基线，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为多样化水印范式提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the
misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution.
Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based
and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among
robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate
logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths
to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic
watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The
hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic
entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text
quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through
comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel
insights into diverse watermarking paradigms. Our code is available at

TL;DR: MePO是一种基于可解释设计的轻量级提示优化器，通过模型无关的提示质量指标改进提示和响应质量，适用于各种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖大型LLM生成提示，但可能导致轻量级模型性能下降，因此需要一种更通用且高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出MePO，基于轻量级LLM生成的偏好数据集，学习可解释的提示质量指标，实现本地部署和离线优化。

Result: 实验表明MePO在多种任务和模型上表现优异，具有可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MePO提供了一种高效、通用的提示优化解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Prompt optimization (PO) offers a practical alternative to fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), enabling performance improvements without altering
model weights. Existing methods typically rely on advanced, large-scale LLMs
like GPT-4 to generate optimized prompts. However, due to limited downward
compatibility, verbose, instruction-heavy prompts from advanced LLMs can
overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality. In this
work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of interpretable design.
We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically
validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then
introduce MePO, a merit-guided, lightweight, and locally deployable prompt
optimizer trained on our preference dataset built from merit-aligned prompts
generated by a lightweight LLM. Unlike prior work, MePO avoids online
optimization reliance, reduces cost and privacy concerns, and, by learning
clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and
lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better
results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust
solution for real-world deployment. Our model and dataset are available at:

*Deeksha Prahlad,Chanhee Lee,Dongha Kim,Hokeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的检索增强生成（RAG）方法，以解决大型语言模型（LLM）在生成个性化响应时因缺乏及时、真实和个性化信息而导致的幻觉问题。实验表明，该方法在理解个人信息和生成准确响应方面优于基线LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成响应时容易因过拟合而产生错误或多余信息（幻觉），主要原因是缺乏及时、真实和个性化的输入数据。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）结合知识图谱（KG），利用KG结构化存储和更新个性化数据（如日历信息），辅助LLM生成更准确的响应。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在理解个人信息和生成准确响应方面显著优于基线LLM，且响应时间略有减少。

Conclusion: 结合KG的RAG方法能有效减少LLM的幻觉问题，提升个性化响应的准确性。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications,
including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and
other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs
often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra
and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of
the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and
personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response
generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing
continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can
be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar,
contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our
experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in
understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared
to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate
reduction in response time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的隐含偏见不仅是伦理问题，也是技术问题，但目前缺乏标准化的衡量方法。

Method: 开发了DIF（Demographic Implicit Fairness）方法，通过评估LLM在逻辑和数学问题数据集上的表现，结合社会人口统计角色进行分析。

Result: 实验统计验证了LLM行为中存在隐含偏见，并发现问题回答准确性与隐含偏见呈负相关。

Conclusion: DIF方法为LLM隐含偏见的标准化评估提供了可行方案，并揭示了其技术局限性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen in prominence over the past few
years, there has been concern over the potential biases in LLMs inherited from
the training data. Previous studies have examined how LLMs exhibit implicit
bias, such as when response generation changes when different social contexts
are introduced. We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but
also a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate
extraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence,
there are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To
bridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable
benchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM
logic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas. We demonstrate
that this method can statistically validate the presence of implicit bias in
LLM behavior and find an inverse trend between question answering accuracy and
implicit bias, supporting our argument.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAFE的两阶段方法，通过粗到细的过滤和引导机制，提升大语言模型在多文档问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型的输入上下文长度有所提升，但在长上下文输入中的检索和推理能力仍有不足，现有方法在平衡检索精度和召回率方面存在挑战。

Method: CAFE采用两阶段方法：粗粒度过滤识别相关文档并排序，细粒度引导将注意力集中在最相关内容上。

Result: 实验表明，CAFE在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，在Mistral模型上分别比SFT和RAG方法提升了22.1%和13.7%的SubEM分数。

Conclusion: CAFE通过逐步消除背景和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提升了多文档问答的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their input
context length, yet they still struggle with retrieval and reasoning in
long-context inputs. Existing methods propose to utilize the prompt strategy
and retrieval head to alleviate this limitation. However, they still face
challenges in balancing retrieval precision and recall, impacting their
efficacy in answering questions. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{CAFE}$,
a two-stage coarse-to-fine method to enhance multi-document question-answering
capacities. By gradually eliminating the negative impacts of background and
distracting documents, CAFE makes the responses more reliant on the evidence
documents. Initially, a coarse-grained filtering method leverages retrieval
heads to identify and rank relevant documents. Then, a fine-grained steering
method guides attention to the most relevant content. Experiments across
benchmarks show CAFE outperforms baselines, achieving up to 22.1% and 13.7%
SubEM improvement over SFT and RAG methods on the Mistral model, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其潜在的越狱攻击风险日益凸显，尤其是那些未经伦理约束或通过越狱技术修改的模型，可能被滥用生成有害内容。

Method: 研究团队发现了一种通用越狱攻击方法，能够绕过多个先进LLMs的安全控制，使其生成有害输出。

Result: 测试显示，许多LLMs在攻击发布七个月后仍存在漏洞，且主要LLM提供商的应对措施不足。

Conclusion: 随着LLMs的普及和开源化，其滥用风险加剧，亟需行业采取更有效的安全措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields
from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable
capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to
jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems
from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes
unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn
undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their
intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by
dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified
through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal
jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models,
enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon
request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months
ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack.
Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers
were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices
regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and
as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates.
Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to
dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.

Motivation: 探究预训练语言模型在非洲语言中的语言学知识编码机制，以理解其性能提升的原因。

Method: 通过分层探测器和控制任务分析六种非洲语言的PLMs，使用MasakhaPOS数据集评估性能。

Result: 适应非洲语言的PLMs比多语言PLMs编码更多语言学信息，句法信息集中在中后层，语义信息分布在各层。

Conclusion: 研究证实了PLMs内部知识的有效性，并揭示了适应策略（如主动学习和多语言适应）的成功机制。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) for African languages are continually
improving, but the reasons behind these advances remain unclear. This paper
presents the first systematic investigation into probing PLMs for linguistic
knowledge about African languages. We train layer-wise probes for six
typologically diverse African languages to analyse how linguistic features are
distributed. We also design control tasks, a way to interpret probe
performance, for the MasakhaPOS dataset. We find PLMs adapted for African
languages to encode more linguistic information about target languages than
massively multilingual PLMs. Our results reaffirm previous findings that
token-level syntactic information concentrates in middle-to-last layers, while
sentence-level semantic information is distributed across all layers. Through
control tasks and probing baselines, we confirm that performance reflects the
internal knowledge of PLMs rather than probe memorisation. Our study applies
established interpretability techniques to African-language PLMs. In doing so,
we highlight the internal mechanisms underlying the success of strategies like
active learning and multilingual adaptation.

TL;DR: XRAG是一个新颖的基准测试，用于评估LLM在跨语言检索增强生成（RAG）中的生成能力，特别是在用户语言与检索结果不匹配的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，用户语言与检索结果不匹配的情况常见，但现有基准测试未能充分覆盖这一复杂性。

Method: XRAG基于近期新闻文章构建，确保问题需要外部知识回答，并提供相关文档的标注。

Result: 实验发现，在单语言检索中，模型难以保证回答语言正确；在多语言检索中，主要挑战在于跨语言信息的推理。

Conclusion: XRAG为研究LLM推理能力提供了有价值的基准，揭示了跨语言RAG中的新挑战。

Abstract: We propose XRAG, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the generation
abilities of LLMs in cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
settings where the user language does not match the retrieval results. XRAG is
constructed from recent news articles to ensure that its questions require
external knowledge to be answered. It covers the real-world scenarios of
monolingual and multilingual retrieval, and provides relevancy annotations for
each retrieved document. Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in
questions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap
between human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable
benchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the
additional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover
two previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the
monolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response
language correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main
challenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather
than generation of non-English text.

Method: 使用S-MedQA数据集，分析不同专业领域微调对模型性能的影响，并观察临床相关术语的概率变化。

Result: 1) 专业领域微调不一定带来最佳性能；2) 所有专业的临床相关术语概率均增加。

Conclusion: 改进主要来自领域转换而非知识注入，建议重新思考医学领域微调数据的作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering
(QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models in fine-grained clinical
specialties. We use S-MedQA to check the applicability of a popular hypothesis
related to knowledge injection in the knowledge-intense scenario of medical QA,
and show that: 1) training on data from a speciality does not necessarily lead
to best performance on that specialty and 2) regardless of the specialty
fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms for all
specialties increase consistently. Thus, we believe improvement gains come
mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than knowledge
injection and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical
domain. We release S-MedQA and all code needed to reproduce all our experiments
to the research community.

Motivation: LLMs在决策辅助中常因幻觉回答和不可靠输出引发信任问题，需手动验证。

Method: 结合知识图谱构建检索增强代理，利用CoT逻辑生成、n跳子图搜索和蕴含式句子生成实现精准证据检索。

Result: 方法在自由上下文中准确识别证据，提升模型性能，帮助判断LLM结论的可信度。

Conclusion: GE-Chat通过证据增强生成，为LLM输出的可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models are now key assistants in human decision-making
processes. However, a common note always seems to follow: "LLMs can make
mistakes. Be careful with important info." This points to the reality that not
all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually.
The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly
plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among
users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph
enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based
response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a
knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented
agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its
training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation,
n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize
accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the
existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a
free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's
conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.

<details>

Motivation: 当前监督微调和强化学习方法在推理任务中受限于特定领域，而持续预训练（CPT）无需任务特定信号，但其在推理任务中的应用和数据合成效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Reasoning CPT方法，利用合成数据重建文本背后的隐藏思维过程，应用于Gemma2-9B模型，并与标准CPT在MMLU基准上对比。

Result: Reasoning CPT在所有评估领域均提升性能，尤其在难题上表现更优（提升达8分），且推理能力可跨领域迁移。

Conclusion: Reasoning CPT通过调整推理深度适应问题难度，显著提升模型性能，展示了跨领域推理的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are
primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,
which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of
training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of
not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively
synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of
domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of
Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden
thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the
result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT
to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and
Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis
reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all
evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer
effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as
problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most
challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to
adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of
modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies
underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have
attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches
are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of
model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up
framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically
extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into
a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives
contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show
that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than
existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables
performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and
guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical
insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs.
multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data
domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因大词汇量导致的输出层参数和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 用小型共享码本替代大型输出嵌入矩阵，预测码本上的logits并映射到完整词汇空间。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，参数减少99%，计算速度提升6倍，困惑度仅增加4%。

Conclusion: VQ-Logits是一种高效且稳健的方法，显著优化了LLM输出层的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face
significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their
extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping
hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial
portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference.
Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce
structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach
that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter
count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the
large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K
embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of
these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,
which are then efficiently "scattered" to the full vocabulary space using the
learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits
can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in
logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to
full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on
codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the
robustness and effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: RAIDEN-R1填补了RPCA训练中的量化空白，为角色感知推理模式提供了新见解。

Abstract: Role-playing conversational agents (RPCAs) face persistent challenges in
maintaining role consistency. To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness
Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining
strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset
through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning
coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's
superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on
Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively,
outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses
further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual
cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the
non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware
reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)
systems, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential
for diverse applications, including tasks requiring nuanced textual
understanding and contextual reasoning. This study investigates the
capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLAMA3,
Mistral 7B, and Claude-2 - for zero-shot and few-shot annotation of a complex
textual dataset comprising social media posts in Russian and Ukrainian.
Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying
references to human rights violations within the dataset.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared
against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000
samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different
prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian.
Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and
disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths,
limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.
  By juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes
to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive,
domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how
language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a
critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Quicker是一种基于大型语言模型的临床决策支持系统，旨在自动化证据合成并生成临床建议，显著提高决策效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床证据整合到实时实践中存在挑战，如工作量大、流程复杂和时间限制，因此需要自动化工具支持高效准确的决策。

Method: Quicker采用全自动化流程，覆盖从问题到临床建议的所有阶段，并通过交互界面支持定制化决策。

Result: 实验显示Quicker在问题分解、文献筛选和推荐生成方面表现优异，协作模式下将推荐时间缩短至20-40分钟。

Conclusion: Quicker能帮助医生更快、更可靠地做出基于证据的临床决策。

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides
healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed
decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is
challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and
time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence
synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical
settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision
support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate
evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard
clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated
chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and
further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and
interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed
the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development
records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted
Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored
to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and
literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of
relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively
supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more
comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level
testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time
required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our
findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and
more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: J1是一种通过强化学习训练LLM-as-a-Judge模型的方法，优于现有8B和70B模型，并在某些基准测试中超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI评估质量是瓶颈，LLM-as-a-Judge模型通过链式思维推理提升判断能力，需要找到最佳训练方法。

Method: 使用强化学习将可验证和不可验证提示转换为带奖励的判断任务，激励思维并减少偏见。

Result: J1在8B和70B规模上优于其他模型，甚至在某些基准测试中超越更大模型。

Conclusion: J1通过强化学习显著提升LLM-as-a-Judge模型的判断能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, and powerful
LLM-as-a-Judge models have proved to be a core solution. Improved judgment
ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need
to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we
introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our
method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks
with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias.
In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models
when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1
also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a
smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs
Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies,
seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our
models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria,
comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the
correctness of model responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入方法（如SimCSE和LLM2Vec）性能优秀但难以解释，而经典稀疏嵌入（如词袋模型）性能较差。需要一种既能保持高性能又具备可解释性的方法。

Method: 提出LDIR方法，通过最远点采样生成低维（小于500维）密集嵌入，数值维度表示与不同锚文本的语义相关性。

Result: 在多个语义文本相似性、检索和聚类任务中，LDIR表现接近黑盒基线模型，且优于其他可解释嵌入方法。

Conclusion: LDIR在保持高性能的同时提供了可解释性，为语义文本表示提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural
language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have
demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are
difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable
embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024)
propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms
"0/1" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These
interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than
10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and
Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The
numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different
anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic
representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability.
We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and
clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close
to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings
baselines with much fewer dimensions. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类思维本质上是多模态的，而现有研究多局限于单模态输入，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型（VLMs），结合模态特定专家，共同解析多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与最先进系统相当，同时更具适应性和扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了更具生态效度和普适性的思维解码技术。

Abstract: Decoding thoughts from brain activity offers valuable insights into human
cognition and enables promising applications in brain-computer interaction.
While prior studies have explored language reconstruction from fMRI data, they
are typically limited to single-modality inputs such as images or audio. In
contrast, human thought is inherently multimodal. To bridge this gap, we
propose a unified and flexible framework for reconstructing coherent language
from brain recordings elicited by diverse input modalities-visual, auditory,
and textual. Our approach leverages visual-language models (VLMs), using
modality-specific experts to jointly interpret information across modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art systems while remaining adaptable and extensible. This work
advances toward more ecologically valid and generalizable mind decoding.

Abstract: This paper explores the design of an aspect-based sentiment analysis system
using large language models (LLMs) for real-world use. We focus on quadruple
opinion extraction -- identifying aspect categories, sentiment polarity,
targets, and opinion expressions from text data across different domains and
languages. Using internal datasets, we investigate whether a single fine-tuned
model can effectively handle multiple domain-specific taxonomies
simultaneously. We demonstrate that a combined multi-domain model achieves
performance comparable to specialized single-domain models while reducing
operational complexity. We also share lessons learned for handling
non-extractive predictions and evaluating various failure modes when developing
LLM-based systems for structured prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语法的解码方法RPG，用于解决代码生成中的结构重复问题，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型在代码生成中表现优异，但重复问题（尤其是结构重复）仍然存在，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: RPG利用语法规则识别重复问题，并通过衰减关键标记的似然来减少重复。

Result: RPG在CodeRepetEval、HumanEval和MBPP基准测试中显著优于基线方法，有效减少重复并提升代码质量。

Conclusion: RPG是一种高效的解码方法，能够显著缓解代码生成中的结构重复问题。

Abstract: With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation
has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the
generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on
content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition
problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is
structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in
various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently
reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition
and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for
Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems
in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to
identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically
decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,
thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we
construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches
for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the
best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and
MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of
generated code.

*Yue Guo,Jae Ho Sohn,Gondy Leroy,Trevor Cohen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的简明语言摘要（PLS）在主观评价中与人工编写的PLS难以区分，但在理解效果上人工编写的PLS更优。自动评估指标与人类判断不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成PLS的有效性和评估方法的不足，尤其是直接衡量理解性的缺失。

Method: 通过大规模众包评估（150名参与者），结合主观评分（简洁性、信息性、连贯性、忠实性）和客观理解测试（多选题）。

Result: LLM生成的PLS在主观评分上与人工编写的PLS无显著差异，但在理解测试中人工编写的PLS表现更好。自动评估指标与人类判断不一致。

Conclusion: 需要开发超越表面质量的评估框架，并优化生成方法以提升普通人的理解效果。

Abstract: Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective
communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical
information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language
models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but
their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains
unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do
not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from
convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we
conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using
Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through
subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,
coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and
recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the
alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our
findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear
indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,
human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,
automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into
question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to
systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and
comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation
frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods
that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.

Motivation: 解决长文本RAG应用中冗余信息和噪声导致的高推理成本和性能下降问题。

Method: 采用双级查询分析、分层文档结构和基于多任务学习的自适应优化，利用单一基础模型实现。

Result: 在七个QA数据集上表现优异，计算成本和延迟降低10倍。

Conclusion: LongRefiner具有可扩展性、高效性和实用性，为长文本RAG应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world RAG applications often encounter long-context input scenarios,
where redundant information and noise results in higher inference costs and
reduced performance. To address these challenges, we propose LongRefiner, an
efficient plug-and-play refiner that leverages the inherent structural
characteristics of long documents. LongRefiner employs dual-level query
analysis, hierarchical document structuring, and adaptive refinement through
multi-task learning on a single foundation model. Experiments on seven QA
datasets demonstrate that LongRefiner achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while using 10x fewer computational costs and latency
compared to the best baseline. Further analysis validates that LongRefiner is
scalable, efficient, and effective, providing practical insights for real-world
long-text RAG applications. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DCoLT是一种用于扩散语言模型的推理框架，通过逆向扩散过程的中间步骤作为潜在“思考”动作，并利用基于结果的强化学习优化整个推理轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Chain-of-Thought方法具有因果线性思维限制，DCoLT旨在实现双向非线性推理，突破中间步骤的语法限制。

Method: 在两种扩散语言模型（SEDD和LLaDA）上实现DCoLT，分别通过概率策略和基于排名的解掩码策略优化强化学习奖励。

Result: 实验表明，DCoLT增强的模型在数学和代码生成任务中表现优于其他方法，LLaDA在多个任务中准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: DCoLT通过优化推理轨迹，显著提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a
reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each
intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking"
action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on
the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal,
linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with
no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of
thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete
diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to
maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion
steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model --
LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential
role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking
Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both
math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800
GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even
both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%,
+5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法直接使用检索文档，但文档质量参差不齐，影响模型训练效果。受人类认知学习启发，提出课程学习框架。

Method: 构建多难度训练数据，分阶段训练检索器和生成器。

Result: 在四个开放域QA数据集上性能提升2%至4%。

Conclusion: CL-RAG有效提升RAG系统性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method to enhance the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on
optimizing the retriever or generator in the RAG system by directly utilizing
the top-k retrieved documents. However, the documents effectiveness are various
significantly across user queries, i.e. some documents provide valuable
knowledge while others totally lack critical information. It hinders the
retriever and generator's adaptation during training. Inspired by human
cognitive learning, curriculum learning trains models using samples progressing
from easy to difficult, thus enhancing their generalization ability, and we
integrate this effective paradigm to the training of the RAG system. In this
paper, we propose a multi-stage Curriculum Learning based RAG system training
framework, named CL-RAG. We first construct training data with multiple
difficulty levels for the retriever and generator separately through sample
evolution. Then, we train the model in stages based on the curriculum learning
approach, thereby optimizing the overall performance and generalization of the
RAG system more effectively. Our CL-RAG framework demonstrates consistent
effectiveness across four open-domain QA datasets, achieving performance gains
of 2% to 4% over multiple advanced methods.

Motivation: 现有代码安全基准仅关注单一任务，缺乏多维度评估，需全面衡量LLM在代码安全方面的表现。

Method: 提出CoV-Eval多任务基准和VC-Judge评估模型，对20种LLM进行综合评估。

Result: LLM能较好识别漏洞代码，但在生成安全代码和修复漏洞方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM代码安全的关键挑战，为未来优化提供了方向。

Abstract: Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant
applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security
benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code
completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions
like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this
paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks
such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and
classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we
developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human
experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more
efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable
codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with
recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive
experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization
directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.

Motivation: 在跨语言迁移的标记分类任务中，标签投影是关键步骤，但现有方法（如词对齐器和标记方法）的设计选择未得到系统研究。

Method: 系统研究了词对齐器在标签投影中的低层设计选择（如标签投影算法、过滤策略和预标记化），并提出了集成翻译-训练和翻译-测试预测的新策略。

Conclusion: 通过优化设计选择和引入集成策略，基于翻译的跨语言迁移在标记分类任务中表现更优且更稳健。

Abstract: Translation-based strategies for cross-lingual transfer XLT such as
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- and translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language
data translated from the target language -- are competitive XLT baselines. In
XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label
projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the
original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word
aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design
decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been
systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which
project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)
translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,
we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects
of low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for
projecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to
reduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of
the translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact
translation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT
with WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.
We then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and
translate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms
the marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling
also reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more
robust XLT for token classification tasks.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving
language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized
to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a
simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves
learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting
future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key
advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters,
requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf
pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining
objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning.
Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases,
including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and
pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision
domains. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/nasosger/MuToR.

Motivation: 受语言模型中测试损失与模型和数据规模呈幂律关系的启发，探索偏好建模中的类似规律。

Method: 收集公共论坛的偏好数据，使用1.5B至72B参数的模型进行大规模训练，分析不同评估指标的扩展行为。

Result: 发现对抗性和客观性指标随规模扩展，而主观性指标无此趋势；WorldPM在多个基准任务中提升泛化性能5%以上。

Conclusion: WorldPM作为偏好微调基础表现优异，显著提升RLHF管道的评估结果。

Abstract: Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss
scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws
exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM)
to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified
representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data
from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive
training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B
parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics:
(1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently
scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective
metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior
in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3)
Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or
AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the
effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly
improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of
varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5%
on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we
observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets,
with notable gains of 4% to 8% in our in-house evaluations.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long
chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning
behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena
often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and
consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and
uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning
capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts
and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three
meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically
generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual
alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning,
boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines.
Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an
additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and
science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a
scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning. Code is available at:

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item
data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance
recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs)
introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context
learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language
models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities
but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility.
This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection
of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and
data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise
integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related
recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets,
and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of
LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly
evolving field.

### [105] [Predictability Shapes Adaptation: An Evolutionary Perspective on Modes of Learning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09855)
*Alexander Y. Ku,Thomas L. Griffiths,Stephanie C. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer模型的两种学习模式（IWL和ICL），通过类比进化生物学中的遗传编码和表型可塑性，探讨了环境可预测性对这两种模式平衡的影响。实验表明，高稳定性偏好IWL，而高线索可靠性增强ICL。学习动态还揭示了任务依赖的时序演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer模型中IWL和ICL的交互作用，借鉴进化生物学的策略，探究环境可预测性如何影响这两种学习模式的平衡。

Method: 通过回归和分类任务，实验操作化环境可预测性的维度，系统研究其对IWL/ICL平衡的影响。

Result: 高环境稳定性显著偏好IWL，高线索可靠性增强ICL。学习动态显示任务依赖的时序演变，如ICL到IWL的转变或初始IWL后ICL主导。

Conclusion: 可预测性是决定Transformer中学习模式平衡的关键因素，支持相对成本假说，为理解ICL和优化训练方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL),
encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting
flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the
interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary
biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,
adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and
phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to
environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability
dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic
encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We
experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and
systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in
Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high
environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp
transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL
efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics
reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift
occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we
demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL
acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding
to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for
explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a
critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering
novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在动态决策任务中是否表现出与人类相似的探索-利用权衡行为，并评估其性能。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机任务和可解释的选择模型，比较LLMs、人类和算法的决策策略，分析推理能力对LLMs行为的影响。

Result: 推理使LLMs在简单任务中表现出类似人类的随机和定向探索，但在复杂环境中适应性较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类行为和自动化决策方面有潜力，但在复杂环境中的适应性仍需改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate
human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question
is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and
can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the
exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic
decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB)
tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct
a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms.
We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents
and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and
reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning
shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random
and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs
exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans.
However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match
human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite
achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the
promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for
automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法和机器学习模型难以捕捉事故中复杂因素的交互作用，因此研究探索LLM在事故原因分析中的应用。

Method: 使用QLoRA对Llama3 8B模型进行微调，基于226项高速公路事故研究构建训练数据集，通过零样本分类识别事故原因。

Result: LLM能有效识别酒驾、超速、攻击性驾驶和注意力分散等主要事故原因，并结合事件数据提供更深入分析，研究者认可度达88.89%。

Conclusion: LLM为交通事故原因分析提供了新工具，有助于制定更有效的交通安全措施。

Abstract: Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing
strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical
methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex
interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each
crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway
crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226
traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset
encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was
created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its
understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in
these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash
causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing
comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable
and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively
identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,
aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as
road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical
applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated
by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety,
as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the
complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive
analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it
provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and
policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety
practices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MiCo的分层语言代理框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）设计启发式方法，解决云服务中的动态多维装箱问题（ODMBP）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法难以适应实时变化，启发式方法策略僵化，现有学习方法缺乏通用性和可解释性。

Method: 将ODMBP建模为半马尔可夫决策过程（SMDP-Option），采用两阶段架构（Option Miner和Option Composer），利用LLM生成策略。

Result: 在涉及10,000多个虚拟机的真实数据集上，MiCo实现了96.9%的竞争比，且在非平稳请求流和多样化配置下表现优异。

Conclusion: MiCo在复杂和大规模云环境中表现出高效性和适应性。

Abstract: In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online
Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by
large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization
methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed
heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based
methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named
MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design
paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov
Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling
through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.
Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware
strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer
employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the
non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on
real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\%
competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual
machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows
and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and
large-scale cloud environments.

TL;DR: ComplexFormer提出了一种新的复杂多头注意力机制（CMHA），通过将语义和位置信息统一在复数平面中建模，显著提升了Transformer模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在整合位置信息和多头注意力灵活性方面存在挑战，限制了其表示能力。

Method: 引入CMHA机制，包括每头的欧拉变换和自适应差分旋转机制，统一建模语义和位置差异。

Result: 在语言建模、文本生成等任务中表现优异，生成困惑度显著降低，长上下文一致性更强。

Conclusion: ComplexFormer提供了一种更灵活、高效的注意力机制，具有更强的参数效率和表达能力。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but
face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while
allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model
semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional
adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This
paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA.
CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional
differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as
rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a
per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections
into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation;
and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism,
exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct
strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative
positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language
modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show
ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation
perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines
like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency,
offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.

Conclusion: 表示叠加是神经缩放定律的关键机制，未来可优化训练策略和架构以提升性能。

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the
observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this
neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model
size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs
represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,
representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur
with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss
scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only
the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of
loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature
frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong
superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,
the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide
range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is
explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower
dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales
inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced
LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match
the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also
agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an
important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate
that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model
architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的并行扩展（ParScale）方法，通过增加模型的并行计算而非参数或输出令牌来提升效率，显著减少了内存和延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩展语言模型的方法（参数扩展或推理时扩展）通常需要较高的空间或时间成本，因此需要一种更高效的扩展方式。

Method: 提出并行扩展（ParScale），通过对输入应用多样且可学习的变换，并行执行模型前向传播，并动态聚合输出。该方法适用于任何模型结构、优化过程或任务。

Result: 实验证明，ParScale在相同性能提升下，内存和延迟开销分别减少22倍和6倍，且可通过少量令牌的后训练将预训练模型转换为并行扩展模型。

Conclusion: ParScale为低资源场景下部署更强大模型提供了新思路，并重新定义了计算在机器学习中的作用。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a
significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter
scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and
more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel
computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and
learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in
parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely
parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing
parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,
data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it
through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel
streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\log P)$ while showing
superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\times$
less memory increase and 6$\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter
scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an
off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training
on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new
scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more
powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative
perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.

Motivation: 解决因缺乏真实用户交互数据和隐私限制导致的合成数据生成不足问题。

Method: 利用领域资源（如内容元数据和知识图谱）及多模态语言模型，通过灵活的路由机制生成合成数据。

Result: 在真实用户查询测试中，函数分类准确率和API参数选择显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于合成数据微调的模型性能优于传统方法，为函数调用任务设定了新基准。

Abstract: This paper addresses fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for function
calling tasks when real user interaction data is unavailable. In digital
content creation tools, where users express their needs through natural
language queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world
task-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate
synthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation
fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data
distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We
present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like
content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and
vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training
data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data
generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a
fundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive
set of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function
classification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our
synthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new
benchmarks for function calling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小型语言模型无法处理视觉输入且预测不匹配视觉上下文，限制了推测解码在视觉语言模型中的应用。

Method: MASSV分两阶段：1）通过轻量级投影器连接目标模型的视觉编码器；2）利用目标模型生成的响应进行自蒸馏视觉指令调优。

Result: 实验显示MASSV在视觉任务中接受长度提升30%，推理速度提升1.46倍。

Conclusion: MASSV为加速当前及未来视觉语言模型提供了一种可扩展且兼容架构的方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by
enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger
target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to
vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small
language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural
components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match
those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce
Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of
Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models
into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first
connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight
trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning
using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.
Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families
demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers
end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV
provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both
current and future VLMs.

Conclusion: SEAL展示了结合NAS和选择性扩展在增量学习中的高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from
a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing
plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge).
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of
the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static
settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often
rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in
resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based
framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint
data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL
adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary,
based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through
cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component
jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy.
Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively
reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size
compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS
and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates training better visual world models for robot
manipulation, i.e., models that can predict future visual observations by
conditioning on past frames and robot actions. Specifically, we consider world
models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to
canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and
reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer,
which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer
first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a
U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the
scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature.
We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video
prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer
achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7%
on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various
robot manipulation domains.

### [118] [ImplicitStainer: Data-Efficient Medical Image Translation for Virtual Antibody-based Tissue Staining Using Local Implicit Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09831)
*Tushar Kataria,Beatrice Knudsen,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ImplicitStainer是一种利用局部隐式函数改进虚拟染色（IHC染色）的新方法，通过像素级预测提升性能，减少数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色无法提供全部诊断信息，而IHC染色耗时且资源密集，虚拟染色成为替代方案。现有方法数据需求高，需改进。

Method: 提出ImplicitStainer，基于局部隐式函数进行图像翻译，专注于像素级预测，减少数据依赖。

Result: 在有限数据下表现优异，优于15种先进GAN和扩散模型。

Conclusion: ImplicitStainer为虚拟染色提供高效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic
diagnosis in pathology. However, H&E staining does not capture all the
diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular
information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark
specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells.
While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are
typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire,
leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep
learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by
computationally generating IHC stains from H&E stained images. Although many
GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used
for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data
points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for
effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that
leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically
virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This
method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering
high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two
datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over
fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models. Full Code and models
trained will be released publicly via Github upon acceptance.

*Pengfei Yu,Bin Huang,Minghui Zhang,Weiwen Wu,Shaoyu Wang,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OSMM的有序子集多扩散模型，用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过分块学习和全局约束提升细节重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分数的扩散模型在处理稀疏视图CT重建时，由于数据量大且冗余，导致学习效果差、细节丢失。

Method: 将CT投影数据分为等量子集，利用多子集扩散模型（MSDM）独立学习每个子集，并结合完整数据的全局扩散模型（OWDM）作为约束。

Result: OSMM在图像质量和噪声鲁棒性上优于传统扩散模型，适应不同稀疏程度的CT数据。

Conclusion: OSMM为稀疏视图CT重建提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of
sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and
riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to
unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning
difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details.
To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model
(OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT
projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model
(MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach
reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details.
Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete
sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the
possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information.
Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness
and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT
sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different
clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms
traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience,
offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in
sparse-view scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合生成语义通信系统（Gen-SemCom），通过嵌入关键信息框架（CIE）解决纯提示驱动生成丢失细节的问题，并设计了GVIF指标评估生成图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯提示驱动的生成语义通信会丢失图像的细粒度细节，且缺乏系统性的评估指标。

Method: 开发了带有CIE框架的混合Gen-SemCom系统，结合文本提示和关键特征传输，提出语义过滤方法选择关键特征，并使用扩散生成模型重建图像。设计了GVIF指标量化图像质量。

Result: GVIF指标对视觉保真度敏感，与PSNR和关键信息量相关。优化系统在PSNR和FID分数上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 混合Gen-SemCom系统和GVIF指标有效提升了生成图像的视觉质量和通信效率。

Abstract: Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial
intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks,
which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts
rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses
fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic
metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these
issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information
embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical
features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic
filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features
of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and
critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a
diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual
information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the
generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,
the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted
features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we
design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume
of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental
results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating
with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized
system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of
higher PSNR and lower FID scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胃癌病灶分析中多模态医学图像分割面临数据稀缺和模态对齐问题，导致算法训练受限和资源浪费。

Method: 提出HWA-UNETR框架，采用可学习的窗口聚合层（HWA块）和三元融合机制，实现多模态动态特征对齐和长程空间依赖建模。

Result: 在GCM 2025和BraTS 2021数据集上验证，Dice分数提升1.68%，且具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HWA-UNETR和GCM 2025数据集为胃癌多模态分割提供了高效解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the
context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by
the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to
amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are
constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration,
leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis
accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions:
First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first
large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans,
featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500
patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework
that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to
establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities'
anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba
mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies.
Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021
dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new
approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\% in the Dice score while
maintaining solid robustness. The dataset and code are public via

TL;DR: 多对比激光内窥镜（MLE）通过可调谐光谱、相干和定向照明，显著提升胃肠道疾病检测的对比度和色彩差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白光内窥镜在检测胃肠道疾病时对比度不足，导致许多临床相关病例被漏诊。

Method: MLE平台结合多光谱漫反射、激光散斑对比成像和光度立体技术，增强组织对比度、量化血流并表征黏膜地形。

Result: MLE在31个息肉样本中显示出对比度提升约3倍，色彩差异提升5倍。

Conclusion: MLE作为一种互补性组织对比工具，有望改善胃肠道成像。

Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in
the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual
abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast
of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go
undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser
Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable
spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three
capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral
diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast
imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We
validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical
colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold
improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference
compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal
multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating
into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to
improve gastrointestinal imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPM在复杂生物系统模拟中计算成本高，需开发替代模型以加速评估。

Method: 使用DDPM训练生成式AI替代模型，结合图像分类器辅助选择和验证。

Result: 替代模型生成比参考配置提前20,000时间步的模型配置，计算时间减少约22倍。

Conclusion: DDPM为开发随机生物系统的数字孪生提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to
investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell
resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework
for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally
expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation
of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated
evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic
nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different
model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work,
we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI
surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We
describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that
define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this
classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model
surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference
configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational
time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards
the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological
systems.

Motivation: 探索利用预训练音频压缩模型实现艺术和计算应用的潜力，避免依赖显式特征映射。

Method: 使用EnCodec嵌入作为潜在表示，通过随机初始化的线性映射直接转换为StyleGAN2的风格潜在空间。

Result: 保留了语义丰富性，实现了细腻且语义一致的音频-视觉转换。

Conclusion: LAV展示了预训练音频压缩模型在艺术和计算应用中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces LAV (Latent Audio-Visual), a system that integrates
EnCodec's neural audio compression with StyleGAN2's generative capabilities to
produce visually dynamic outputs driven by pre-recorded audio. Unlike previous
works that rely on explicit feature mappings, LAV uses EnCodec embeddings as
latent representations, directly transformed into StyleGAN2's style latent
space via randomly initialized linear mapping. This approach preserves semantic
richness in the transformation, enabling nuanced and semantically coherent
audio-visual translations. The framework demonstrates the potential of using
pretrained audio compression models for artistic and computational
applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的隐私风险，提出了一种名为PIG的新框架，通过结合越狱攻击和隐私泄露问题，有效提取敏感信息，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估LLMs隐私泄露时依赖记忆前缀或简单指令，易被对齐模型阻止；同时，越狱攻击在隐私场景中的作用尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出PIG框架，通过识别隐私查询中的PII实体、上下文学习和梯度策略迭代更新，提取目标PII。

Result: 在四种白盒和两种黑盒LLMs上实验，PIG优于基线方法并达到SoTA效果。

Conclusion: 结果凸显LLMs的隐私风险，需更强防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent
privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use
memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which
well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM
safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy
scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of
jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage
and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework
targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the
limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII
entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build
a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based
strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods
using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two
black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy
risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析2025年洛杉矶野火期间的Reddit讨论，利用主题建模和分层框架，揭示了公众对灾害的情境认知和危机叙事，为灾害响应和公共卫生策略提供了数据支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来野火频发且严重，了解公众在灾害中的感知和反应对及时、共情的灾害响应至关重要。社交媒体提供了捕捉公众情绪和信息的渠道。

Method: 收集了385篇帖子和114,879条评论，采用主题建模方法（结合LLMs和HITL），并开发了分层框架（SA和CN）对主题进行分类。

Result: SA类别的讨论量与火灾实际进展一致，公众健康和心理健康是CN类别的主要话题。研究提供了首个标注的社交媒体数据集。

Conclusion: 研究结果为灾害响应、公共卫生沟通和未来类似灾害事件的研究提供了数据支持，并提出了可扩展的分析框架。

Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent
years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during
wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social
media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public
discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment.
This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires,
spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385
posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt
topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large
language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we
develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two
main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The
volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking
within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most
frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and
damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related
latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one
health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60
percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest
total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated
social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable
multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse
analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can
inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public
health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related
disaster events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了地图的艺术性，或难以同时保证地图的准确性和信息丰富性。

Method: CartoAgent利用MLLMs的视觉审美能力和世界知识，将风格与地理数据分离，专注于设计样式表而不修改矢量数据。

Result: 通过地图样式迁移和评估任务验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: CartoAgent可扩展支持多种制图设计决策，并为GenAI在制图中的未来集成提供参考。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents
new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have
either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating
both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a
novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic
practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different
MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize
tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual
aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both
visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data,
it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data,
thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task
centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The
effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and
a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of
cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in
cartography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌电假肢的模式识别控制系统中，用户难以生成足够独特的EMG信号模式以实现可靠分类，且训练过程依赖试错调整。

Method: 通过10次实验，比较了使用Reviewer与传统虚拟手臂可视化训练的12名健康参与者在Fitts定律任务中的表现。

Result: 使用Reviewer的参与者完成率更高，路径效率提升，且减少了过冲现象。

Conclusion: 3D视觉反馈通过结构化训练显著改善了新手操作者的模式识别控制，减少了试错调整的依赖。

Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern
recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals
into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users
often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable
classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error
user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer,
a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's
classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm
behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual,
data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder
boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants
compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the
Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was
assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and
the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer
achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path
efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group.
Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training,
facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control
improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this
approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more
adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual
feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through
structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance
on extensive heuristic adjustments.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩大了有效训练数据集，还为复杂现实场景中的HAR系统提供了改进方向。

Abstract: In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and
variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the
inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a
generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and
conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data
heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the
data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the
random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance,
achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64
$\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence
reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby
improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only
broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for
enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.

agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.
