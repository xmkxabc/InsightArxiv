To the best of our\nknowledge, the proposed work is the first tool that allows users to visualize\nand manipulate 3D objects interactively on a 2D real-world scene, along with a\ncomprehensive user study. This system supports robust 6D camera pose annotation\nby providing both visual cues and spatial relationships to determine object\nposition and orientation in various environments. The annotation feature in\nVision6D is particularly helpful in scenarios where the transformation matrix\nbetween the camera and world objects is unknown, as it enables accurate\nannotation of these objects' poses using only the camera intrinsic matrix. This\ncapability serves as a foundational step in developing and training advanced\npose estimation models across various domains. We evaluate Vision6D's\neffectiveness by utilizing widely-used open-source pose estimation datasets\nLinemod and HANDAL through comparisons between the default ground-truth camera\nposes with manual annotations. A user study was performed to show that Vision6D\ngenerates accurate pose annotations via visual cues in an intuitive 3D user\ninterface. This approach aims to bridge the gap between 2D scene projections\nand 3D scenes, offering an effective way for researchers and developers to\nsolve 6D pose annotation related problems.

In this study, we propose Iterative Cross Graph Matching for Hip\nFracture Risk Assessment (ICGM-FRAX), a novel approach for predicting hip\nfractures using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) images. ICGM-FRAX\ninvolves iteratively comparing a test (subject) graph with multiple template\ngraphs representing the characteristics of hip fracture subjects to assess the\nsimilarity and accurately to predict hip fracture risk. These graphs are\nobtained as follows. The DXA images are separated into multiple regions of\ninterest (RoIs), such as the femoral head, shaft, and lesser trochanter.\nRadiomic features are then calculated for each RoI, with the central\ncoordinates used as nodes in a graph. The connectivity between nodes is\nestablished according to the Euclidean distance between these coordinates. This\nprocess transforms each DXA image into a graph, where each node represents a\nRoI, and edges derived by the centroids of RoIs capture the spatial\nrelationships between them. If the test graph closely matches a set of template\ngraphs representing subjects with incident hip fractures, it is classified as\nindicating high hip fracture risk.

To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes\nSimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy\nto guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between\ntraining and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows\nit to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves\nsimultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete\noutput speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained\nvocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of\nspeech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS\nspeech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency\ntrade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as\nimproving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency."}

Recently, the Mamba architecture based on selective\nstate-space models (S6) has demonstrated great advantages in long sequence\nmodeling. However, the unique properties of hyperspectral data, such as high\ndimensionality and feature inlining, pose challenges to the application of\nMamba to HSI classification. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose\nan full-field interaction multi-groups Mamba framework (HS-Mamba), which adopts\na strategy different from pixel-patch based or whole-image based, but combines\nthe advantages of both. The patches cut from the whole image are sent to\nmulti-groups Mamba, combined with positional information to perceive local\ninline features in the spatial and spectral domains, and the whole image is\nsent to a lightweight attention module to enhance the global feature\nrepresentation ability. Specifically, HS-Mamba consists of a dual-channel\nspatial-spectral encoder (DCSS-encoder) module and a lightweight global inline\nattention (LGI-Att) branch. The DCSS-encoder module uses multiple groups of\nMamba to decouple and model the local features of dual-channel sequences with\nnon-overlapping patches. The LGI-Att branch uses a lightweight compressed and\nextended attention module to perceive the global features of the spatial and\nspectral domains of the unsegmented whole image. By fusing local and global\nfeatures, high-precision classification of hyperspectral images is achieved.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HS-Mamba,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark HSI datasets."}

LongMamba builds on our discovery\nthat the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global\nchannels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily\nresponsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the\nkey bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths\nlargely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit\nlimitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's\npoor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the\nhidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the\naccumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first\nidentifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token\nfiltering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive\nbenchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba\nsets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly\nextending its operational range without requiring additional training.

By\nsynergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet\nmodel, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user.\nSPICE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a challenging realistic\nimage-editing dataset consisting of semantic editing (object addition, removal,\nreplacement, and background change), stylistic editing (texture changes), and\nstructural editing (action change) tasks. Not only does SPICE achieve the\nhighest quantitative performance according to standard evaluation metrics, but\nit is also consistently preferred by users over existing image-editing methods.\nWe release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to\nsupport further research and artistic exploration."}

It does not use production rules, like a conventional\ngraph grammar, but represents the syntactic structure in a more direct and\ndeclarative way. The grammar and the pattern are both represented as networks,\nand parsing is seen as the construction of a homomorphism from the pattern to\nthe grammar. The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested\nrecursive structure in more than one dimension.\n  This supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of\npattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in\nmissing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single\nprocess, to exploit the synergy between them.\n  The emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also\ngive some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex\nrecursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in\ngeometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols,\ncluttered images, and erased patches."}

In this work, we propose\nForesightNav, a novel exploration strategy inspired by human imagination and\nreasoning. Our approach equips robotic agents with the capability to predict\ncontextual information, such as occupancy and semantic details, for unexplored\nregions. These predictions enable the robot to efficiently select meaningful\nlong-term navigation goals, significantly enhancing exploration in unseen\nenvironments. We validate our imagination-based approach using the Structured3D\ndataset, demonstrating accurate occupancy prediction and superior performance\nin anticipating unseen scene geometry. Our experiments show that the\nimagination module improves exploration efficiency in unseen environments,\nachieving a 100% completion rate for PointNav and an SPL of 67% for ObjectNav\non the Structured3D Validation split. These contributions demonstrate the power\nof imagination-driven reasoning for autonomous systems to enhance generalizable\nand efficient exploration."}
