However, some\ntraining samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding\nthem as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the\ncorrelations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address\nthis, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines\npositive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative\nsupervision. Specifically, for a given anchor sample, we partition the\nremaining training set into semantically similar and dissimilar subsets based\non the similarity of their text queries. To effectively leverage these\ncorrelations, we introduce a PSM-guided contrastive loss to ensure that the\nanchor proposal is closer to similar samples and further from dissimilar ones.\nAdditionally, we design a PSM-guided rank loss to ensure that similar samples\nare closer to the anchor proposal than to the negative intra-video proposal,\naiming to distinguish the anchor proposal and the negative intra-video\nproposal.

Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural\nrepresentations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli\nin the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In\nrecent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual\ncortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized\nefficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we\ninvestigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep\nlearning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a\ngeneralized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking\nresemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and\nhigh-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and\nbottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity\nacross the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response\nNormalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory\nand inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of\nNeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and\nobserve significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in\ndomain generalization tasks.

Using skew-normal curves fitted\nalong semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced\npatterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets:\nBenchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages).\nAnnotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines\npredict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling\ninterpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based\napproaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning,\nsupporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents.

However, existing\nmethods rely on computationally intensive procedures and struggle to\nefficiently capture complex, semantic concepts. Recently, the Concept Discovery\nthrough Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT) framework,\nintroduced by Varshney et al. (2025), attempts to identify concepts via\ndimension-wise traversal of the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder\ntrained on counterfactual trajectories. Extending the CDCT framework, this work\nintroduces Concept Directions via Latent Clustering (CDLC), which extracts\nglobal, class-specific concept directions by clustering latent difference\nvectors derived from factual and diffusion-generated counterfactual image\npairs. CDLC substantially reduces computational complexity by eliminating the\nexhaustive latent dimension traversal required in CDCT and enables the\nextraction of multidimensional semantic concepts encoded across the latent\ndimensions. This approach is validated on a real-world skin lesion dataset,\ndemonstrating that the extracted concept directions align with clinically\nrecognized dermoscopic features and, in some cases, reveal dataset-specific\nbiases or unknown biomarkers. These results highlight that CDLC is\ninterpretable, scalable, and applicable across high-stakes domains and diverse\ndata modalities."}

Existing semantic decoding\nmethods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene,\nwhich is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding\nand decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was\nextracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed\nto reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation\nnetwork was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a\nreference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to\nreconstruct video from sketch. Experimental results showed that the proposed\nmethod achieved significantly better video reconstruction performance than\nbaseline methods. The sketch compression method could effectively reduce the\nstorage and transmission consumption of semantic information with little\ncompromise on video quality. The proposed method provides a novel semantic\nencoding and decoding method that only needs a few training samples for each\nsurveillance scene, thus improving the practicality of the semantic\ncommunication system."}

At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --\nmirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the\nreverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok\nfundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key\nways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion\nand AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok\ntokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture\n-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training\nobjectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman\nequation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports\nreinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable\nto that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA\ntokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality\nreconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for\nboth visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any\ntext-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual\ntokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all\nthe existing models by a large margin.

Based on this, we propose an efficient method to\nquantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a\ndistinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions\nduring training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes\nnoisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable\nones.

Mapping mesoscale neural circuitry is done using injections\nof tracers that label groups of neurons whose axons project to different brain\nregions. Since many neurons are labeled, it is difficult to follow individual\naxons. Previous approaches have instead quantified the regional projections\nusing the total label intensity within a region. However, such a quantification\nis not biologically meaningful. We propose a new approach better connected to\nthe underlying neurons by skeletonizing labeled axon fragments and then\nestimating a volumetric length density. Our approach uses a combination of deep\nnets and the Discrete Morse (DM) technique from computational topology. This\ntechnique takes into account nonlocal connectivity information and therefore\nprovides noise-robustness. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of the\napproach on whole-brain tracer injected data. We also define and illustrate an\ninformation theoretic measure that quantifies the additional information\nobtained, compared to the skeletonized tracer injection fragments, when\nindividual axon morphologies are available. Our approach is the first\napplication of the DM technique to computational neuroanatomy. It can help\nbridge between single-axon skeletons and tracer injections, two important data\ntypes in mapping neural networks in vertebrates."}

The\nresults show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a\nsimilarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic\nsegmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32\nresolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most\nbelieve that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection."}

While teleoperation\nprovides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead,\nwhat if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to\ncollect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to\ncollect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects.\nTo record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and\neasy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and\nrobot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on\neach dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies\ncapable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with\nminimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that\nDexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in\nunseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot\ndata only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic\nreasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a\ncompelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However,\ntheir outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether\nimagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap\nbetween imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),\nan agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration\nis often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to\ndeepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to\nabstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,\npredict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences\nthrough action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop\nenvironments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful\nexploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the\nentropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports\ndownstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the\nperformance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations."}
