These specialized workflows introduce unique\nchallenges for GUI perception models, including high-resolution displays,\nsmaller target sizes, and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce\nScreenSpot-Pro, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding\ncapabilities of MLLMs in high-resolution professional settings. The benchmark\ncomprises authentic high-resolution images from a variety of professional\ndomains with expert annotations. It spans 23 applications across five\nindustries and three operating systems. Existing GUI grounding models perform\npoorly on this dataset, with the best model achieving only 18.9%. Our\nexperiments reveal that strategically reducing the search area enhances\naccuracy. Based on this insight, we propose ScreenSeekeR, a visual search\nmethod that utilizes the GUI knowledge of a strong planner to guide a cascaded\nsearch, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% without any\nadditional training.

However, recent studies reveal\nsubstantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases\ninference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting\nattention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate\nthe internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three\nprimary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts.\nMoreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition\nthoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought\ncategories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we\nintroduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that\nseamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating\nsignificant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting\nthe reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly\ncalibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using\nthe steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong\ntransferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple\nmodels (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500,\nGSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11%\nimprovement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%.

Most of models use either independent modules to separately\nextract temporal and spatial correlations or joint modules to synchronously\nextract them, without considering the spatial-temporal correlations. Moreover,\nmodels that consider joint spatial-temporal correlations (temporal, spatial,\nand spatial-temporal correlations) often encounter significant challenges in\naccuracy and computational efficiency which prevent such models from\ndemonstrating the expected advantages of a joint spatial-temporal correlations\narchitecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient pure\nconvolutional network for traffic prediction via spatial-temporal encoding and\ninferring (STEI-PCN). The model introduces and designs a dynamic adjacency\nmatrix inferring module based on absolute spatial and temporal coordinates, as\nwell as relative spatial and temporal distance encoding, using a graph\nconvolutional network combined with gating mechanism to capture local\nsynchronous joint spatial-temporal correlations. Additionally, three layers of\ntemporal dilated causal convolutional network are used to capture long-range\ntemporal correlations.

Experiments validate TrinEval's\neffectiveness in reformulation, and its evaluation reveals that common LLMs may\nmemorize by rote 20.5% of knowledge points (in MMLU on average).", "AI": {"task": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7TrinEval\u6846\u67b6\u533a\u5206\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff08MCQ\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MCQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56e0\u57fa\u51c6\u6c61\u67d3\u800c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd8\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTrinEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06MCQ\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1TrinEval\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u89c1LLMs\u5728MMLU\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e8620.5%\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "TrinEval\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question\nAnswering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on\nmodality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nrepresentations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces\nVision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that\nintegrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse\nvisual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need\nfor intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and\nreasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively\nalign vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for\nmultimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific\nmodules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal\nreranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative\nthreshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question\nanswering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the\nretrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, current\npost-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome\nsupervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability\nand high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without\nthe need for external supervision. We introduce a generalizable and purely\nunsupervised self-training framework, named Genius. Without external auxiliary,\nGenius requires to seek the optimal response sequence in a stepwise manner and\noptimize the LLM. To explore the potential steps and exploit the optimal ones,\nGenius introduces a stepwise foresight re-sampling strategy to sample and\nestimate the step value by simulating future outcomes. Further, we recognize\nthat the unsupervised setting inevitably induces the intrinsic noise and\nuncertainty. To provide a robust optimization, we propose an\nadvantage-calibrated optimization (ACO) loss function to mitigate estimation\ninconsistencies.

To face the challenge, task decomposition has become an\neffective way, which proposes to divide a complex task into multiple simpler\nsubtasks and then solve them separately so that the difficulty of the original\ntask can be reduced. However, the performance of existing task decomposition\nmethods can be suboptimal when the task contains overly complex logic and\nconstraints. In this situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from\nthe original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or even erroneous\ncontent. Therefore, inspired by the fact that humans possess two thinking\nsystems including fast thinking and slow thinking, this paper introduces a new\ntask decomposition method termed ``Fast-Slow-Thinking'' (FST), which stimulates\nLLMs to solve tasks through the cooperation of Fast Thinking (FT) and Slow\nThinking (ST) steps. Here FT focuses more on the general and concise aspect of\nthe task, and ST focuses more on the details of the task. In FT, LLMs are\nprompted to remove the constraints of the original task, therefore simplifying\nit to a general and concise one. In ST, we recall the constraints removed in\nFT, so that LLMs can improve the answer generated in FT to meet the\nrequirements of the original task.

Specifically, we employ a coarse-to-fine planar-grid feature\nrepresentation to extract global features from multi-frame point clouds and\nleverage a CNN-based encoder to extract local semantic features from the\ncurrent frame point cloud. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and KITTI-360\ndemonstrate the superiority of SN-LiDAR in both semantic and geometric\nreconstruction, effectively handling dynamic objects and large-scale scenes.\nCodes will be available on https://github.com/dtc111111/SN-Lidar.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51faSN-LiDAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u548cLiDAR\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u91cd\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u7f51\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548cCNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cKITTI-360\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "SN-LiDAR\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question\nAnswering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on\nmodality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nrepresentations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces\nVision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that\nintegrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse\nvisual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need\nfor intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and\nreasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively\nalign vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for\nmultimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific\nmodules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal\nreranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative\nthreshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question\nanswering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the\nretrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On MultimodalQA\nvalidation set, VLMT-Large achieves 76.5% Exact Match and 80.1% F1,\noutperforming the previous state-of-the-art by +9.1% in Exact Match and +8.8%\nin F1. On WebQA, it attains a QA score of 47.6, surpassing prior models such as\nPERQA by +3.2.

These devices provide diverse, multi-modal sensor inputs,\nincluding egocentric images, and 1-3 sparse IMU sensors in varied combinations.\nMotion descriptions can also accompany these signals. The diverse input\nmodalities and their intermittent availability pose challenges for consistent\nmotion capture and understanding. In this work, we present Ego4o (o for omni),\na new framework for simultaneous human motion capture and understanding from\nmulti-modal egocentric inputs. This method maintains performance with partial\ninputs while achieving better results when multiple modalities are combined.\nFirst, the IMU sensor inputs, the optional egocentric image, and text\ndescription of human motion are encoded into the latent space of a motion\nVQ-VAE.

However, the process of assessing the maturity\nof bananas at an industrial level is still carried out using manual methods.\nThe use of CNN models is an attractive tool to solve the problem, but there is\na limitation regarding the availability of sufficient data to train these\nmodels reliably. On the other hand, in the state-of-the-art, existing CNN\nmodels and the available data have reported that the accuracy results are\nacceptable in identifying banana maturity. For this reason, this work presents\nthe generation of a robust dataset that combines real and synthetic data for\ndifferent levels of banana ripeness. In addition, it proposes a simple CNN\narchitecture, which is trained with synthetic data and using the transfer\nlearning technique, the model is improved to classify real data, managing to\ndetermine the level of maturity of the banana. The proposed CNN model is\nevaluated with several architectures, then hyper-parameter configurations are\nvaried, and optimizers are used.

Unlike conventional\ndiffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion\nprocess in a compressed latent representation, improving computational\nefficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To\nvalidate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE\neffectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR\nassociated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image\ngeneration and reconstruction while being computationally efficient.\nExperimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations\ndemonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%)\nand age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic\nrepresentations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible\nmodifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong\nreconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month\ngap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance\n(SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal\nprogression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE\nsignificantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing\nreconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework\nfor scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a\nfoundation model for medical image analysis.

However, information extraction (IE)\nfrom building drawings is often time-consuming and costly, especially when\ndealing with historical buildings. Drawing search can be simplified by\nleveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing,\nwhich can be seen as drawing metadata. However, title block IE can be complex\nespecially when dealing with historical drawings which do not follow existing\nstandards for uniformity. This work performs a comparison of existing methods\nfor this kind of IE task, and then proposes a novel title block detection and\nIE pipeline which outperforms existing methods, in particular when dealing with\ncomplex, noisy historical drawings. The pipeline is obtained by combining a\nlightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference\npipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then\nextract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used\nfor drawing search, filtering and grouping.

However, existing methods focus solely on\npredicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands\nare visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that\napproximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the\ncamera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D\ntrajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out\nof the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for\nEgocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation\nsequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both\nhands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing\nother joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and\nbody joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D\nreprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate\nEgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand\nannotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences,\nrespectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the\nbaseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand\npose forecasting.

The coarse reconstruction\nis aligned to the template using geodesic-based coherent point drift, enabling\nanatomically consistent 3D bone volumes. Experimental results on a clinical\ndataset show that X2B achieves the highest numerical accuracy, with an IoU of\n0.952 and Chamfer-L1 distance of 0.005, outperforming recent baselines\nincluding X2V and D2IM-Net. Building on this, X2BR incorporates anatomical\npriors via YOLOv9-based bone detection and biomechanical template alignment,\nleading to reconstructions that, while slightly lower in IoU (0.875), offer\nsuperior anatomical realism, especially in rib curvature and vertebral\nalignment.

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding\nof large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we\npresent FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that\nincorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks\nto the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between\npure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of\nunderstanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any\nexternal source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment\nas a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate\nmap representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM\nsystem corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation\nbetween submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from\nefficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into\nobject-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary\nqueries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The\nopen-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art\nsemantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level\nof scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects\nor areas of interest selected via natural language queries.

The\nnon-stationary environment results in distribution shifts and, consequently, a\ndegradation in accuracy. Continuous learning of the deployed model with new\ndata could be one remedy. However, the question arises as to how we should\nupdate the model with new training data so that it retains its accuracy on the\nold data while adapting to the new data. In this work, we propose a\ntask-conditioned ensemble of models to maintain the performance of the existing\nmodel. The method involves an ensemble of expert models based on task\nmembership information. The in-domain models-based on the local outlier concept\n(different from the expert models) provide task membership information\ndynamically at run-time to each probe sample. To evaluate the proposed method,\nwe experiment with three setups: the first represents distribution shift\nbetween tasks (LivDet-Iris-2017), the second represents distribution shift both\nbetween and within tasks (LivDet-Iris-2020), and the third represents disjoint\ndistribution between tasks (Split MNIST).
