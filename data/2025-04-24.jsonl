In computer vision, IVD has become an emerging task that leverages\nvideo from surveillance cameras and audio from remote microphones to localize\nand classify vehicles in each frame as moving, idling, or engine-off. As with\nother cross-modal tasks, the key challenge lies in modeling the correspondence\nbetween audio and visual modalities, which differ in representation but provide\ncomplementary cues -- video offers spatial and motion context, while audio\nconveys engine activity beyond the visual field. The previous end-to-end model,\nwhich uses a basic attention mechanism, struggles to align these modalities\neffectively, often missing vehicle detections. To address this issue, we\npropose AVIVDNetv2, a transformer-based end-to-end detection network. It\nincorporates a cross-modal transformer with global patch-level learning, a\nmultiscale visual feature fusion module, and decoupled detection heads.\nExtensive experiments show that AVIVDNetv2 improves mAP by 7.66 over the\ndisjoint baseline and 9.42 over the E2E baseline, with consistent AP gains\nacross all vehicle categories.

This\nextended generation length reflects the multi-step, compositional nature of\nreasoning and is often correlated with higher solution accuracy. From an\nefficiency perspective, longer token generation exacerbates the inherently\nsequential and memory-bound decoding phase of LLMs. However, not all parts of\nthis expensive reasoning process are equally difficult to generate. We leverage\nthis observation by offloading only the most challenging parts of the reasoning\nprocess to a larger, more capable model, while performing most of the\ngeneration with a smaller, more efficient model; furthermore, we teach the\nsmaller model to identify these difficult segments and independently trigger\noffloading when needed. To enable this behavior, we annotate difficult segments\nacross 18k reasoning traces from the OpenR1-Math-220k chain-of-thought (CoT)\ndataset. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning (RLFT) to a 1.5B-parameter reasoning model, training it to learn to\noffload the most challenging parts of its own reasoning process to a larger\nmodel. This approach improves AIME24 reasoning accuracy by 24% and 28.3% while\noffloading 1.35% and 5% of the generated tokens respectively. We open-source\nour SplitReason model, data, code and logs."}

To address this challenge, we propose the\nPlan-then-Act-and-Review (PAR RAG) framework, which is organized into three key\nstages: planning, act, and review, and aims to offer an interpretable and\nincremental reasoning paradigm for accurate and reliable multi-hop question\nanswering by mitigating error propagation.PAR RAG initially applies a top-down\nproblem decomposition strategy, formulating a comprehensive plan that\nintegrates multiple executable steps from a holistic viewpoint.

Conclusion: These findings\nhighlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training\nof surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for\nsurgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated\nlearning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the\ninherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in\nvideo-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating\nspatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments."}

In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse\nattention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better\nanalytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce\nGeneralized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window,\nstrided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design\nchoices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can\nprovide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting.\nFinally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed\nattention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in\nCUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically\npossible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective\nutilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16.

However, Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible\nw.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been\nproven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a\nnovel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue.\nMotivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum\ndoubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the\nself-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the\nexpressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that\nbetter preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple\nsmall-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently\nsurpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic\nTransformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a\nnovel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR\ndecomposition) that can be of independent interest.

Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL.
