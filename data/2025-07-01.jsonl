Here, we present a quantum\ncomputing framework specifically developed for utility-level quantum processors\nto address this problem. Starting from an amino acid sequence, we formulate the\nstructure prediction task as a ground-state energy minimization problem using\nthe Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Amino acid connectivity is encoded\non a tetrahedral lattice model, and structural constraints-including steric,\ngeometric, and chirality terms-are mapped into a problem-specific Hamiltonian\nexpressed as sparse Pauli operators. The optimization is executed via a\ntwo-stage architecture separating energy estimation and measurement decoding,\nallowing noise mitigation under realistic quantum device conditions. We\nevaluate the framework on 23 randomly selected real protein fragments from the\nPDBbind dataset, as well as 7 real fragments from proteins with therapeutic\npotential, and run the experiments on the IBM-Cleveland Clinic quantum\nprocessor.

In this\npaper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, not only as a\nnatural phenomenon but as a programmable mechanism for generating specific RNA\ntarget sequences from DNA templates. The problem we address is whether we can\nencode a set of RNA sequences for a given system onto a DNA template word,\nensuring that all the sequences are generated through co-transcriptional\nsplicing. Given that finding the optimal encoding has been shown to be\nNP-complete under the various energy models considered, we propose a practical\nalternative approach under the logarithmic energy model. More specifically, we\nprovide a construction that encodes an arbitrary nondeterministic finite\nautomaton (NFA) into a circular DNA template from which co-transcriptional\nsplicing produces all sequences accepted by the NFA. As all finite languages\ncan be efficiently encoded as NFA, this framework solves the problem of finding\nsmall DNA templates for arbitrary target sets of RNA sequences.

However, up to this date no\nderandomization is known.\n  Our first result is a simple deterministic algorithm for EWPM that runs in\ntime $n^{O(\\ell)}$, where $\\ell$ is the number of distinct weights that perfect\nmatchings in $G$ can take.

Most existing methods of\nefficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of\nflattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like\nfolding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to\ngarment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified\nframework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic\nfling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for\nprecise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding\ninvolves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's\nshape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot\nlearning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,\nwhich incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and\nintersection-over-union (IoU) metrics.

In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation\nmodule to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing\nissue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced\nstructure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information\nflow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an\nattribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and\nstructural information for discriminating mixed anomalies.

During inference, abnormal\npatches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the\nlocation prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into\npixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation.

Multi-Cyclic Queuing and\nForwarding (Multi-CQF) is a new and emerging TSN shaping mechanism that uses\nmultiple cycles on the same egress port, allowing it to accommodate TSN flows\nwith varied timing requirements more effectively than CQF. Despite its\npotential, current Multi-CQF configuration studies are limited, leading to a\nlack of comprehensive research, poor understanding of the mechanism, and\nlimited adoption of Multi-CQF in practical applications.

First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the\ncore storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS. To this\nend, NaviX is built on the Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) graph,\nwhich itself is a graph-based structure. Second, we aim to support\npredicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest\nneighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary\nsubset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS. We adopt a\nprefiltering approach that evaluates QS first and passes the full description\nof subset S to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering\nsearch algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under\ndifferent correlations between subset S and query vector vQ. We propose an\nadaptive algorithm that uses the local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW\ngraph to choose an appropriate heuristic at every iteration of the kNN search.\nFinally, We demonstrate NaviX's robustness and efficiency through extensive\nexperiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based\nbaselines.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23397v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.DB"], "cate": "cs.IR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23397v1", "date": "2025-06-29", "updated": "2025-06-29"}

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining\nprovides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and\nantibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the\nH&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is\npromising for efficient IHC generation.

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

Objective: However, the scarcity of labeled samples\nand the class imbalance issue in vulnerability datasets present significant\nchallenges for both Vulnerability Type Prediction (VTP) and Line-level\nVulnerability Detection (LVD), especially for rare yet critical vulnerability\ntypes. Moreover, most existing studies treat VTP and LVD as independent tasks,\noverlooking their inherent correlation, which limits the potential to leverage\nshared semantic patterns across tasks. Methods: To address these limitations,\nwe propose a unified approach that integrates Embedding-Layer Driven\nAdversarial Training (EDAT) with Multi-task Learning (MTL).

Meanwhile, MTL improves\noverall performance by leveraging shared representations and inter-task\ncorrelations between VTP and LVD.

However, existing ISAC paradigms rely solely on radio frequency (RF)\nsignal, limiting sensing resolution and robustness in V2X environments with\nhigh mobility and multipath interference. Fortunately, the widespread\ndeployment of diverse non-RF sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, along with the\nintegration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication systems, offers\nnew opportunities to improve the synergy between sensing and communication.\nMotivated by this, this work develops a novel and robust communication\nframework that leverages multi-modal sensing data and advanced AI technologies\nto assist beamforming in dynamic and realistic vehicular scenarios.\nSpecifically, we propose a multi-modal learning framework for predictive\nbeamforming that integrates modality-specific branches and employs hierarchical\nTransformer to capture cross-modal features.

These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,\nencompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.\nThe evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear\nprobing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,\nand cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models\nwhile demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image\ndomains and task settings.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation.

We\nuse trunk spaces that exclude high-degree monomials that do not improve the\napproximation quality of the discrete space.

Unlike structured or\nsemi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,\nreading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and\ntranscribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the\nrecognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing\nlayout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding\nin structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and\nneglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To\naddress these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that\nintegrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on\nhistorical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding\nmodule that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture\npolygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies\nthis geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from\nLayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal\ninformation to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance\ndirectly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence\nrobustness.

To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce\nBrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate\nlong-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in\ntwo stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning\nmechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally\nefficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to\nmodel global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the\nMamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,\nUKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and\nregression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing\nmethods by a significant margin.

In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem\ninvolves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters\nand terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex\noptimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By\nexploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT\nconditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual\nsolution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case.\nThis theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient,\nnon-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes\nthe optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data\nsequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent\nframework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV\nsystems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ\ncontrol of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single\ninput-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy,\nimproving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon\nLTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes.

A\ncommon finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,\ngenerate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or\nat worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an\nover-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model\nsuffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual\ninput. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.\nSpecifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,\nwe propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any\nVLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module\nis able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used\nVLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on\nmultiple benchmarks.

Therefore, effective data recovery methods are\nessential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.\nwhile classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are\nincapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios\ninvolving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust\nTensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately\nmodeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is\noften constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the\nsuboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model\naccuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2\nnorm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective\nlow-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,\nwe further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor\nL1-L2 norm in the gradient domain.

We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens.

This paper presents a generalized analytical\nframework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the\ndifferential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth\nassumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's\ncurvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we\nderive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle\nbetween the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical\ncharacterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential\nDoppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and\nprobability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a\nspherical cap cell.

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient\nshort-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their\ndata. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous\nmaintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time,\nenergy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based\nsystems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs,\nand environmental impact.

However,\nmost current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,\nassuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions.

To address this challenge, we introduce\nAutoCalib, the first framework designed to automatically and accurately\ncalibrate high-resolution mmWave radars by identifying Ambient Radio Anchors\n(ARAs)-naturally existing objects in ambient environments that offer stable\nphase references. AutoCalib achieves calibration by first generating spatial\nspectrum templates based on theoretical electromagnetic characteristics.

Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures, first draft", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22899v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.GR", "cs.LG", "cs.MA", "eess.IV"], "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22899v1", "date": "2025-06-28", "updated": "2025-06-28"}

Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting\ntarget concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with\nminimal distortion.

In this work,\nwe first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion\nmodels, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \\emph{linear} modules to\nweights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we\npropose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding\n\\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or\ncut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad\ndistributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the\nforgetting.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss.

In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is\noften the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow\nobservational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of\nmultiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent\nstate space. Building on this representation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta\nstates that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal\nrelationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)\niteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven\nexploration and agent experiences.

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation.

To\ntackle this problem, we model service demand as a linear function of service\nattributes and formulate the service placement task as a linear bandit problem,\nwhere SBSs act as agents and services as arms.

A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom.

On\nthe other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak\nsupervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A\nSemantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality\nconstraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate\nobject query for spatiotemporal modeling.

In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,\ninference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the\napplicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,\nand 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and\nmorphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed\nframework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures, first draft", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22899v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.GR", "cs.LG", "cs.MA", "eess.IV"], "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22899v1", "date": "2025-06-28", "updated": "2025-06-28"}

To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a\nmethod for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.\nSATs take image segments (such as \"eyes\" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency\nmaps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model\nrelies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance\non backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance\nsees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of\nsaliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named\nsegments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and\noverly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and\ndebugging image classifiers.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23247v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23247v1", "date": "2025-06-29", "updated": "2025-06-29"}

Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data.

To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V\nsettings demonstrate that \\method outperforms existing baselines.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots.

To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can\nhandle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a\nmethodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an\niterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of\ngradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related\nquantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to\nedge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact\nthat edges are far fewer than paths.

In this paper, we propose\nan efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity\nVision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a\nlightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each\nmodality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate\nmodality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the\nmodality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based\nFEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,\ncross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused\nrepresentations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target\nlocalization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking\nbenchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,\nFE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the\nproposed tracking framework.

Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion.

We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens.

Therefore,\nwe propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach.

Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing\nreal-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully\nsegmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant\nbiases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and\ncorrelation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models.

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,\ndespite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and\nefficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for\nIARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in\npreserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and\npreventing unauthorized use of their generated images.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23731v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV"], "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23731v1", "date": "2025-06-30", "updated": "2025-06-30"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized\nFL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),\nwhich wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and\nglobal-server training to boost segmentation.
