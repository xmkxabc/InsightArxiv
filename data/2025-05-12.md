Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文描述了从自然驾驶研究中提取和表征驾驶员在路口头部扫描的自动化方法，结合了视频、GPS和车辆数据，开发了定制工具和AI模型，验证了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然驾驶研究产生大量多样化数据，需自动化处理以高效分析驾驶员行为，特别是在路口的关键操作。

Method: 开发工具标记路口，同步视频与位置数据，使用AI模型检测头部姿态和场景对象，结合规则算法推断路口类型和操作。

Result: 自动化算法在路口标志和操作检测上准确率分别为100%和94%，车辆进入路口的误差较小，路口边界估计与真实值高度重叠。

Conclusion: 自动化方法能高效处理自然驾驶数据，为驾驶员行为研究提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies use devices in participants' own vehicles to
record daily driving over many months. Due to diverse and extensive amounts of
data recorded, automated processing is necessary. This report describes methods
to extract and characterize driver head scans at intersections from data
collected from an in-car recording system that logged vehicle speed, GPS
location, scene videos, and cabin videos. Custom tools were developed to mark
the intersections, synchronize location and video data, and clip the cabin and
scene videos for +/-100 meters from the intersection location. A
custom-developed head pose detection AI model for wide angle head turns was run
on the cabin videos to estimate the driver head pose, from which head scans >20
deg were computed in the horizontal direction. The scene videos were processed
using a YOLO object detection model to detect traffic lights, stop signs,
pedestrians, and other vehicles on the road. Turning maneuvers were
independently detected using vehicle self-motion patterns. Stop lines on the
road surface were detected using changing intensity patterns over time as the
vehicle moved. The information obtained from processing the scene videos, along
with the speed data was used in a rule-based algorithm to infer the
intersection type, maneuver, and bounds. We processed 190 intersections from 3
vehicles driven in cities and suburban areas from Massachusetts and California.
The automated video processing algorithm correctly detected intersection
signage and maneuvers in 100% and 94% of instances, respectively. The median
[IQR] error in detecting vehicle entry into the intersection was 1.1[0.4-4.9]
meters and 0.2[0.1-0.54] seconds. The median overlap between ground truth and
estimated intersection bounds was 0.88[0.82-0.93].

### [3] [MDDFNet: Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion Network for Traffic Sign Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05491)
*TianYi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MDDFNet的新型目标检测网络，用于解决交通标志检测中特征提取单一和多尺度目标检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通标志检测是自动驾驶中的关键任务，但现有方法在特征多样性和多尺度处理上存在不足。

Method: MDDFNet结合了动态双融合模块和Mamba-based主干网络，前者通过多分支整合空间和语义信息，后者自适应融合全局和局部特征。

Result: 在TT100K数据集上的实验表明，MDDFNet优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: MDDFNet在小型交通标志检测中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The Detection of small objects, especially traffic signs, is a critical
sub-task in object detection and autonomous driving. Despite signficant
progress in previous research, two main challenges remain. First, the issue of
feature extraction being too singular. Second, the detection process struggles
to efectively handle objects of varying sizes or scales. These problems are
also prevalent in general object detection tasks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion
Network (MDDFNet), for traffic sign detection. The network integrates a dynamic
dual fusion module and a Mamba-based backbone to simultaneously tackle the
aforementioned issues. Specifically, the dynamic dual fusion module utilizes
multiple branches to consolidate various spatial and semantic information, thus
enhancing feature diversity. The Mamba-based backbone leverages global feature
fusion and local feature interaction, combining features in an adaptive manner
to generate unique classification characteristics. Extensive experiments
conducted on the TT100K (Tsinghua-Tencent 100K) datasets demonstrate that
MDDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors, maintaining real-time
processing capabilities of single-stage models while achieving superior
performance. This confirms the efectiveness of MDDFNet in detecting small
traffic signs.

### [5] [Learning 3D Persistent Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05495)
*Siyuan Zhou,Yilun Du,Yuncong Yang,Lei Han,Peihao Chen,Dit-Yan Yeung,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种具有显式记忆的持久性世界模型，用于解决现有视频模型在长时程规划中的局限性，通过3D空间地图实现更一致的未来模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频模型缺乏对未观测场景的记忆，导致长时程规划不一致，特别是在复杂环境中部分观测的情况下。

Method: 采用视频扩散模型预测未来RGB-D视频，并将其聚合为持久性3D环境地图，通过地图条件化实现更一致的模拟。

Result: 模型能够忠实模拟观测和未观测部分的世界，提升了长时程规划的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的持久性世界模型在具体应用中有效支持规划和策略学习，展现了其在智能体任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the effects of future actions on the world is a
crucial ability of intelligent embodied agents, enabling agents to anticipate
the effects of their actions and make plans accordingly. While a large body of
existing work has explored how to construct such world models using video
models, they are often myopic in nature, without any memory of a scene not
captured by currently observed images, preventing agents from making consistent
long-horizon plans in complex environments where many parts of the scene are
partially observed. We introduce a new persistent embodied world model with an
explicit memory of previously generated content, enabling much more consistent
long-horizon simulation. During generation time, our video diffusion model
predicts RGB-D video of the future observations of the agent. This generation
is then aggregated into a persistent 3D map of the environment. By conditioning
the video model on this 3D spatial map, we illustrate how this enables video
world models to faithfully simulate both seen and unseen parts of the world.
Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of such a world model in downstream
embodied applications, enabling effective planning and policy learning.

### [6] [Preliminary Explorations with GPT-4o(mni) Native Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05501)
*Pu Cao,Feng Zhou,Junyi Ji,Qingye Kong,Zhixiang Lv,Mingjian Zhang,Xuekun Zhao,Siqi Wu,Yinghui Lin,Qing Song,Lu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o展示了强大的多模态生成能力，但在空间推理、知识密集型任务和一致性预测方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o在多任务中的能力，评估其在图像生成和相关任务中的表现。

Method: 构建任务分类和测试样本，对GPT-4o在六类任务中进行定性评估。

Result: GPT-4o在通用合成任务中表现优异，但在空间推理、知识密集型任务和一致性预测中存在不足。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在多模态生成方面取得显著进展，但尚未达到专业或安全关键领域的可靠应用标准。

Abstract: Recently, the visual generation ability by GPT-4o(mni) has been unlocked by
OpenAI. It demonstrates a very remarkable generation capability with excellent
multimodal condition understanding and varied task instructions. In this paper,
we aim to explore the capabilities of GPT-4o across various tasks. Inspired by
previous study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated
set of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting
from GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process
demonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks.
Thus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its
performance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks,
discriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation,
spatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These
tasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's
outputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world
concepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in
general-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image
generation, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However,
significant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial
reasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction.
Furthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios,
such as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often
exhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies. These
findings suggest that while GPT-4o marks a substantial advancement in unified
multimodal generation, there is still a long way to go before it can be
reliably applied to professional or safety-critical domains.

### [7] [Apply Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation to Complex Attributes Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05505)
*Yiming Qin,Zhu Xu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCoG提出了一种自动化方法，通过分解长描述并按遮挡顺序生成3D对象，解决了现有文本到3D模型在复杂属性对象上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D模型在长描述理解和遮挡部分生成上存在问题，导致属性绑定错误和生成质量不稳定。

Method: 利用大语言模型分解长描述为部分块，按遮挡顺序生成，并通过高斯核优化和标签消除实现精确属性绑定。

Result: HCoG生成了结构连贯且属性准确的复杂3D对象。

Conclusion: HCoG通过自动化方法显著提升了文本到3D模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Recent text-to-3D models can render high-quality assets, yet they still
stumble on objects with complex attributes. The key obstacles are: (1) existing
text-to-3D approaches typically lift text-to-image models to extract semantics
via text encoders, while the text encoder exhibits limited comprehension
ability for long descriptions, leading to deviated cross-attention focus,
subsequently wrong attribute binding in generated results. (2) Occluded object
parts demand a disciplined generation order and explicit part disentanglement.
Though some works introduce manual efforts to alleviate the above issues, their
quality is unstable and highly reliant on manual information. To tackle above
problems, we propose a automated method Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation
(HCoG). It leverages a large language model to decompose the long description
into blocks representing different object parts, and orders them from inside
out according to occlusions, forming a hierarchical chain. Within each block we
first coarsely create components, then precisely bind attributes via
target-region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization.
Between blocks, we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to
seamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels, re-assigning
semantic labels, and eliminating unnecessary kernels, ensuring that only
relevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts.
Experiments confirm that HCoG yields structurally coherent, attribute-faithful
3D objects with complex attributes. The code is available at

Result: 实验结果表明，RoboOccWorld在室内3D占用场景演化预测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文成功填补了室内3D占用场景预测的空白，并展示了新框架的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding and forecasting the scene evolutions deeply affect the
exploration and decision of embodied agents. While traditional methods simulate
scene evolutions through trajectory prediction of potential instances, current
works use the occupancy world model as a generative framework for describing
fine-grained overall scene dynamics. However, existing methods cluster on the
outdoor structured road scenes, while ignoring the exploration of forecasting
3D occupancy scene evolutions for robots in indoor scenes. In this work, we
explore a new framework for learning the scene evolutions of observed
fine-grained occupancy and propose an occupancy world model based on the
combined spatio-temporal receptive field and guided autoregressive transformer
to forecast the scene evolutions, called RoboOccWorld. We propose the
Conditional Causal State Attention (CCSA), which utilizes camera poses of next
state as conditions to guide the autoregressive transformer to adapt and
understand the indoor robotics scenarios. In order to effectively exploit the
spatio-temporal cues from historical observations, Hybrid Spatio-Temporal
Aggregation (HSTA) is proposed to obtain the combined spatio-temporal receptive
field based on multi-scale spatio-temporal windows. In addition, we restructure
the OccWorld-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the
evaluation of the indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction task.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoboOccWorld outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction
task. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Rice is an essential staple food worldwide that is important in promoting
international trade, economic growth, and nutrition. Asian countries such as
China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia are notable for their
significant contribution to the cultivation and utilization of rice. These
nations are also known for cultivating different rice grains, including short
and long grains. These sizes are further classified as basmati, jasmine, kainat
saila, ipsala, arborio, etc., catering to diverse culinary preferences and
cultural traditions. For both local and international trade, inspecting and
maintaining the quality of rice grains to satisfy customers and preserve a
country's reputation is necessary. Manual quality check and classification is
quite a laborious and time-consuming process. It is also highly prone to
mistakes. Therefore, an automatic solution must be proposed for the effective
and efficient classification of different varieties of rice grains. This
research paper presents an automatic framework based on a convolutional neural
network (CNN) for classifying different varieties of rice grains. We evaluated
the proposed model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, recall,
precision, and F1-Score. The CNN model underwent rigorous training and
validation, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate and a perfect area under each
class's Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The confusion matrix
analysis confirmed the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between the
different rice varieties, indicating minimal misclassifications. Additionally,
the integration of explainability techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provided
valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, revealing how
specific features of the rice grains influenced classification outcomes.

Conclusion: 网络图像数据可有效训练功能性抓取模型，仿真增强进一步提升了性能，实现了高效的仿真到现实迁移。

Abstract: Functional grasp is essential for enabling dexterous multi-finger robot hands
to manipulate objects effectively. However, most prior work either focuses on
power grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on
costly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each
object functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information
from web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions,
thereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human
hand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human
hand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its
accurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from
inexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To
further expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the
initially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to
generate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train
the grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects,
including challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs,
which are underrepresented in existing datasets. The model trained on the web
HOI dataset, achieving a 75.8% success rate on seen objects and 61.8% across
all objects in simulation, with a 6.7% improvement in success rate and a 1.8x
increase in functionality ratings over baselines. Simulator-augmented data
further boosts performance from 61.8% to 83.4%. The sim-to-real transfer to the
LEAP Hand achieves a 85% success rate. Project website is at:

TL;DR: PCVS方法通过逻辑规范和模糊处理实时视频流中的敏感对象，确保隐私保护，并在多个数据集中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护方法无法完全隐藏敏感对象且不适用于实时视频流，因此需要一种能实时保证隐私的方法。

Method: PCVS结合逻辑规范和检测模型，模糊处理敏感对象，并使用符合预测方法建立理论下界。

Result: PCVS在多个数据集中实现超过95%的规范满足率，且实际表现优于理论下界。

Conclusion: PCVS有效保护隐私且不影响机器人正常操作，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: Many robots (e.g., iRobot's Roomba) operate based on visual observations from
live video streams, and such observations may inadvertently include
privacy-sensitive objects, such as personal identifiers. Existing approaches
for preserving privacy rely on deep learning models, differential privacy, or
cryptography. They lack guarantees for the complete concealment of all
sensitive objects. Guaranteeing concealment requires post-processing techniques
and thus is inadequate for real-time video streams. We develop a method for
privacy-constrained video streaming, PCVS, that conceals sensitive objects
within real-time video streams. PCVS takes a logical specification constraining
the existence of privacy-sensitive objects, e.g., never show faces when a
person exists. It uses a detection model to evaluate the existence of these
objects in each incoming frame. Then, it blurs out a subset of objects such
that the existence of the remaining objects satisfies the specification. We
then propose a conformal prediction approach to (i) establish a theoretical
lower bound on the probability of the existence of these objects in a sequence
of frames satisfying the specification and (ii) update the bound with the
arrival of each subsequent frame. Quantitative evaluations show that PCVS
achieves over 95 percent specification satisfaction rate in multiple datasets,
significantly outperforming other methods. The satisfaction rate is
consistently above the theoretical bounds across all datasets, indicating that
the established bounds hold. Additionally, we deploy PCVS on robots in
real-time operation and show that the robots operate normally without being
compromised when PCVS conceals objects.

Conclusion: GaMNet在临床诊断中表现出更高的可靠性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that pose serious health risks. Deep
learning aids in lesion segmentation, but CNN and Transformer-based models
often lack context modeling or demand heavy computation, limiting real-time use
on mobile medical devices. We propose GaMNet, integrating the NMamba module for
global modeling and a multi-scale CNN for efficient local feature extraction.
To improve interpretability and mimic the human visual system, we apply Gabor
filters at multiple scales. Our method achieves high segmentation accuracy with
fewer parameters and faster computation. Extensive experiments show GaMNet
outperforms existing methods, notably reducing false positives and negatives,
which enhances the reliability of clinical diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为X-Transfer的新型攻击方法，揭示了CLIP模型中的通用对抗漏洞，通过动态选择代理模型实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CLIP模型在多样化下游任务和大型视觉语言模型中的应用增加，其对抗扰动的脆弱性成为关键问题。

Method: X-Transfer通过动态代理模型选择和通用对抗扰动（UAP）生成，实现跨数据、跨领域、跨模型和跨任务的攻击。

Result: X-Transfer显著优于现有UAP方法，为CLIP模型的对抗迁移性设定了新标准。

Conclusion: X-Transfer展示了CLIP模型的通用对抗漏洞，为未来防御研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly
adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language
models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as
a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel
attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP.
X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of
deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples,
tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super
transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain,
cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is
achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach.
Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are
computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate
scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates
from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a
new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is
publicly available in our
\href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Abstract: Lip segmentation plays a crucial role in various domains, such as lip
synchronization, lipreading, and diagnostics. However, the effectiveness of
supervised lip segmentation is constrained by the availability of lip contour
in the training phase. A further challenge with lip segmentation is its
reliance on image quality , lighting, and skin tone, leading to inaccuracies in
the detected boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a sequential
lip segmentation method that integrates attention UNet and multidimensional
input. We unravel the micro-patterns in facial images using local binary
patterns to build multidimensional inputs. Subsequently, the multidimensional
inputs are fed into sequential attention UNets, where the lip contour is
reconstructed. We introduce a mask generation method that uses a few anatomical
landmarks and estimates the complete lip contour to improve segmentation
accuracy. This mask has been utilized in the training phase for lip
segmentation. To evaluate the proposed method, we use facial images to segment
the upper lips and subsequently assess lip-related facial anomalies in subjects
with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Using the proposed lip segmentation method,
we achieved a mean dice score of 84.75%, and a mean pixel accuracy of 99.77% in
upper lip segmentation. To further evaluate the method, we implemented
classifiers to identify those with FAS. Using a generative adversarial network
(GAN), we reached an accuracy of 98.55% in identifying FAS in one of the study
populations. This method could be used to improve lip segmentation accuracy,
especially around Cupid's bow, and shed light on distinct lip-related
characteristics of FAS.

Motivation: 系统评估VLA模型在零样本泛化能力上的表现，尤其是在分布外环境中的性能。

Method: 通过MultiNet v0.2基准测试，评估包括GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、OpenVLA等在内的多种VLA和VLM模型在Procgen任务上的表现。

Result: 发现模型在零样本泛化上表现有限，VLA模型因架构设计更优而表现更好，VLM模型在适当约束下有明显改进。

Conclusion: VLA模型在泛化能力上优于其他模型，但所有模型仍需改进，提示工程对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models represent an important step toward
general-purpose robotic systems by integrating visual perception, language
understanding, and action execution. However, systematic evaluation of these
models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in
out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we
introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and
analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLM and VLA
models-including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA,Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST-on diverse
procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several
critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in
zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by
factors such as action representation and task complexit; (2) VLAs generally
outperform other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM
variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately,
highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt
engineering.

Motivation: 解决医疗AI数据稀缺问题，同时保护患者隐私。

Method: 比较了微调预训练大模型（FLUX、Kandinsky）与训练小型领域专用模型（MSDM），MSDM整合了临床文本编码器、变分自编码器和交叉注意力机制。

Abstract: The generation of realistic medical images from text descriptions has
significant potential to address data scarcity challenges in healthcare AI
while preserving patient privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive study of
text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct
approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2)
training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM,
an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical
text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better
align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two
approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus
training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy
(MedVQA-GI) and radiology (ROCOv2) datasets reveals that while large models
achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with
lower computational costs. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations by
medical experts reveal strengths and limitations of each approach.

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 是一种高效的实时高分辨率新视角合成技术，但点云冗余导致内存和性能问题。本文提出 SteepGS 框架，通过优化密度控制减少 50% 高斯点，提升效率。


<details>

Motivation: 3DGS 的点云冗余问题导致内存占用高、性能下降，限制了其在资源受限设备上的应用。

Method: 提出理论框架分析密度控制，优化高斯点的生成和参数更新，并引入 SteepGS 策略。

Result: SteepGS 减少 50% 高斯点，同时保持渲染质量，显著提升效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SteepGS 通过优化密度控制解决了 3DGS 的冗余问题，为资源受限设备提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for
real-time, high-resolution novel view synthesis. By representing scenes as a
mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for
efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture
fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional
points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting
in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands
- posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies
and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is
crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach,
we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal
number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction,
and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building
on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density
control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact
point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without
compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and
scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度强调全局约束和优化，忽略了局部信息（如细粒度空间交互和局部时间上下文），导致交互保真度和时间一致性不足。

Method: 提出GRFSQ（多尺度解耦运动表示）和BLC（局部块因果掩码采样策略），并结合Layer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance实现多尺度控制。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ReactDance表现优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReactDance通过多尺度表示和局部上下文策略，显著提升了反应性舞蹈生成的交互保真度和时间一致性。

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG) produces follower movements conditioned on
guiding dancer and music while ensuring spatial coordination and temporal
coherence. However, existing methods overemphasize global constraints and
optimization, overlooking local information, such as fine-grained spatial
interactions and localized temporal context. Therefore, we present ReactDance,
a novel diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity RDG with long-term
coherence and multi-scale controllability. Unlike existing methods that
struggle with interaction fidelity, synchronization, and temporal consistency
in duet synthesis, our approach introduces two key innovations: 1)Group
Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ), a multi-scale disentangled motion
representation that captures interaction semantics from coarse body rhythms to
fine-grained joint dynamics, and 2)Blockwise Local Context (BLC), a sampling
strategy eliminating error accumulation in long sequence generation via local
block causal masking and periodic positional encoding. Built on the decoupled
multi-scale GRFSQ representation, we implement a diffusion model
withLayer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance (LDCFG), allowing granular control
over motion semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that ReactDance surpasses existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验显示，运行时间加速8倍，深度误差降低48%。

Conclusion: QuickSplat通过数据驱动优化显著提升了重建效率和精度。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction is fundamental to computer vision and graphics,
enabling applications in 3D modeling, mixed reality, robotics, and more.
Existing approaches based on volumetric rendering obtain promising results, but
optimize on a per-scene basis, resulting in a slow optimization that can
struggle to model under-observed or textureless regions. We introduce
QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations
for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This
provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the
convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall
structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update
of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network
predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones,
removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on
large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our
data-driven optimization. Concretely, we accelerate runtime by 8x, while
decreasing depth errors by up to 48% in comparison to state of the art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 卫星图像中物体定位面临高变异性、低分辨率和噪声干扰等挑战，尤其是重力波、中层大气波和海洋涡旋等复杂场景。

Method: YOLO-DCAP引入多尺度扩张残差卷积块（MDRC）和注意力辅助空间池化模块（AaSP），以增强多尺度特征提取和全局空间区域关注。

Result: YOLO-DCAP在三个卫星数据集上平均mAP50提升20.95%，IoU提升32.23%，优于基准模型和现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-DCAP表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于复杂卫星图像中的物体定位，代码已开源。

Abstract: Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to
the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from
noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research,
we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW),
mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique
challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and
appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature
extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these
challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed
to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP
incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture
multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an
Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant
spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements
help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model
and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in
mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively
over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite
datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight
the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open

Result: GPT-4o输出视觉吸引力强，但像素级结构保真度不足；其作为视觉先验可显著提升现有去雾网络性能。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在图像修复中具有潜力，为未来研究提供基线框架和数据支持，有望推动图像生成领域的创新。

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-4o model, integrating multi-modal inputs and outputs within an
autoregressive architecture, has demonstrated unprecedented performance in
image generation. In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the
image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of
GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although
restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from
pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common
issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and
quantities, and changes in viewpoint.To address it, taking image dehazing,
derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show
that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially
enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical
guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o
into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image
restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation
areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images from
over 10 widely used image restoration datasets.

Abstract: Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central
challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail
to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our
approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual
understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this
capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the
model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual
insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior
multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream
analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well
as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary recognition remains a challenging problem in computer vision,
as it requires identifying objects from an unbounded set of categories. This is
particularly relevant in nature, where new species are discovered every year.
In this work, we focus on open-vocabulary bird species recognition, where the
goal is to classify species based on their descriptions without being
constrained to a predefined set of taxonomic categories. Traditional benchmarks
like CUB-200-2011 and Birdsnap have been evaluated in a closed-vocabulary
paradigm, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel
species continually emerge. We show that the performance of current systems
when evaluated under settings closely aligned with open-vocabulary drops by a
huge margin. To address this gap, we propose a scalable framework integrating
structured textual knowledge from Wikipedia articles of 11,202 bird species
distilled via GPT-4o into concise, discriminative summaries. We propose Visual
Re-ranking Retrieval-Augmented Generation(VR-RAG), a novel, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that uses visual similarities to rerank the top m
candidates retrieved by a set of multimodal vision language encoders. This
allows for the recognition of unseen taxa. Extensive experiments across five
established classification benchmarks show that our approach is highly
effective. By integrating VR-RAG, we improve the average performance of
state-of-the-art Large Multi-Modal Model QWEN2.5-VL by 15.4% across five
benchmarks. Our approach outperforms conventional VLM-based approaches, which
struggle with unseen species. By bridging the gap between encyclopedic
knowledge and visual recognition, our work advances open-vocabulary
recognition, offering a flexible, scalable solution for biodiversity monitoring
and ecological research.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique for applying the visual
characteristics of one image onto another while preserving structural content.
Traditionally used for artistic transformations, NST has recently been adapted,
e.g., for domain adaptation and data augmentation. This study investigates the
use of this technique for enhancing animal facial landmark detectors training.
As a case study, we use a recently introduced Ensemble Landmark Detector for 48
anatomical cat facial landmarks and the CatFLW dataset it was trained on,
making three main contributions. First, we demonstrate that applying style
transfer to cropped facial images rather than full-body images enhances
structural consistency, improving the quality of generated images. Secondly,
replacing training images with style-transferred versions raised challenges of
annotation misalignment, but Supervised Style Transfer (SST) - which selects
style sources based on landmark accuracy - retained up to 98% of baseline
accuracy. Finally, augmenting the dataset with style-transferred images further
improved robustness, outperforming traditional augmentation methods. These
findings establish semantic style transfer as an effective augmentation
strategy for enhancing the performance of facial landmark detection models for
animals and beyond. While this study focuses on cat facial landmarks, the
proposed method can be generalized to other species and landmark detection
models.

Abstract: Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines
but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we
identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D
reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning
problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn
shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital
elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports
flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting
DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D
reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters
and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model
learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more
input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric
normalization and co-registration.

Conclusion: 研究为RAG实践者在选择OCR-dependent或视觉嵌入系统时提供了实用指导，需权衡计算效率与语义准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular technique for
enhancing the reliability and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
grounding responses in external documents. Traditional RAG systems rely on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to first process scanned documents into
text. However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in
degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as
ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for
OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG
system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2
(90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional
retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark
to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that
while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on,
OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying
quality. We highlight the key trade-offs between computational efficiency and
semantic accuracy, offering practical guidance for RAG practitioners in
selecting between OCR-dependent and vision-based document retrieval systems in
production environments.

Abstract: Sparse volumetric reconstruction and rendering via 3D Gaussian splatting have
recently enabled animatable 3D head avatars that are rendered under arbitrary
viewpoints with impressive photorealism. Today, such photoreal avatars are seen
as a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality,
and entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex
non-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images;
due to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss
of fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts,
built from an individual facial expression. Also, recent state-of-the-art
models are often affected by memory limitations that reduce the number of 3D
Gaussians used for modeling, leading to lower detail and quality. To address
these problems, we present a new high-detail 3D head avatar model that improves
upon the state of the art, largely increasing the number of 3D Gaussians and
modeling quality for rendering at 4K resolution. Our high-quality model is
reconstructed from multiview input video and builds on top of a mesh-based 3D
morphable model, which provides a coarse deformation layer for the head.
Photoreal appearance is modelled by 3D Gaussians embedded within the continuous
UVD tangent space of this mesh, allowing for more effective densification where
most needed. Additionally, these Gaussians are warped by a novel UVD
deformation field to capture subtle, localized motion. Our key contribution is
the novel deformable Gaussian encoding and overall fitting procedure that
allows our head model to preserve appearance detail, while capturing facial
motion and other transient high-frequency features such as skin wrinkling.

pretrained text-to-image models still struggle in capturing the semantics
conveyed by complex prompts that compound multiple objects and instance-level
attributes. Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating
additional structural constraints, %leveraging additional structural inputs
typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation
process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural
guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image
generation models can directly provide a plausible \emph{fine-grained}
structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based
structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output
images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts,
instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究者通过微调预训练的视频-文本基础模型，开发了用于从野生卷尾猴视频中检索有用片段的计算模型，利用多模态大语言模型和视觉语言模型处理噪声数据，取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究野生卷尾猴行为需要从大量未标记视频中检索有用片段，但视频和音频数据噪声大，传统方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）自动化数据预处理管道提取干净的视频-文本对；2）通过LoRA微调预训练的X-CLIP模型。

Result: 在领域数据上，16帧模型的Hits@5提升167%，8帧模型提升114%；NDCG@K结果显示模型能有效排序行为，而原始预训练模型无法做到。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了从噪声数据中检索有用视频片段的能力，为野生动物行为研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Video recordings of nonhuman primates in their natural habitat are a common
source for studying their behavior in the wild. We fine-tune pre-trained
video-text foundational models for the specific domain of capuchin monkeys,
with the goal of developing useful computational models to help researchers to
retrieve useful clips from videos. We focus on the challenging problem of
training a model based solely on raw, unlabeled video footage, using weak audio
descriptions sometimes provided by field collaborators. We leverage recent
advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to address the extremely noisy nature of both video and audio content.
Specifically, we propose a two-folded approach: an agentic data treatment
pipeline and a fine-tuning process. The data processing pipeline automatically
extracts clean and semantically aligned video-text pairs from the raw videos,
which are subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained Microsoft's X-CLIP model
through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We obtained an uplift in $Hits@5$ of
$167\%$ for the 16 frames model and an uplift of $114\%$ for the 8 frame model
on our domain data. Moreover, based on $NDCG@K$ results, our model is able to
rank well most of the considered behaviors, while the tested raw pre-trained
models are not able to rank them at all. The code will be made available upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的基础模型HyperspectralMAE，通过双掩码策略（空间和光谱维度）预训练，结合谐波傅里叶位置嵌入，实现高光谱数据的鲁棒表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱数据的高维特性带来挑战，需要一种能够同时处理空间和光谱信息的模型。

Method: 采用双掩码策略（50%空间块和50%光谱带），结合谐波傅里叶位置嵌入和MSE+SAM重建目标。

Result: 模型在Indian Pines基准测试中达到最先进的迁移学习准确率。

Conclusion: 双掩码和波长感知嵌入显著提升了高光谱图像的重建和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectral detail but poses unique
challenges because of its high dimensionality in both spatial and spectral
domains. We propose \textit{HyperspectralMAE}, a Transformer-based foundation
model for hyperspectral data that employs a \textit{dual masking} strategy:
during pre-training we randomly occlude 50\% of spatial patches and 50\% of
spectral bands. This forces the model to learn representations capable of
reconstructing missing information across both dimensions. To encode spectral
order, we introduce learnable harmonic Fourier positional embeddings based on
wavelength. The reconstruction objective combines mean-squared error (MSE) with
the spectral angle mapper (SAM) to balance pixel-level accuracy and
spectral-shape fidelity.
  The resulting model contains about $1.8\times10^{8}$ parameters and produces
768-dimensional embeddings, giving it sufficient capacity for transfer
learning. We pre-trained HyperspectralMAE on two large hyperspectral corpora --
NASA EO-1 Hyperion ($\sim$1\,600 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel spectra)
and DLR EnMAP Level-0 ($\sim$1\,300 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel
spectra) -- and fine-tuned it for land-cover classification on the Indian Pines
benchmark. HyperspectralMAE achieves state-of-the-art transfer-learning
accuracy on Indian Pines, confirming that masked dual-dimensional pre-training
yields robust spectral-spatial representations. These results demonstrate that
dual masking and wavelength-aware embeddings advance hyperspectral image
reconstruction and downstream analysis.

Motivation: 现有基于查询的时序动作检测器直接沿用目标检测架构，导致多尺度特征冗余和时序上下文捕捉能力不足。

Method: 提出多扩张门控编码器替代多尺度可变形注意力编码器，减少冗余信息；引入中心-邻近区域集成解码器，优化采样策略。

Result: DiGIT在THUMOS14、ActivityNet v1.3和HACS-Segment上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DiGIT通过改进编码器和解码器设计，有效提升了时序动作检测的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we examine a key limitation in query-based detectors for
temporal action detection (TAD), which arises from their direct adaptation of
originally designed architectures for object detection. Despite the
effectiveness of the existing models, they struggle to fully address the unique
challenges of TAD, such as the redundancy in multi-scale features and the
limited ability to capture sufficient temporal context. To address these
issues, we propose a multi-dilated gated encoder and central-adjacent region
integrated decoder for temporal action detection transformer (DiGIT). Our
approach replaces the existing encoder that consists of multi-scale deformable
attention and feedforward network with our multi-dilated gated encoder. Our
proposed encoder reduces the redundant information caused by multi-level
features while maintaining the ability to capture fine-grained and long-range
temporal information. Furthermore, we introduce a central-adjacent region
integrated decoder that leverages a more comprehensive sampling strategy for
deformable cross-attention to capture the essential information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.3, and HACS-Segment. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SeDA的新方法，通过语义空间干预和双阶段扩散框架，逐步对齐视觉和文本特征，提升了跨模态分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过一步映射将视觉特征投影到文本特征分布，但由于两种模态在样本分布和特征值范围上的差异，难以实现有效对齐。

Method: SeDA利用语义空间作为桥梁，通过双阶段扩散框架（包括扩散控制语义学习器和翻译器）逐步对齐视觉和文本特征，并引入渐进特征交互网络。

Result: 实验表明，SeDA在跨模态特征对齐上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SeDA通过语义空间干预和渐进对齐，有效解决了跨模态特征对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an effective approach to improving visual
classification. Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses
deep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution
of textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such
a projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise
samples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method,
termed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual
projection, considering both types of features share the same class-level
information in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework
is developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities.
Specifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to
model the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the
interactive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual
features. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic
Translator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the
semantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network
introduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively
integrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show
that SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior
performance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.

TL;DR: SurgTracker是一种半监督框架，通过过滤自蒸馏方法将合成训练的点跟踪器适应于手术视频，解决了领域转移和标记数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集在点跟踪中取得了显著进展，但在实际手术视频中部署时，由于复杂的组织变形、遮挡和光照变化，领域转移和标记数据不足的问题尤为严重。

Method: SurgTracker采用固定教师模型在线生成伪标签，并通过循环一致性约束过滤不一致的轨迹，确保几何一致性和稳定的训练监督。

Result: 在STIR基准测试中，仅使用80个未标记视频，SurgTracker显著提升了跟踪性能。

Conclusion: SurgTracker展示了在高领域转移和数据稀缺环境中实现稳健适应的潜力。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets have enabled significant progress in point tracking by
providing large-scale, densely annotated supervision. However, deploying these
models in real-world domains remains challenging due to domain shift and lack
of labeled data-issues that are especially severe in surgical videos, where
scenes exhibit complex tissue deformation, occlusion, and lighting variation.
While recent approaches adapt synthetic-trained trackers to natural videos
using teacher ensembles or augmentation-heavy pseudo-labeling pipelines, their
effectiveness in high-shift domains like surgery remains unexplored. This work
presents SurgTracker, a semi-supervised framework for adapting
synthetic-trained point trackers to surgical video using filtered
self-distillation. Pseudo-labels are generated online by a fixed
teacher-identical in architecture and initialization to the student-and are
filtered using a cycle consistency constraint to discard temporally
inconsistent trajectories. This simple yet effective design enforces geometric
consistency and provides stable supervision throughout training, without the
computational overhead of maintaining multiple teachers. Experiments on the
STIR benchmark show that SurgTracker improves tracking performance using only
80 unlabeled videos, demonstrating its potential for robust adaptation in
high-shift, data-scarce domains.

Conclusion: Dome-DETR在性能和效率上均达到最优，模型轻量且高效。

Abstract: Tiny object detection plays a vital role in drone surveillance, remote
sensing, and autonomous systems, enabling the identification of small targets
across vast landscapes. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient
feature leverage and high computational costs due to redundant feature
processing and rigid query allocation. To address these challenges, we propose
Dome-DETR, a novel framework with Density-Oriented Feature-Query Manipulation
for Efficient Tiny Object Detection. To reduce feature redundancies, we
introduce a lightweight Density-Focal Extractor (DeFE) to produce clustered
compact foreground masks. Leveraging these masks, we incorporate Masked Window
Attention Sparsification (MWAS) to focus computational resources on the most
informative regions via sparse attention. Besides, we propose Progressive
Adaptive Query Initialization (PAQI), which adaptively modulates query density
across spatial areas for better query allocation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Dome-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance (+3.3 AP on
AI-TOD-V2 and +2.5 AP on VisDrone) while maintaining low computational
complexity and a compact model size. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有凝聚聚类方法需要额外参数且结果不稳定，缺乏先验知识时难以适应不同数据集。

Method: kFuse包含四个关键步骤：自然邻居划分子簇、边界连通性计算、密度相似性评估及合并规则制定。

Result: 实验证明kFuse在合成和真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: kFuse通过综合考量邻近样本、距离和密度，显著提升了聚类效果。

Abstract: Agglomerative clustering has emerged as a vital tool in data analysis due to
its intuitive and flexible characteristics. However, existing agglomerative
clustering methods often involve additional parameters for sub-cluster
partitioning and inter-cluster similarity assessment. This necessitates
different parameter settings across various datasets, which is undoubtedly
challenging in the absence of prior knowledge. Moreover, existing agglomerative
clustering techniques are constrained by the calculation method of connection
distance, leading to unstable clustering results. To address these issues, this
paper introduces a novel density-based agglomerative clustering method, termed
kFuse. kFuse comprises four key components: (1) sub-cluster partitioning based
on natural neighbors; (2) determination of boundary connectivity between
sub-clusters through the computation of adjacent samples and shortest
distances; (3) assessment of density similarity between sub-clusters via the
calculation of mean density and variance; and (4) establishment of merging
rules between sub-clusters based on boundary connectivity and density
similarity. kFuse requires the specification of the number of clusters only at
the final merging stage. Additionally, by comprehensively considering adjacent
samples, distances, and densities among different sub-clusters, kFuse
significantly enhances accuracy during the merging phase, thereby greatly
improving its identification capability. Experimental results on both synthetic
and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of kFuse.

Abstract: Automation can play a prominent role in improving efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability in infrastructure surveying and assessing construction and
compliance standards. This paper presents a framework for automation of
geometric measurements and compliance assessment using point cloud data. The
proposed approach integrates deep learning-based detection and segmentation, in
conjunction with geometric and signal processing techniques, to automate
surveying tasks. As a proof of concept, we apply this framework to
automatically evaluate the compliance of curb ramps with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), demonstrating the utility of point cloud data in survey
automation. The method leverages a newly collected, large annotated dataset of
curb ramps, made publicly available as part of this work, to facilitate robust
model training and evaluation. Experimental results, including comparison with
manual field measurements of several ramps, validate the accuracy and
reliability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to significantly
reduce manual effort and improve consistency in infrastructure assessment.
Beyond ADA compliance, the proposed framework lays the groundwork for broader
applications in infrastructure surveying and automated construction evaluation,
promoting wider adoption of point cloud data in these domains. The annotated
database, manual ramp survey data, and developed algorithms are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有局部描述模型未广泛应用于医学领域，而医学诊断依赖区域细节，因此需要专门解决方案。

Method: MedDAM利用大型视觉语言模型，结合专家设计的提示和评估协议，生成区域描述。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MedDAM表现优于主流模型，验证了区域语义对齐的重要性。

Conclusion: MedDAM为医学视觉语言集成提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Localized image captioning has made significant progress with models like the
Describe Anything Model (DAM), which can generate detailed region-specific
descriptions without explicit region-text supervision. However, such
capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical
imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings
rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the
first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for
region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical
expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes
a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data
pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark
evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models,
focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks,
thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in
medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and
SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including
GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and
OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic
alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising
foundation for clinical vision-language integration.

Result: 在基准数据集上，VM_TUNet的分割性能优于现有方法，尤其在精细边界划分上表现突出。

Conclusion: VM_TUNet成功结合了变分模型和深度学习的优势，为图像分割提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image segmentation methods, such as variational models based on
partial differential equations (PDEs), offer strong mathematical
interpretability and precise boundary modeling, but often suffer from
sensitivity to parameter settings and high computational costs. In contrast,
deep learning models such as UNet, which are relatively lightweight in
parameters, excel in automatic feature extraction but lack theoretical
interpretability and require extensive labeled data. To harness the
complementary strengths of both paradigms, we propose Variational Model Based
Tailored UNet (VM_TUNet), a novel hybrid framework that integrates the
fourth-order modified Cahn-Hilliard equation with the deep learning backbone of
UNet, which combines the interpretability and edge-preserving properties of
variational methods with the adaptive feature learning of neural networks.
Specifically, a data-driven operator is introduced to replace manual parameter
tuning, and we incorporate the tailored finite point method (TFPM) to enforce
high-precision boundary preservation. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that VM_TUNet achieves superior segmentation performance
compared to existing approaches, especially for fine boundary delineation.

Result: 在相同计算资源下优于现有方法，减少45%计算量且FID仅增加0.06。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，显著提升DiT的实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) models have achieved remarkable success in image
generation, thanks for their exceptional generative capabilities and
scalability. Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs)
results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment.
Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent
temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of
correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose
increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration,
where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model
itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction
failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect.
Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance
than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget.
When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45%
computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

Abstract: Ordinal regression bridges regression and classification by assigning objects
to ordered classes. While human experts rely on discriminative patch-level
features for decisions, current approaches are limited by the availability of
only image-level ordinal labels, overlooking fine-grained patch-level
characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Fuzzy Learning with
Patch Guidance framework, named DFPG that learns precise feature-based grading
boundaries from ambiguous ordinal labels, with patch-level supervision.
Specifically, we propose patch-labeling and filtering strategies to enable the
model to focus on patch-level features exclusively with only image-level
ordinal labels available. We further design a dual-level fuzzy learning module,
which leverages fuzzy logic to quantitatively capture and handle label
ambiguity from both patch-wise and channel-wise perspectives. Extensive
experiments on various image ordinal regression datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, further confirming its ability in
distinguishing samples from difficult-to-classify categories. The code is

Abstract: Knots in wood are critical to both aesthetics and structural integrity,
making their detection and pairing essential in timber processing. However,
traditional manual annotation was labor-intensive and inefficient,
necessitating automation. This paper proposes a lightweight and fully automated
pipeline for knot detection and pairing based on machine learning techniques.
In the detection stage, high-resolution surface images of wooden boards were
collected using industrial-grade cameras, and a large-scale dataset was
manually annotated and preprocessed. After the transfer learning, the YOLOv8l
achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.887. In the pairing stage, detected knots were
analyzed and paired based on multidimensional feature extraction. A triplet
neural network was used to map the features into a latent space, enabling
clustering algorithms to identify and pair corresponding knots. The triplet
network with learnable weights achieved a pairing accuracy of 0.85. Further
analysis revealed that he distances from the knot's start and end points to the
bottom of the wooden board, and the longitudinal coordinates play crucial roles
in achieving high pairing accuracy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness
of the proposed solution, demonstrating the potential of AI in advancing wood
science and industry.

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在RefRef数据集上的表现远不及oracle方法，凸显了任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: RefRef数据集和基准为折射和反射场景的重建提供了新工具，现有方法仍需改进。

Abstract: Modern 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis approaches have
demonstrated strong performance on scenes with opaque Lambertian objects.
However, most assume straight light paths and therefore cannot properly handle
refractive and reflective materials. Moreover, datasets specialized for these
effects are limited, stymieing efforts to evaluate performance and develop
suitable techniques. In this work, we introduce a synthetic RefRef dataset and
benchmark for reconstructing scenes with refractive and reflective objects from
posed images. Our dataset has 50 such objects of varying complexity, from
single-material convex shapes to multi-material non-convex shapes, each placed
in three different background types, resulting in 150 scenes. We also propose
an oracle method that, given the object geometry and refractive indices,
calculates accurate light paths for neural rendering, and an approach based on
this that avoids these assumptions. We benchmark these against several
state-of-the-art methods and show that all methods lag significantly behind the
oracle, highlighting the challenges of the task and dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散渲染的多功能感知屏幕图像压缩方法（PICD），适用于屏幕和自然图像，通过分层条件信息集成提升文本和图像的压缩质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有感知图像压缩方法在处理屏幕内容（如文本）时会产生明显伪影，需要一种既能处理屏幕内容又能处理自然图像的通用压缩方法。

Method: 提出PICD框架，将文本和图像分别编码，并通过扩散模型渲染为一张图像。扩散渲染分为三个层次的条件信息集成：领域级微调、适配器级控制和实例级指导。

Result: PICD在文本准确性和感知质量上优于现有感知编解码器，同时也能作为自然图像的感知编解码器。

Conclusion: PICD是一种高效的多功能压缩方法，适用于屏幕和自然图像，显著提升了压缩质量。

Abstract: Recently, perceptual image compression has achieved significant advancements,
delivering high visual quality at low bitrates for natural images. However, for
screen content, existing methods often produce noticeable artifacts when
compressing text. To tackle this challenge, we propose versatile perceptual
screen image compression with diffusion rendering (PICD), a codec that works
well for both screen and natural images. More specifically, we propose a
compression framework that encodes the text and image separately, and renders
them into one image using diffusion model. For this diffusion rendering, we
integrate conditional information into diffusion models at three distinct
levels: 1). Domain level: We fine-tune the base diffusion model using text
content prompts with screen content. 2). Adaptor level: We develop an efficient
adaptor to control the diffusion model using compressed image and text as
input. 3). Instance level: We apply instance-wise guidance to further enhance
the decoding process. Empirically, our PICD surpasses existing perceptual
codecs in terms of both text accuracy and perceptual quality. Additionally,
without text conditions, our approach serves effectively as a perceptual codec
for natural images.

*Hongyu Rui,Yinzhe Wu,Fanwen Wang,Jiahao Huang,Liutao Yang,Zi Wang,Guang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化多对比超分辨率（MCSR）框架，无需配对训练数据，支持任意放大倍数，通过无配对跨模态合成和无监督超分辨率两阶段实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI的多对比特性为跨模态增强提供了机会，但现有方法依赖配对数据且分辨率固定，难以适应临床环境。

Method: 分两阶段：无配对跨模态合成（U-CMS）和无监督超分辨率（U-SR），利用隐式神经表示（INRs）实现尺度无关的解剖学忠实重建。

Result: 在4倍和8倍放大下表现优于现有基线，具有更高的保真度和解剖学一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实临床环境中具有可扩展、个性化且数据高效的应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is critical for clinical diagnostics but is
often limited by long acquisition times and low signal-to-noise ratios,
especially in modalities like diffusion and functional MRI. The multi-contrast
nature of MRI presents a valuable opportunity for cross-modal enhancement,
where high-resolution (HR) modalities can serve as references to boost the
quality of their low-resolution (LR) counterparts-motivating the development of
Multi-Contrast Super-Resolution (MCSR) techniques. Prior work has shown that
leveraging complementary contrasts can improve SR performance; however,
effective feature extraction and fusion across modalities with varying
resolutions remains a major challenge. Moreover, existing MCSR methods often
assume fixed resolution settings and all require large, perfectly paired
training datasets-conditions rarely met in real-world clinical environments. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel Modular Multi-Contrast
Super-Resolution (MCSR) framework that eliminates the need for paired training
data and supports arbitrary upscaling. Our method decouples the MCSR task into
two stages: (1) Unpaired Cross-Modal Synthesis (U-CMS), which translates a
high-resolution reference modality into a synthesized version of the target
contrast, and (2) Unsupervised Super-Resolution (U-SR), which reconstructs the
final output using implicit neural representations (INRs) conditioned on
spatial coordinates. This design enables scale-agnostic and anatomically
faithful reconstruction by bridging un-paired cross-modal synthesis with
unsupervised resolution enhancement. Experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance at 4x and 8x upscaling, with improved fidelity and
anatomical consistency over existing baselines. Our framework demonstrates
strong potential for scalable, subject-specific, and data-efficient MCSR in
real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: FaSDiff是一种基于稳定扩散先验的面部图像压缩方法，通过频率增强保持一致性，在低比特率下提升重建图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部图像压缩方法在低比特率下重建质量不佳，且高频信息保留不足，影响下游应用。

Method: FaSDiff结合高频敏感压缩器和低频增强模块，利用扩散先验优化视觉提示和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明FaSDiff在人类视觉质量和机器视觉准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaSDiff通过频率增强和扩散先验，有效平衡了视觉质量和机器性能。

Abstract: With the widespread application of facial image data across various domains,
the efficient storage and transmission of facial images has garnered
significant attention. However, the existing learned face image compression
methods often produce unsatisfactory reconstructed image quality at low bit
rates. Simply adapting diffusion-based compression methods to facial
compression tasks results in reconstructed images that perform poorly in
downstream applications due to insufficient preservation of high-frequency
information. To further explore the diffusion prior in facial image
compression, we propose Facial Image Compression with a Stable Diffusion Prior
(FaSDiff), a method that preserves consistency through frequency enhancement.
FaSDiff employs a high-frequency-sensitive compressor in an end-to-end
framework to capture fine image details and produce robust visual prompts.
Additionally, we introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that
disentangles low-frequency facial semantics and stably modulates the diffusion
prior alongside visual prompts. The proposed modules allow FaSDiff to leverage
diffusion priors for superior human visual perception while minimizing
performance loss in machine vision due to semantic inconsistency. Extensive
experiments show that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing
human visual quality and machine vision accuracy. The code will be released
after the paper is accepted.

TL;DR: DINOv2模型的注意力图存在因冗余信息存储导致的伪影，影响性能和可解释性。引入寄存器标记后，虽然注意力图更清晰，但全局与局部特征仍脱节。研究发现CLS标记也有类似问题，需谨慎解释大型ViT的注意力图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DINOv2模型中因冗余信息存储导致的注意力图伪影问题，提升模型性能和可解释性。

Method: 引入寄存器标记存储全局信息，分析其对全局与局部特征关系的影响，并探讨CLS标记的类似现象。

Result: 寄存器标记使注意力图更清晰，但全局信息主要由寄存器标记提取，导致局部与全局特征脱节。CLS标记也有类似问题。

Conclusion: 需谨慎解释大型ViT的注意力图，明确寄存器标记和CLS标记的问题，为设计更可解释的视觉模型提供方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2
model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance
on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch
tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image
information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been
incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We
carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship
between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens
yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the
integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global
information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading
to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings,
we show that the CLS token itself, which can be interpreted as a register,
leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens.
Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of
large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behaviour to register
and CLS tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.

interacting with automotive infotainment systems, enabling seamless adaptation
across different UI designs. To further support research in this field, we
release AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset of 998 images with 4,208

closely matching or even surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and
web, such as ShowUI, despite being trained for the infotainment domain. This
research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead
to AI-driven progress within automotive UI understanding and interaction. The
applied method is cost-efficient and fine-tuned models can be deployed on

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要关注结构特征，而忽略了异常原因。论文希望通过模拟异常产生的内部和外部纠正力，更全面地解决3D异常检测问题。

Method: 1. 提出多样异常生成模块（DA-Gen）模拟多种异常；2. 设计纠正力预测网络（CFP-Net）生成点级纠正力；3. 提出对称损失和整体损失约束纠正力。

Result: 在提出的数据集和现有五个数据集上，实现了九个最优性能，且参数最少、推理速度最快。

Conclusion: MC4AD框架通过力学互补和纠正力模拟，显著提升了3D异常检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms
and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most
anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from
internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct
the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly
detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each
point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to
simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction
Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level
representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external
corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss
and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a
highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively,
creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision
and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance
to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained
nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest
inference speed. The source is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法未考虑边界像素和低类别像素区域的上下文特征信息不均问题，导致误分类。

Method: 设计了图像级和类别级特征均衡模块，结合Swin Transformer和CNN架构，增强像素特征表示。

Result: 在多个数据集（BUSI、ISIC2017、ACDC和PH²）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的双特征均衡网络有效解决了特征信息不均问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Current methods for medical image segmentation primarily focus on extracting
contextual feature information from the perspective of the whole image. While
these methods have shown effective performance, none of them take into account
the fact that pixels at the boundary and regions with a low number of class
pixels capture more contextual feature information from other classes, leading
to misclassification of pixels by unequal contextual feature information. In
this paper, we propose a dual feature equalization network based on the hybrid
architecture of Swin Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, aiming to
augment the pixel feature representations by image-level equalization feature
information and class-level equalization feature information. Firstly, the
image-level feature equalization module is designed to equalize the contextual
information of pixels within the image. Secondly, we aggregate regions of the
same class to equalize the pixel feature representations of the corresponding
class by class-level feature equalization module. Finally, the pixel feature
representations are enhanced by learning weights for image-level equalization
feature information and class-level equalization feature information. In
addition, Swin Transformer is utilized as both the encoder and decoder, thereby
bolstering the ability of the model to capture long-range dependencies and
spatial correlations. We conducted extensive experiments on Breast Ultrasound
Images (BUSI), International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC2017), Automated
Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) and PH$^2$ datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that our method have achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 无人机跟踪在现实机器人应用中至关重要，但轻量级网络集成常导致网络容量显著下降，加剧遮挡和视角变化等挑战。

Result: 在三个无人机跟踪基准测试中，CGTrack实现了最先进的性能，同时保持高速运行。

Conclusion: CGTrack通过创新的模块设计，有效解决了无人机跟踪中的网络容量问题，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: Recent advancements in visual object tracking have markedly improved the
capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, which is a critical
component in real-world robotics applications. While the integration of
hierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing
efficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network
capacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as
frequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these
issues, we introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which
combines explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a
coarse-to-fine framework. Specifically, we first introduce a Hierarchical
Feature Cascade (HFC) module that leverages the spirit of feature reuse to
increase network capacity by integrating the deep semantic cues with the rich
spatial information, incurring minimal computational costs while enhancing
feature representation. Based on this, we design a novel Lightweight Gated
Center Head (LGCH) that utilizes gating mechanisms to decouple target-oriented
coordinates from previously expanded features, which contain dense local
discriminative information. Extensive experiments on three challenging UAV
tracking benchmarks demonstrate that CGTrack achieves state-of-the-art
performance while running fast. Code will be available at

Conclusion: TripSE机制在CNN模型中具有广泛适用性，特别是在ConvNeXt架构中表现优异，为FER任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of ConvNeXt and its variants has reaffirmed the conceptual and
structural suitability of CNN-based models for vision tasks, re-establishing
them as key players in image classification in general, and in facial
expression recognition (FER) in particular. In this paper, we propose a new set
of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of
attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with
Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and
ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study
shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their
performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its
utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four
datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where
ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of
\textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.

Result: 在5个基准测试中取得最优性能。

Conclusion: Task-Adapter++通过双重适配和细粒度对齐，显著提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in language
and image tasks, leading an increasing number of studies to explore the
application of pre-trained image models, such as CLIP, in the domain of
few-shot action recognition (FSAR). However, current methods generally suffer
from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the
generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of
task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic
order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing
cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal
information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient
dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make
full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design
a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most
discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction.
Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed
sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce
semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the
sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an
innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps
visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions.
Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5
benchmarks consistently. The code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of machine learning models provides
valuable insights into the task, the data, and the reasons behind a model's
failures. In this work, we propose a method that performs inherently
interpretable predictions through the instance-wise sparsification of input
images. To align the sparsification with human perception, we learn the masking
in the space of semantically meaningful pixel regions rather than on
pixel-level. Additionally, we introduce an explicit way to dynamically
determine the required level of sparsity for each instance. We show empirically
on semi-synthetic and natural image datasets that our inherently interpretable
classifier produces more meaningful, human-understandable predictions than
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: Deformed document image rectification is essential for real-world document
understanding tasks, such as layout analysis and text recognition. However,
current multi-task methods -- such as background removal, 3D coordinate
prediction, and text line segmentation -- often overlook the complementary
features between tasks and their interactions. To address this gap, we propose
a self-adaptive learnable multi-task fusion rectification network named
SalmRec. This network incorporates an inter-task feature aggregation module
that adaptively improves the perception of geometric distortions, enhances
feature complementarity, and reduces negative interference. We also introduce a
gating mechanism to balance features both within global tasks and between local
tasks effectively. Experimental results on two English benchmarks (DIR300 and
DocUNet) and one Chinese benchmark (DocReal) demonstrate that our method
significantly improves rectification performance. Ablation studies further
highlight the positive impact of different tasks on dewarping and the
effectiveness of our proposed module.

Abstract: Cephalometric landmark detection is essential for orthodontic diagnostics and
treatment planning. Nevertheless, the scarcity of samples in data collection
and the extensive effort required for manual annotation have significantly
impeded the availability of diverse datasets. This limitation has restricted
the effectiveness of deep learning-based detection methods, particularly those
based on large-scale vision models. To address these challenges, we have
developed an innovative data generation method capable of producing diverse
cephalometric X-ray images along with corresponding annotations without human
intervention. To achieve this, our approach initiates by constructing new
cephalometric landmark annotations using anatomical priors. Then, we employ a
diffusion-based generator to create realistic X-ray images that correspond
closely with these annotations. To achieve precise control in producing samples
with different attributes, we introduce a novel prompt cephalometric X-ray
image dataset. This dataset includes real cephalometric X-ray images and
detailed medical text prompts describing the images. By leveraging these
detailed prompts, our method improves the generation process to control
different styles and attributes. Facilitated by the large, diverse generated
data, we introduce large-scale vision detection models into the cephalometric
landmark detection task to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that training with the generated data substantially enhances the performance.
Compared to methods without using the generated data, our approach improves the
Success Detection Rate (SDR) by 6.5%, attaining a notable 82.2%. All code and

models frequently yield low-fidelity images due to their inability to
adequately capture morphological intricacies, which can critically compromise
the robustness and reliability of segmentation models. To alleviate this
limitation, we introduce Siamese-Diffusion, a novel dual-component model
comprising Mask-Diffusion and Image-Diffusion. During training, a Noise
Consistency Loss is introduced between these components to enhance the
morphological fidelity of Mask-Diffusion in the parameter space. During
sampling, only Mask-Diffusion is used, ensuring diversity and scalability.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.
Siamese-Diffusion boosts SANet's mDice and mIoU by 3.6% and 4.4% on the Polyps,
while UNet improves by 1.52% and 1.64% on the ISIC2018. Code is available at

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems have traditionally relied on costly
LiDAR sensors to generate precise environmental representations. In this paper,
we propose a camera-only perception framework that produces Bird's Eye View
(BEV) maps by extending the Lift-Splat-Shoot architecture. Our method combines
YOLOv11-based object detection with DepthAnythingV2 monocular depth estimation
across multi-camera inputs to achieve comprehensive 360-degree scene
understanding. We evaluate our approach on the OpenLane-V2 and NuScenes
datasets, achieving up to 85% road segmentation accuracy and 85-90% vehicle
detection rates when compared against LiDAR ground truth, with average
positional errors limited to 1.2 meters. These results highlight the potential
of deep learning to extract rich spatial information using only camera inputs,
enabling cost-efficient autonomous navigation without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: 提出PDIG，结合语义概念嵌入（SCE）和轻量级工业风格适配器（LISA），利用文本-图像双空间约束（TIDSC）提升生成质量。

Result: PDIG在FID指标上优于第二名19.16分，显著提升下游缺陷检测性能。

Conclusion: PDIG通过结合稳定扩散和领域适配技术，有效解决了光伏缺陷数据稀缺问题，生成图像质量高且多样。

Abstract: Accurate defect detection of photovoltaic (PV) cells is critical for ensuring
quality and efficiency in intelligent PV manufacturing systems. However, the
scarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model
training. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment
datasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain
shifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image
Generator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors
learned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited
data. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic Concept Embedding (SCE) module that
incorporates text-conditioned priors to capture the relational concepts between
defect types and their appearances. To further enrich the domain distribution,
we design a Lightweight Industrial Style Adaptor (LISA), which injects
industrial defect characteristics into the SD model through cross-disentangled
attention. At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC)
module, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency
and spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG
achieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Specifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16
points over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance
of downstream defect detection tasks.

Motivation: 脑部病变分割在医学影像中具有重要性和挑战性，现有方法在多模态数据利用、小病变敏感性和自动化分割方面存在局限性。

Method: BrainSegDMLF模型包含动态模态交互融合模块（DMIF）、逐层上采样解码器和自动分割掩码生成功能。

Result: 模型能够更全面地整合多模态数据，提高对小病变的检测能力，并实现全自动分割。

Conclusion: BrainSegDMLF模型在脑部病变分割任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The segmentation of substantial brain lesions is a significant and
challenging task in the field of medical image segmentation. Substantial brain
lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries
between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices
are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of
abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex.
Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on
single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information
commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire
brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective
integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a
holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of
data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in
detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on
external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some
extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed
a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for
brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following
features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and
integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM
encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling
Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features
even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3)
Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks
automatically without requiring manual prompts.

Conclusion: MM-Skin和SkinVL为皮肤病VLM的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as clinical
assistants across various medical fields. However, specialized dermatology VLM
capable of delivering professional and detailed diagnostic analysis remains
underdeveloped, primarily due to less specialized text descriptions in current
dermatology multimodal datasets. To address this issue, we propose MM-Skin, the
first large-scale multimodal dermatology dataset that encompasses 3 imaging
modalities, including clinical, dermoscopic, and pathological and nearly 10k
high-quality image-text pairs collected from professional textbooks. In
addition, we generate over 27k diverse, instruction-following vision question
answering (VQA) samples (9 times the size of current largest dermatology VQA
dataset). Leveraging public datasets and MM-Skin, we developed SkinVL, a
dermatology-specific VLM designed for precise and nuanced skin disease
interpretation. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations of SkinVL on VQA,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and zero-shot classification tasks across 8
datasets, reveal its exceptional performance for skin diseases in comparison to
both general and medical VLM models. The introduction of MM-Skin and SkinVL
offers a meaningful contribution to advancing the development of clinical
dermatology VLM assistants. MM-Skin is available at

TL;DR: DiffLocks是一种新框架，通过合成大规模头发数据集和扩散-变换器模型，直接从单张图像重建多种详细3D发型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因数据不足和低维表示限制，难以重建复杂发型（如卷发），需后处理。DiffLocks旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 创建包含40K发型的合成数据集；2. 使用扩散-变换器模型从单张图像生成3D发丝，无需后处理。

Result: DiffLocks首次实现从单张图像重建高度卷曲发型（如非洲发型），且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: DiffLocks通过创新数据生成和模型设计，显著提升了单图像3D头发重建的多样性和细节表现。

Abstract: We address the task of generating 3D hair geometry from a single image, which
is challenging due to the diversity of hairstyles and the lack of paired
image-to-3D hair data. Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data
and cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional
intermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings,
that require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These
approaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are
limited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we
propose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a
wide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the
lack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair
dataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic
hair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that
generates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a
pretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite
being trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp
texture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an
individual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without
post-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide
strands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of
complex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like
afro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time. Data and code is
available at https://radualexandru.github.io/difflocks/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SAM在图像分割任务中表现出色，但其在医学图像分类中的应用尚未充分探索，因此需要一种有效的适配方法。

Method: 利用SAM编码器提取特征，结合提出的SLCA机制计算空间局部注意力权重，并将其集成到分类模型中。

Result: 在三个公开医学图像分类数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将SAM适配于医学图像分类，并通过SLCA机制显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have shown strong performance in various vision tasks, particularly
image segmentation, due to their impressive zero-shot segmentation
capabilities. However, effectively adapting such models for medical image
classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a
new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize
the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based
features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image,
while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next,
we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to
compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The
features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to
compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning
classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or
meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance.
Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于View Introspection Network (VIN)的Next Best View (NBV)算法，通过预测视图对重建质量的直接改进来选择最优视图，显著提升了3D重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NBV算法通常依赖场景先验知识或最大化覆盖率，但在复杂几何和自遮挡场景中，覆盖率最大化并不直接提升重建质量。

Method: 设计了VIN网络，通过3D感知特征化和模仿学习预测视图改进分数，结合贪婪策略选择最优视图。

Result: VIN-NBV在有限采集次数或时间约束下，重建质量比基线方法提升约30%。

Conclusion: VIN-NBV通过直接预测视图改进分数，显著提升了复杂场景下的3D重建效率和质量。

Abstract: Next Best View (NBV) algorithms aim to acquire an optimal set of images using
minimal resources, time, or number of captures to enable efficient 3D
reconstruction of a scene. Existing approaches often rely on prior scene
knowledge or additional image captures and often develop policies that maximize
coverage. Yet, for many real scenes with complex geometry and self-occlusions,
coverage maximization does not lead to better reconstruction quality directly.
In this paper, we propose the View Introspection Network (VIN), which is
trained to predict the reconstruction quality improvement of views directly,
and the VIN-NBV policy. A greedy sequential sampling-based policy, where at
each acquisition step, we sample multiple query views and choose the one with
the highest VIN predicted improvement score. We design the VIN to perform
3D-aware featurization of the reconstruction built from prior acquisitions, and
for each query view create a feature that can be decoded into an improvement
score. We then train the VIN using imitation learning to predict the
reconstruction improvement score. We show that VIN-NBV improves reconstruction
quality by ~30% over a coverage maximization baseline when operating with
constraints on the number of acquisitions or the time in motion.

Motivation: 传统修图工具操作保守但专业，而生成式编辑易失控。MLLM有望结合两者优势，提供可控且专业的修图方案。

Method: 训练MLLM通过视觉谜题理解图像处理操作，并基于专家编辑数据合成推理数据集，用于微调模型以规划和执行编辑序列。

Conclusion: MLLM在修图中展现出可控性和专业性的潜力，适合需要身份保留的场景。

Abstract: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs.
Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible
to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in
unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional
procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,
Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.
Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual
procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In
this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to
critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them
with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate
that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing
operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.
Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit
sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we
synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits
and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize
reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by
construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and
resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a
variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and
identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural
alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via
our project website at https://monetgpt.github.io.

Abstract: Rigging and skinning are essential steps to create realistic 3D animations,
often requiring significant expertise and manual effort. Traditional attempts
at automating these processes rely heavily on geometric heuristics and often
struggle with objects of complex geometry. Recent data-driven approaches show
potential for better generality, but are often constrained by limited training
data. We present the Anymate Dataset, a large-scale dataset of 230K 3D assets
paired with expert-crafted rigging and skinning information -- 70 times larger
than existing datasets. Using this dataset, we propose a learning-based
auto-rigging framework with three sequential modules for joint, connectivity,
and skinning weight prediction. We systematically design and experiment with
various architectures as baselines for each module and conduct comprehensive
evaluations on our dataset to compare their performance. Our models
significantly outperform existing methods, providing a foundation for comparing
future methods in automated rigging and skinning. Code and dataset can be found

Motivation: 解决层次文本分类中标注数据不足、标签空间大和长尾分布的问题。

Result: 在WoS、DBpedia和Amazon数据集上显著优于基线，尤其在深层标签上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结合结构化知识能有效应对层次文本分类的挑战。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) involves assigning documents to labels
organized within a taxonomy. Most previous research on HTC has focused on
supervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC
can be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces
issues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we
present Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification
(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by
integrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide
structured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves
relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to
understand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on
three open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental
results show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the
strict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at
deeper levels of the hierarchy. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of incorporating structured knowledge into LLMs to address HTC's challenges in
large label spaces and long-tailed label distributions. Our code is available

Motivation: 研究如何在保护隐私的前提下，通过Transformer模型提升语言建模的性能，同时优化模型大小和运行效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在通用数据上训练种子模型，再用差分隐私在输入数据上微调；同时缩小GPT2架构以适应需求。

Result: 模型在预测和准确性上表现优于现有GRU模型，同时内存和速度开销增加可控。

Conclusion: 通过差分隐私和两阶段训练，成功实现了高效且隐私保护的Transformer语言模型。

Abstract: In this paper we train a transformer using differential privacy (DP) for
language modeling in SwiftKey. We run multiple experiments to balance the
trade-off between the model size, run-time speed and accuracy. We show that we
get small and consistent gains in the next-word-prediction and accuracy with
graceful increase in memory and speed compared to the production GRU. This is
obtained by scaling down a GPT2 architecture to fit the required size and a two
stage training process that builds a seed model on general data and DP
finetunes it on typing data. The transformer is integrated using ONNX offering
both flexibility and efficiency.

Result: 民主党更关注疫情伤亡和医疗建议，共和党更注重政治责任和媒体更新。

Conclusion: 提出一种基于分类算法的系统方法，通过COVID-19相关术语预测推文的政治立场。

Abstract: The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected the political
scene worldwide and the introduction of new terminology and public opinions
regarding the virus has further polarized partisan stances. Using a collection
of tweets gathered from leading American political figures online (Republican
and Democratic), we explored the partisan differences in approach, response,
and attitude towards handling the international crisis. Implementation of the
bag-of-words, bigram, and TF-IDF models was used to identify and analyze
keywords, topics, and overall sentiments from each party. Results suggest that
Democrats are more concerned with the casualties of the pandemic, and give more
medical precautions and recommendations to the public whereas Republicans are
more invested in political responsibilities such as keeping the public updated
through media and carefully watching the progress of the virus. We propose a
systematic approach to predict and distinguish a tweet's political stance (left
or right leaning) based on its COVID-19 related terms using different
classification algorithms on different language models.

Motivation: 研究监督和偏好微调技术在虚假相关性（如偏差或数据集伪影）下的表现，以优化大语言模型的对齐效果。

Method: 在数学推理、指令遵循和文档问答等任务中，比较SFT、DPO和KTO在不同虚假相关性条件下的性能。

Result: 偏好方法（DPO/KTO）在数学推理中表现稳健，而SFT在复杂任务中更优；虚假相关性高时模型性能普遍下降。

Conclusion: 后训练策略的选择需根据任务类型和虚假相关性特征，无通用最优方法。

Abstract: Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness
criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious
correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut"
features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms --
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO
(Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and
spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained
instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the
degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of
artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results
show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness.
The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in
mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance
in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single
post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best
choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious
correlations.

Result: 视觉信息提升了翻译性能，但域外场景表现不佳；全局上下文能有效改善翻译效果。

Conclusion: TopicVD数据集和提出的MMT模型为视频支持的MMT研究提供了新方向，但需进一步优化领域适应方法。

Abstract: Most existing multimodal machine translation (MMT) datasets are predominantly
composed of static images or short video clips, lacking extensive video data
across diverse domains and topics. As a result, they fail to meet the demands
of real-world MMT tasks, such as documentary translation. In this study, we
developed TopicVD, a topic-based dataset for video-supported multimodal machine
translation of documentaries, aiming to advance research in this field. We
collected video-subtitle pairs from documentaries and categorized them into
eight topics, such as economy and nature, to facilitate research on domain
adaptation in video-guided MMT. Additionally, we preserved their contextual
information to support research on leveraging the global context of
documentaries in video-guided MMT. To better capture the shared semantics
between text and video, we propose an MMT model based on a cross-modal
bidirectional attention module. Extensive experiments on the TopicVD dataset
demonstrate that visual information consistently improves the performance of
the NMT model in documentary translation. However, the MMT model's performance
significantly declines in out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for
effective domain adaptation methods. Additionally, experiments demonstrate that
global context can effectively improve translation performance. % Dataset and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 插入语言模型（ILMs）通过任意位置插入令牌解决自回归模型（ARMs）和掩码扩散模型（MDMs）在复杂约束和顺序依赖上的不足，表现优于两者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARMs和MDMs在处理复杂约束或非顺序依赖序列时存在局限性，需要一种更灵活的生成方法。

Method: 提出ILMs，通过联合选择插入位置和词汇元素，一次插入一个令牌，并采用定制网络参数化和去噪目标进行训练。

Result: ILMs在规划任务中优于ARMs和MDMs，在无条件文本生成任务中与ARMs相当，同时在任意长度文本填充中比MDMs更灵活。

Conclusion: ILMs提供了一种灵活且高效的序列生成方法，特别适用于复杂约束和非顺序依赖的场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one
``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range
of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent
sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential
dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion
Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking
multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs
cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be
filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion
Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in
a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary
element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent
strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in
arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token
dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs,
we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising
objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs
and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform
MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task
while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text
infilling.

*Zehao Fan,Garrett Gagnon,Zhenyu Liu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARC是一种针对PIM架构优化的稀疏数据映射方案，通过语义相似性聚类KV对，显著减少LLM解码时的延迟和能耗，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自回归解码时因KV缓存的内存访问压力导致性能瓶颈，现有PIM架构难以处理动态稀疏访问模式。

Method: STARC通过聚类KV对并按语义相似性映射到连续内存区域，利用预计算中心点实现选择性注意力，减少数据移动和负载不均衡。

Result: 在HBM-PIM系统上，STARC减少注意力层延迟19%-31%，能耗19%-27%，并在KV缓存限制下实现更显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: STARC有效支持PIM架构上的高效长上下文LLM推理，兼具硬件友好性和模型精度。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but
their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language
models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent
memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in
memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory
(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth
and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily
optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access
patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they
suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization.
In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme
tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC
clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory
regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve
relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed
centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without
frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM
system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces
attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a
KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and
45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC
maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and
hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AnaQuest是一种创新的提示技术，用于通过预训练大语言模型生成多选题（MCQs），其选项为复杂概念的句子级断言。该技术结合了形成性和总结性评估，生成的问题在难度和区分度上更接近人工编写的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够生成高质量多选题的技术，以支持教育评估，同时减少人工编写问题的负担。

Method: AnaQuest通过分析学生对开放问题的回答生成正确和错误的断言，形成多选题。使用IRT比较AnaQuest、ChatGPT和人工编写问题的特性。

Result: 专家认为AnaQuest和ChatGPT生成的问题与人工编写的问题同样有效，但AnaQuest生成的问题在难度和区分度上更接近人工编写的问题。

Conclusion: AnaQuest是一种有效的多选题生成技术，尤其在生成错误选项（干扰项）方面表现优于ChatGPT，更接近人工编写的问题。

Abstract: The primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative
prompting technique, AnaQuest, for generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
using a pre-trained large language model. In AnaQuest, the choice items are
sentence-level assertions about complex concepts. The technique integrates
formative and summative assessments. In the formative phase, students answer
open-ended questions for target concepts in free text. For summative
assessment, AnaQuest analyzes these responses to generate both correct and
incorrect assertions. To evaluate the validity of the generated MCQs, Item
Response Theory (IRT) was applied to compare item characteristics between MCQs
generated by AnaQuest, a baseline ChatGPT prompt, and human-crafted items. An
empirical study found that expert instructors rated MCQs generated by both AI
models to be as valid as those created by human instructors. However, IRT-based
analysis revealed that AnaQuest-generated questions - particularly those with
incorrect assertions (foils) - more closely resembled human-crafted items in
terms of difficulty and discrimination than those produced by ChatGPT.

*Junhyeong Lee,Jong Min Yuk,Chan-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的混合文本挖掘框架，结合多步和直接方法的优势，将非结构化科学文本转化为结构化数据，并通过引入实体标记器提升实体识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多步和直接方法在独立应用时存在局限性，需要一种更高效的方法来提取科学文献中的结构化数据。

Method: 提出混合框架，先将原始文本转化为实体识别的文本，再转化为结构化形式，并引入实体标记器提升性能。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，实体识别性能显著优于现有方法，实体级F1分数提升58%，关系级F1分数提升83%。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了两种方法的优势，显著提升了结构化数据的质量和性能。

Abstract: The construction of experimental datasets is essential for expanding the
scope of data-driven scientific discovery. Recent advances in natural language
processing (NLP) have facilitated automatic extraction of structured data from
unstructured scientific literature. While existing approaches-multi-step and
direct methods-offer valuable capabilities, they also come with limitations
when applied independently. Here, we propose a novel hybrid text-mining
framework that integrates the advantages of both methods to convert
unstructured scientific text into structured data. Our approach first
transforms raw text into entity-recognized text, and subsequently into
structured form. Furthermore, beyond the overall data structuring framework, we
also enhance entity recognition performance by introducing an entity marker-a
simple yet effective technique that uses symbolic annotations to highlight
target entities. Specifically, our entity marker-based hybrid approach not only
consistently outperforms previous entity recognition approaches across three
benchmark datasets (MatScholar, SOFC, and SOFC slot NER) but also improve the
quality of final structured data-yielding up to a 58% improvement in
entity-level F1 score and up to 83% improvement in relation-level F1 score
compared to direct approach.

Result: EWC不仅有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，还对新任务学习有潜在益处。

Conclusion: EWC在大语言模型的持续学习中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This technical report describes an experiment on autoregressive pre-training
of Gemma2 2 billion parameter large language model (LLM) with 10\% on the
Lithuanian language component of CulturaX from the point of view of continual

consisting of Arc, Belebele, Gsm8K, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande
sets (both in English and Lithuanian versions), and perplexity benchmarks. We
empirically demonstrate that EWC regularisation allows us not only to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting effects but also that it is potentially beneficial for
learning of the new task with LLMs.

Motivation: 为法律专家提供自动化工具以简化长法律文档的摘要工作。

Method: 微调解码器大语言模型，并在训练前为判决添加法律实体信息。

Result: 引入法律实体有助于模型找到相关内容，但生成的摘要质量未达实际应用标准。

Conclusion: 当前方法虽有潜力，但需进一步提升摘要质量以满足实际需求。

Abstract: The automated summarisation of long legal documents can be a great aid for
legal experts in their daily work. We automatically create summaries (guiding
principles) of German judgments by fine-tuning a decoder-based large language
model. We enrich the judgments with information about legal entities before the
training. For the evaluation of the created summaries, we define a set of
evaluation classes which allows us to measure their language, pertinence,
completeness and correctness. Our results show that employing legal entities
helps the generative model to find the relevant content, but the quality of the
created summaries is not yet sufficient for a use in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeoQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在检索增强生成（RAG）中的表现，通过虚构新闻事件和实体确保模型无法依赖预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试容易过时，难以区分模型是基于检索还是预训练知识回答问题。

Method: 构建虚构新闻事件的时间线和知识库，生成问答对，确保模型仅依赖检索到的证据回答问题。

Result: LLM在问题与证据间细微不匹配时表现不佳，且在证据缺失时容易走捷径。

Conclusion: NeoQA揭示了LLM在基于证据推理中的关键局限性，为未来研究提供了新平台。

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models
(LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions
initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge
as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making
it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce
NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark
designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and
knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles
and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring
that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as
a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires
LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when
sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across
various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details.
Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches
between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key
information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence,
underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互式语言学习的训练方法，通过单轮对话中的奖励机制模拟儿童语言习得，但尚未在语言评估中观察到显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受儿童语言习得启发，探索交互式学习对语言模型训练的潜在益处。

Method: 使用强化学习微调语言模型，通过问答任务中的奖励信号间接评估语法性。

Result: 实验显示通信约束能改变说话者行为，但语言评估未提升。

Conclusion: 未来可通过改进任务设计和训练配置，进一步验证交互学习对语言模型的效果。

Abstract: We propose a method for training language models in an interactive setting
inspired by child language acquisition. In our setting, a speaker attempts to
communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and
receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related
work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we
operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only
question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study
demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality.
Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune
language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the
communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior.
However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our
training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and
training configuration that could better position future work to use our
methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in
computational cognitive models.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于嵌入的语义透明度测量方法及其对阅读的影响，通过聚类分析和线性判别分析验证了这些方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义透明度在词汇识别中至关重要，但其计算操作化仍存在争议。研究旨在探索基于嵌入的语义透明度测量方法及其对阅读的影响。

Method: 研究对4,226个马来语前缀词进行了t-SNE聚类分析，并提出了五种简单测量方法。通过线性判别分析和广义加性混合模型验证这些方法的预测能力。

Result: 所有测量方法均能预测词汇决策延迟，其中与词群中心的相关性测量方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的语义透明度测量方法有效，且与词群中心的相关性是最佳预测指标。

Abstract: Studies of morphological processing have shown that semantic transparency is
crucial for word recognition. Its computational operationalization is still
under discussion. Our primary objectives are to explore embedding-based
measures of semantic transparency, and assess their impact on reading. First,
we explored the geometry of complex words in semantic space. To do so, we
conducted a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering analysis on
4,226 Malay prefixed words. Several clusters were observed for complex words
varied by their prefix class. Then, we derived five simple measures, and
investigated whether they were significant predictors of lexical decision
latencies. Two sets of Linear Discriminant Analyses were run in which the
prefix of a word is predicted from either word embeddings or shift vectors
(i.e., a vector subtraction of the base word from the derived word). The
accuracy with which the model predicts the prefix of a word indicates the
degree of transparency of the prefix. Three further measures were obtained by
comparing embeddings between each word and all other words containing the same
prefix (i.e., centroid), between each word and the shift from their base word,
and between each word and the predicted word of the Functional Representations
of Affixes in Compositional Semantic Space model. In a series of Generalized
Additive Mixed Models, all measures predicted decision latencies after
accounting for word frequency, word length, and morphological family size. The
model that included the correlation between each word and their centroid as a
predictor provided the best fit to the data.

multilingual grammatical error correction tasks. We list six models that
improve grammatical correctness in all four languages and show that Gemma 9B is
currently the best performing one for the languages considered.

Motivation: 解决在遵守GDPR等数据隐私法规时，选择性遗忘特定信息同时保持模型整体效用的挑战。

Method: 动态调整目标logits，利用当前模型输出生成更准确的自蒸馏目标，避免静态超参数或初始模型输出的依赖。

Result: 在公共基准和内部电商数据集上表现优异，平衡遗忘与保留目标，优于NPO和UnDIAL等方法。

Conclusion: Unilogit在多种场景中表现出鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值和高效的机器遗忘能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Unilogit, a novel self-distillation method for machine
unlearning in Large Language Models. Unilogit addresses the challenge of
selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model
utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.
Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model
outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform
probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for
more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the
need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to
approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and
an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit's superior performance in
balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit's robustness
across various scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and
effectiveness in achieving efficacious machine unlearning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为PubHealthBench的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在英国政府公共卫生信息上的表现，发现最新私有模型在多项选择题上表现优异，但在自由回答中仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，了解其在特定领域（如公共卫生）的知识准确性变得至关重要，尤其是在可能影响公众健康的情况下。

Method: 通过自动化流程创建了包含8000多个问题的基准PubHealthBench，评估了24个LLMs在多项选择题和自由回答中的表现。

Result: 最新私有LLMs（如GPT-4.5）在多项选择题上表现优异（>90%），但在自由回答中表现较差（<75%）。

Conclusion: 尽管先进LLMs在公共卫生信息上表现良好，但在自由回答中仍需额外保障措施。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed
understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for
successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health,
where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could
significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM
knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue,
this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions
for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form
responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also
release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance
documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on
PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a
high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform
humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see
lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are
promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate
source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still
be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

Motivation: 探讨微调BERT模型在语义和句法任务中对MWEs的注意力分配是否不同，以及这种分配如何受任务类型影响。

Method: 使用六种印欧语言的单语模型和数据集，分析预训练和微调BERT模型对MWEs的注意力分数。

Result: 微调显著影响模型对MWEs的注意力分配：语义任务模型更均匀关注习语，句法任务模型在低层更关注MSUs。

Conclusion: 任务类型决定了BERT模型对MWEs的注意力分配模式，语义和句法任务分别对应不同的注意力分布。

Abstract: This study analyzes the attention patterns of fine-tuned encoder-only models
based on the BERT architecture (BERT-based models) towards two distinct types
of Multiword Expressions (MWEs): idioms and microsyntactic units (MSUs). Idioms
present challenges in semantic non-compositionality, whereas MSUs demonstrate
unconventional syntactic behavior that does not conform to standard grammatical
categorizations. We aim to understand whether fine-tuning BERT-based models on
specific tasks influences their attention to MWEs, and how this attention
differs between semantic and syntactic tasks. We examine attention scores to
MWEs in both pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT-based models. We utilize
monolingual models and datasets in six Indo-European languages - English,
German, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. Our results show that
fine-tuning significantly influences how models allocate attention to MWEs.
Specifically, models fine-tuned on semantic tasks tend to distribute attention
to idiomatic expressions more evenly across layers. Models fine-tuned on
syntactic tasks show an increase in attention to MSUs in the lower layers,
corresponding with syntactic processing requirements.

Abstract: This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI
dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text,
audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality,
extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model
achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682
F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in
capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization
(lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and
robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in
modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise
sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or
enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by
effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment
analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs
have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify
the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they
need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM
conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in
user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,
fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale
simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn
settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs
we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations
than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.
Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance
degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant
increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early
turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly
rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a
conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自适应微调、对比学习和正则化优化的策略，以提升基于Transformer的模型在少样本文本分类任务中的性能。实验表明，该方法在FewRel 2.0数据集上表现优异，尤其在5-shot设置下能更有效地捕捉文本特征并提高分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本文本分类在低资源环境中具有重要应用价值，但标准交叉熵损失难以学习区分模糊语义边界或复杂特征分布的类别。

Method: 结合自适应微调、对比学习和正则化优化，引入对比损失和正则化损失以增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明T5-small、DeBERTa-v3和RoBERTa-base在少样本任务中表现良好，尤其在5-shot设置下效果显著。

Conclusion: 使用具有更强自注意力机制的Transformer模型或生成架构有助于提升少样本分类的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot text classification has important application value in low-resource
environments. This paper proposes a strategy that combines adaptive
fine-tuning, contrastive learning, and regularization optimization to improve
the classification performance of Transformer-based models. Experiments on the
FewRel 2.0 dataset show that T5-small, DeBERTa-v3, and RoBERTa-base perform
well in few-shot tasks, especially in the 5-shot setting, which can more
effectively capture text features and improve classification accuracy. The
experiment also found that there are significant differences in the
classification difficulty of different relationship categories. Some categories
have fuzzy semantic boundaries or complex feature distributions, making it
difficult for the standard cross entropy loss to learn the discriminative
information required to distinguish categories. By introducing contrastive loss
and regularization loss, the generalization ability of the model is enhanced,
effectively alleviating the overfitting problem in few-shot environments. In
addition, the research results show that the use of Transformer models or
generative architectures with stronger self-attention mechanisms can help
improve the stability and accuracy of few-shot classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估多语言大语言模型（如LLaMA、Aya等）在零样本和少样本提示下检测仇恨言论的效果，发现其泛化能力优于微调编码器模型，但提示设计对性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视语言多样性，多语言大语言模型的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 在八种非英语语言中评估LLM提示技术，并与微调编码器模型对比。

Result: 零样本和少样本提示在真实数据集上表现较差，但在泛化测试中优于微调模型；提示设计对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 多语言LLM在仇恨言论检测中具有潜力，但需针对不同语言优化提示设计。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing
approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual
instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ
offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in
identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains
underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight
non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing
them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot
prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world
evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for
hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a
critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting
techniques to maximize performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑数据组成的大语言模型（LLM）微调缩放定律，发现数据集体积（样本数和平均长度）对性能有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅以总token数衡量训练数据，忽视了数据组成（样本数和平均长度）对模型性能的关键作用。

Method: 通过实验在BRICC和MMLU数据集上验证数据组成对token效率的影响，并调整缩放定律。

Result: 数据组成显著影响token效率，为资源受限的LLM微调提供了更精细的缩放定律。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据组成的重要性，为实际应用中的LLM微调提供了更有效的指导。

Abstract: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under
fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition.
Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the
number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset
volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned
following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset
\cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset
\cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple
subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects
token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM
fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NLP的多维框架，用于客观分类心理咨询中的参与质量，通过多种特征和分类器实现高准确率，并展示了数据增强后的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客户与治疗师之间的参与是治疗成功的关键因素，需要一种客观评估参与质量的方法。

Method: 使用253份心理咨询文本，提取42个特征（对话动态、语义相似性、情感分类、问题检测），并通过多种分类器（RF、Cat-Boost、SVM）进行训练和评估。

Result: 在平衡数据上，RF和SVM表现最佳；数据增强后性能显著提升，RF达到88.9%准确率和94.6% AUC。

Conclusion: 该框架具有扩展性，支持未来多模态扩展，为临床提供实时反馈，提升治疗质量。

Abstract: Engagement between client and therapist is a critical determinant of
therapeutic success. We propose a multi-dimensional natural language processing
(NLP) framework that objectively classifies engagement quality in counseling
sessions based on textual transcripts. Using 253 motivational interviewing
transcripts (150 high-quality, 103 low-quality), we extracted 42 features
across four domains: conversational dynamics, semantic similarity as topic
alignment, sentiment classification, and question detection. Classifiers,
including Random Forest (RF), Cat-Boost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM),
were hyperparameter tuned and trained using a stratified 5-fold
cross-validation and evaluated on a holdout test set. On balanced
(non-augmented) data, RF achieved the highest classification accuracy (76.7%),
and SVM achieved the highest AUC (85.4%). After SMOTE-Tomek augmentation,
performance improved significantly: RF achieved up to 88.9% accuracy, 90.0%
F1-score, and 94.6% AUC, while SVM reached 81.1% accuracy, 83.1% F1-score, and
93.6% AUC. The augmented data results reflect the potential of the framework in
future larger-scale applications. Feature contribution revealed conversational
dynamics and semantic similarity between clients and therapists were among the
top contributors, led by words uttered by the client (mean and standard
deviation). The framework was robust across the original and augmented datasets
and demonstrated consistent improvements in F1 scores and recall. While
currently text-based, the framework supports future multimodal extensions
(e.g., vocal tone, facial affect) for more holistic assessments. This work
introduces a scalable, data-driven method for evaluating engagement quality of
the therapy session, offering clinicians real-time feedback to enhance the
quality of both virtual and in-person therapeutic interactions.

Abstract: Extracting scientific evidence from biomedical studies for clinical research
questions (e.g., Does stem cell transplantation improve quality of life in
patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease compared to placebo?) is a
crucial step in synthesising biomedical evidence. In this paper, we focus on
the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical
questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset
called CochraneForest, leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic
reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research
questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on
CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique
challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms
the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the
results also underscore the complexity of CochraneForest, establishing it as a
challenging testbed for advancing automated evidence synthesis systems.

Motivation: 由于隐私问题，大多数网络和数字追踪数据不包含国籍信息，这给移民研究带来了挑战，尤其是左删失问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了移民研究中的左删失问题，尤其适用于学术劳动力多样化的国家。

Abstract: Most web and digital trace data do not include information about an
individual's nationality due to privacy concerns. The lack of data on
nationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a
left-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of
origin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can
differentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the
nationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the
detected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which
is a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6
million unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into
families of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training
data. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1
score of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level
categorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to
assign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our
results show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for
nationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries
with a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.
We found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once
we used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic
origin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has
consistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have
Chinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin. Our proposed
methods for addressing left-censoring issues are beneficial for other research
that uses digital trace data to study migration.

Conclusion: 该技术为未来在同步辐射设施中开展活体患者PCT乳腺癌成像奠定了基础，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed human cancer in the United
States at present. Early detection is crucial for its successful treatment.
X-ray mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are currently the main
methods for breast cancer screening. However, both have known limitations in
terms of their sensitivity and specificity to breast cancers, while also
frequently causing patient discomfort due to the requirement for breast
compression. Breast computed tomography is a promising alternative, however, to
obtain high-quality images, the X-ray dose needs to be sufficiently high. As
the breast is highly radiosensitive, dose reduction is particularly important.
Phase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) has been shown to produce
higher-quality images at lower doses and has no need for breast compression. It
is demonstrated in the present study that, when imaging full fresh mastectomy
samples with PCT, deep learning-based image denoising can further reduce the
radiation dose by a factor of 16 or more, without any loss of image quality.
The image quality has been assessed both in terms of objective metrics, such as
spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio, as well as in an observer study
by experienced medical imaging specialists and radiologists. This work was
carried out in preparation for live patient PCT breast cancer imaging,
initially at specialized synchrotron facilities.

Motivation: 量子计算为神经网络架构提供了新机遇，但当前NISQ设备的硬件限制阻碍了QCNN的实际应用。

Method: 提出一种编码方案降低输入维度，并设计自动化框架优化QCNN的构建模块（PQCs）。

Result: 在49量子比特的QCNN上直接处理MNIST图像，分类准确率达96.08%，超越传统方法的71.74%。

Conclusion: 研究验证了量子计算在图像分类中的潜力，为未来量子神经网络的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: While classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized
image classification, the emergence of quantum computing presents new
opportunities for enhancing neural network architectures. Quantum CNNs (QCNNs)
leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform
classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware
limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an
encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We
demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to
directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for
classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an
automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity
characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum
circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and
convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs
and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum
processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the
$71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training
conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image
classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum
computing in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in
generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control and
prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs
poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in
safety-critical scenarios. Existing black-box methods often detect
hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of
these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing
detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a
confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case
study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing
sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. We then
propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt
perturbations using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that
cause language models to act with high uncertainty. By generating MCTS prompt
perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show that offline analyses can
be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model
uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM.

Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a
significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of
large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by
researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy
generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively
collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation
data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or
missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework
that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or
generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data
is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on
visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using
MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust
navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and
outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a
fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents,
validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even
amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in 3D requires learning an $N$ degree-of-freedom joint
space trajectory of a robot manipulator. Robots must possess semantic and
visual perception abilities to transform real-world mappings of their workspace
into the low-level control necessary for object manipulation. Recent work has
demonstrated the capabilities of fine-tuning large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to learn the mapping between RGB images, language instructions, and
joint space control. These models typically take as input RGB images of the
workspace and language instructions, and are trained on large datasets of
teleoperated robot demonstrations. In this work, we explore methods to improve
the scene context awareness of a popular recent Vision-Language-Action model by
integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, depth perception, and task-oriented
region of interest detection. Our experiments in the LIBERO simulation
environment show that our proposed model, 3D-CAVLA, improves the success rate
across various LIBERO task suites, achieving an average success rate of
98.1$\%$. We also evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our method,
demonstrating that 3D scene awareness leads to robust learning and adaptation
for completely unseen tasks. 3D-CAVLA achieves an absolute improvement of
8.8$\%$ on unseen tasks. We will open-source our code and the unseen tasks

Abstract: Preference feedback collected by human or VLM annotators is often noisy,
presenting a significant challenge for preference-based reinforcement learning

propose TREND, a novel framework that integrates few-shot expert demonstrations
with a tri-teaching strategy for effective noise mitigation. Our method trains
three reward models simultaneously, where each model views its small-loss
preference pairs as useful knowledge and teaches such useful pairs to its peer
network for updating the parameters. Remarkably, our approach requires as few
as one to three expert demonstrations to achieve high performance. We evaluate
TREND on various robotic manipulation tasks, achieving up to 90% success rates
even with noise levels as high as 40%, highlighting its effective robustness in
handling noisy preference feedback. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人形机器人研究在徒步任务中存在不足：运动技能缺乏长期目标和情境感知，而语义导航忽视了实际环境和地形变化。

Method: LEGO-H框架结合了时间视觉变换器和分层强化学习，预测未来局部目标以指导运动，并通过潜在运动模式表示和分层度量学习实现策略迁移。

Conclusion: 徒步任务成为体现自主性的重要测试平台，LEGO-H为未来人形机器人发展提供了基准。

Abstract: Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive
decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains
fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills
without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation
overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose
training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill
development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We
develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid
robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical
innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals
to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed
navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with
hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable
smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These
components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges
without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied
simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and
robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy
and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development.

demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder
their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome
these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular
prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to
guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make
interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves
three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to
generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations,
providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc
Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations
generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from
candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM
Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as
in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the
performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs.
Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average
accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse
domains.

Motivation: 现有方法在算法上存在局限性且分析流程分散，难以有效检测生物医学研究中的学术不端行为。

Method: BMMDetect整合了期刊元数据（如SJR指数）、语义嵌入（PubMedBERT）和GPT-4o挖掘的文本属性（如方法学统计和数据异常），通过多模态融合减少检测偏差。

Conclusion: BMMDetect为研究诚信保护提供了可扩展且可解释的工具，显著提升了学术不端行为的检测能力。

Abstract: Academic misconduct detection in biomedical research remains challenging due
to algorithmic narrowness in existing methods and fragmented analytical
pipelines. We present BMMDetect, a multimodal deep learning framework that
integrates journal metadata (SJR, institutional data), semantic embeddings
(PubMedBERT), and GPT-4o-mined textual attributes (methodological statistics,
data anomalies) for holistic manuscript evaluation. Key innovations include:
(1) multimodal fusion of domain-specific features to reduce detection bias; (2)
quantitative evaluation of feature importance, identifying journal authority
metrics (e.g., SJR-index) and textual anomalies (e.g., statistical outliers) as
dominant predictors; and (3) the BioMCD dataset, a large-scale benchmark with
13,160 retracted articles and 53,411 controls. BMMDetect achieves 74.33% AUC,
outperforming single-modality baselines by 8.6%, and demonstrates
transferability across biomedical subfields. This work advances scalable,
interpretable tools for safeguarding research integrity.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型如何依赖虚假相关性（捷径）进行决策，并提出了一种新方法（HTA）来检测和缓解这种问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型中捷径的处理机制，以理解其如何影响预测结果。

Method: 使用电影评论中的演员名称作为可控捷径，通过机制解释方法识别相关注意力头，并提出HTA方法追踪输入标记。

Result: 发现特定注意力头会提前依赖捷径做出决策，HTA能有效检测并缓解这种问题。

Conclusion: HTA为理解和干预语言模型中的捷径依赖提供了新工具。

Abstract: Reliance on spurious correlations (shortcuts) has been shown to underlie many
of the successes of language models. Previous work focused on identifying the
input elements that impact prediction. We investigate how shortcuts are
actually processed within the model's decision-making mechanism. We use actor
names in movie reviews as controllable shortcuts with known impact on the
outcome. We use mechanistic interpretability methods and identify specific
attention heads that focus on shortcuts. These heads gear the model towards a
label before processing the complete input, effectively making premature
decisions that bypass contextual analysis. Based on these findings, we
introduce Head-based Token Attribution (HTA), which traces intermediate
decisions back to input tokens. We show that HTA is effective in detecting
shortcuts in LLMs and enables targeted mitigation by selectively deactivating
shortcut-related attention heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪扩散模型（DDMs）在生成任务中表现出色，但其表征学习效率不足。本文旨在扩展DDMs的表征能力，使其适用于更广泛的深度学习任务。

Method: 采用多级去噪自编码器框架，引入时序一致的扩散变换器和时间步依赖的编码器，通过自条件扩散学习获取嵌入表征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的嵌入在语义上优于现有自监督学习方法，且在大多数情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: DDMs不仅适用于生成任务，还具有在通用深度学习任务中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Generative models capture the true distribution of data, yielding
semantically rich representations. Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit
superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for
them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder
framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces
sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional
timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the
denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning.
Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process,
compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under
different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across
all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through
this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets,
demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases,
achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work
justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also
potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.

Result: 在血液细胞分类数据集上表现优于原始KAN，且在不同超参数下均表现稳定。

Conclusion: ECOC显著提升了KAN在医疗图像多分类任务中的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offer universal function approximation using
univariate spline compositions without nonlinear activations. In this work, we
integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to
transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving
robustness via Hamming-distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC method
outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset,
achieving higher accuracy under diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation
studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across
FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration
significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI
applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of
ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单纯计算Wasserstein距离或分析其传输图可能不足以理解导致距离高低的具体因素。

Method: 基于可解释AI的解决方案，将Wasserstein距离归因于数据子组、输入特征或可解释子空间。

Result: 方法在多种数据集和Wasserstein距离规范下表现出高准确性，并通过两个用例验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解Wasserstein距离的贡献因素提供了有效工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances provide a powerful framework for comparing data
distributions. They can be used to analyze processes over time or to detect
inhomogeneities within data. However, simply calculating the Wasserstein
distance or analyzing the corresponding transport map (or coupling) may not be
sufficient for understanding what factors contribute to a high or low
Wasserstein distance. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on
Explainable AI that allows us to efficiently and accurately attribute
Wasserstein distances to various data components, including data subgroups,
input features, or interpretable subspaces. Our method achieves high accuracy
across diverse datasets and Wasserstein distance specifications, and its
practical utility is demonstrated in two use cases.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method MTL-Swin-Unet which is multi-task learning using
transformers for classification and semantic segmentation. For
spurious-correlation problems, this method allows us to enhance the image
representation with two other image representations: representation obtained by
semantic segmentation and representation obtained by image reconstruction. In
our experiments, the proposed method outperformed in F-value measure than other
classifiers when the test data included slices from the same patient (no
covariate shift). Similarly, when the test data did not include slices from the
same patient (covariate shift setting), the proposed method outperformed in AUC
measure.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的ECG去噪框架ECGDeDRDNet，采用双循环密集网络架构，结合ECG波形和估计的干净图像信息，显著提升了去噪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号常受基线漂移、肌肉伪影和电极运动等噪声干扰，影响诊断效果，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 使用LSTM层与DenseNet块结合的双循环架构，迭代利用ECG波形和估计的干净图像信息。

Result: 在MIT-BIH数据集上，PSNR和SSIM优于传统图像去噪方法，SNR和RMSE优于经典ECG去噪技术。

Conclusion: ECGDeDRDNet通过双循环架构有效结合时空信息，显著提升了ECG去噪性能。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are frequently corrupted by noise, such as
baseline wander (BW), muscle artifacts (MA), and electrode motion (EM), which
significantly degrade their diagnostic utility. To address this issue, we
propose ECGDeDRDNet, a deep learning-based ECG Denoising framework leveraging a
Double Recurrent Dense Network architecture. In contrast to traditional
approaches, we introduce a double recurrent scheme to enhance information reuse
from both ECG waveforms and the estimated clean image. For ECG waveform
processing, our basic model employs LSTM layers cascaded with DenseNet blocks.
The estimated clean ECG image, obtained by subtracting predicted noise
components from the noisy input, is iteratively fed back into the model. This
dual recurrent architecture enables comprehensive utilization of both temporal
waveform features and spatial image details, leading to more effective noise
suppression. Experimental results on the MIT-BIH dataset demonstrate that our
method achieves superior performance compared to conventional image denoising
methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM while also surpassing classical ECG denoising
techniques in both SNR and RMSE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素基模型存在高计算成本、慢收敛和伪影等长期问题，且可能被忽视的近似性、周期性和零空间特性问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的傅里叶域基展开模型，替代传统的图像域体素基方法。

Result: 在非笛卡尔MRI重建中，新模型减少了伪影并降低了计算复杂度，提高了收敛速度。

Conclusion: 新模型在图像质量和计算效率方面优于传统方法，为解决长期问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: For the past several decades, it has been popular to reconstruct Fourier
imaging data using model-based approaches that can easily incorporate physical
constraints and advanced regularization/machine learning priors. The most
common modeling approach is to represent the continuous image as a linear
combination of shifted "voxel" basis functions. Although well-studied and
widely-deployed, this voxel-based model is associated with longstanding
limitations, including high computational costs, slow convergence, and a
propensity for artifacts. In this work, we reexamine this model from a fresh
perspective, identifying new issues that may have been previously overlooked
(including undesirable approximation, periodicity, and nullspace
characteristics). Our insights motivate us to propose a new model that is more
resilient to the limitations (old and new) of the previous approach.
Specifically, the new model is based on a Fourier-domain basis expansion rather
than the standard image-domain voxel-based approach. Illustrative results,
which are presented in the context of non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction,
demonstrate that the new model enables improved image quality (reduced
artifacts) and/or reduced computational complexity (faster computations and
improved convergence).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用LLM丰富的语言表达能力，扩展进化博弈论和基于代理的模型，研究词汇在空间环境中的进化与多样性。

Method: 代理在空间环境中移动，携带由LLM生成的短词或短语，交互结果由LLM根据词汇关系决定，失败者的词汇被替换，并可能发生词汇突变。

Result: 初步实验显示，从已知物种初始种群中，物种以渐进和间断平衡方式涌现，最终形成多样化的优势种群。长期实验展示了多样物种的共存。

Conclusion: 模型成功展示了词汇进化的多样性和适应性，验证了LLM在模拟复杂生态演化中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to
extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich
linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the
emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among
agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase)
generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become
adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on
the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by
the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We
conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would
survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of
well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated
equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse
populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as
terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically
specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted
a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and
coexistence of diverse species.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的两阶段用户画像方法，通过领域定义语句生成可解释的用户画像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像技术缺乏可迁移性、可解释性，且依赖大量标注数据或固定类别，限制了适应性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 半监督过滤结合领域知识库；2) 生成抽象和抽取式用户画像，利用LLM知识减少人工标注需求。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在波斯政治Twitter数据集上比现有方法性能提升9.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成灵活、适应性强且可解释的用户画像，适用于多种社交网络任务。

Abstract: Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks
like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring,
and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including
tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation
learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability,
produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on
rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large
language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements,
which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain
as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs
semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates
both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative
tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with
minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while
reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates
interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data
into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for
downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X)
dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation.
Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in
creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.

Conclusion: 本文方法为深度模型的可适应和高效部署提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural
networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct
generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen
during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves
effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its
broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that
extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with
minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe
comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies
for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain
competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a
scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptMeta通过整合元语义和关系信息，提升了少样本知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) has obtained significant attention
due to its practical applications in real-world scenarios, where new knowledge
often emerges with limited available data. While most existing methods for
few-shot KGC have predominantly focused on leveraging relational information,
rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To address this
gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that
seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot
KGC. PrompMeta has two key innovations: (1) a meta-semantic prompt pool that
captures and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective
knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations. (2) a
learnable fusion prompt that dynamically combines meta-semantic information
with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks.
Both components are optimized together with model parameters within a
meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 概念中心框架为智能体的多任务学习和跨领域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can
learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a
vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object,
relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation
outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel
concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and
reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of
symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such
neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to
solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos,
3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework
offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional
generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer.

Result: 在SemArt和Artpedia数据集上，ArtRAG表现优于基线模型，人类评估确认其生成内容更具文化深度和连贯性。

Conclusion: ArtRAG通过结构化知识和检索增强生成，显著提升了艺术品解释的质量和丰富性。

Abstract: Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives --
cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While
recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image
captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine
art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines
structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art
Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing
entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich,
interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever
selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation.
This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art
descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG
outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further
confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched
interpretations.

Abstract: Combining natural language and geometric shapes is an emerging research area
with multiple applications in robotics and language-assisted design. A crucial
task in this domain is object referent identification, which involves selecting
a 3D object given a textual description of the target. Variability in language
descriptions and spatial relationships of 3D objects makes this a complex task,
increasing the need to better understand the behavior of neural network models
in this domain. However, limited research has been conducted in this area.
Specifically, when a model makes an incorrect prediction despite being provided
with a seemingly correct object description, practitioners are left wondering:
"Why is the model wrong?". In this work, we present a method answering this
question by generating counterfactual examples. Our method takes a
misclassified sample, which includes two objects and a text description, and
generates an alternative yet similar formulation that would have resulted in a
correct prediction by the model. We have evaluated our approach with data from
the ShapeTalk dataset along with three distinct models. Our counterfactual
examples maintain the structure of the original description, are semantically
similar and meaningful. They reveal weaknesses in the description, model bias
and enhance the understanding of the models behavior. Theses insights help
practitioners to better interact with systems as well as engineers to improve
models.

Conclusion: MINT为单模态大模型与多模态领域知识的对齐提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to
effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized
biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal
Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder
models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data
through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization
techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the
aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs
while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an
upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality
multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or
image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications:
(1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal
encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a
preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite
relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained
with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue
type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a
vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing
knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align
downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly
improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type
classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align
unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference
optimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图像修复框架SWFormer，通过多域学习和改进的Transformer结构，在多种修复任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然图像因大气和成像条件导致多种退化现象，现有Transformer方法模型复杂且未充分利用退化共性。

Method: 提出Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier多域结构和多尺度学习，改进Token Mixer和Feed-Forward Network。

Result: 在十种修复任务中超越现有方法，平衡了性能、参数、计算成本和推理延迟。

Conclusion: SWFormer在多域学习和效率方面表现突出，为图像修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to adverse atmospheric and imaging conditions, natural images suffer from
various degradation phenomena. Consequently, image restoration has emerged as a
key solution and garnered substantial attention. Although recent Transformer
architectures have demonstrated impressive success across various restoration
tasks, their considerable model complexity poses significant challenges for
both training and real-time deployment. Furthermore, instead of investigating
the commonalities among different degradations, most existing restoration
methods focus on modifying Transformer under limited restoration priors. In
this work, we first review various degradation phenomena under multi-domain
perspective, identifying common priors. Then, we introduce a novel restoration
framework, which integrates multi-domain learning into Transformer.
Specifically, in Token Mixer, we propose a Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier multi-domain
structure that facilitates local-region-global multi-receptive field modeling
to replace vanilla self-attention. Additionally, in Feed-Forward Network, we
incorporate multi-scale learning to fuse multi-domain features at different
resolutions. Comprehensive experimental results across ten restoration tasks,
such as dehazing, desnowing, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, rain
streak/raindrop removal, cloud removal, shadow removal, underwater enhancement
and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves a favorable trade-off among restoration
performance, parameter size, computational cost and inference latency. The code

*Yi Liu,Xinyi Liu,Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Yi Wan,Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StereoINR提出了一种基于隐式神经表示的立体图像超分辨率方法，突破了固定尺度的限制，并通过跨视图信息融合显著提升了几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立体超分辨率方法缺乏跨视图几何一致性和自适应多尺度能力，限制了性能。

Method: StereoINR将立体图像对建模为连续隐式表示，结合空间扭曲和跨注意力机制实现跨视图信息融合。

Result: 实验表明，StereoINR在训练分布内外尺度均表现优异，几何一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: StereoINR为任意尺度立体超分辨率提供了统一解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Stereo image super-resolution (SSR) aims to enhance high-resolution details
by leveraging information from stereo image pairs. However, existing stereo
super-resolution (SSR) upsampling methods (e.g., pixel shuffle) often overlook
cross-view geometric consistency and are limited to fixed-scale upsampling. The
key issue is that previous upsampling methods use convolution to independently
process deep features of different views, lacking cross-view and non-local
information perception, making it difficult to select beneficial information
from multi-view scenes adaptively. In this work, we propose Stereo Implicit
Neural Representation (StereoINR), which innovatively models stereo image pairs
as continuous implicit representations. This continuous representation breaks
through the scale limitations, providing a unified solution for arbitrary-scale
stereo super-resolution reconstruction of left-right views. Furthermore, by
incorporating spatial warping and cross-attention mechanisms, StereoINR enables
effective cross-view information fusion and achieves significant improvements
in pixel-level geometric consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets show that StereoINR outperforms out-of-training-distribution scale
upsampling and matches state-of-the-art SSR methods within
training-distribution scales.

*Jaeyoung Huh,Ankur Kapoor,Young-Ho Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种AI驱动的跟踪模型，用于在心脏内超声（ICE）成像中持续追踪治疗设备尖端，通过混合数据集和预训练模型提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动ICE导管操作中治疗设备尖端的持续可见性难以保持，需频繁调整，影响手术效率。

Method: 结合临床ICE序列与合成数据增强生成混合数据集，利用预训练超声基础模型和基于Transformer的网络进行特征提取与预测。

Result: 模型实现了3.32度的入射角误差和12.76度的旋转角误差，为实时机器人ICE导管调整奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该AI框架显著减少操作负担并确保设备可见性，未来将扩展临床数据集以进一步提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a critical role in
Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by
providing real-time visualization of intracardiac structures. However,
maintaining continuous visibility of the therapy device tip remains a challenge
due to frequent adjustments required during manual ICE catheter manipulation.
To address this, we propose an AI-driven tracking model that estimates the
device tip incident angle and passing point within the ICE imaging plane,
ensuring continuous visibility and facilitating robotic ICE catheter control.
  A key innovation of our approach is the hybrid dataset generation strategy,
which combines clinical ICE sequences with synthetic data augmentation to
enhance model robustness. We collected ICE images in a water chamber setup,
equipping both the ICE catheter and device tip with electromagnetic (EM)
sensors to establish precise ground-truth locations. Synthetic sequences were
created by overlaying catheter tips onto real ICE images, preserving motion
continuity while simulating diverse anatomical scenarios. The final dataset
consists of 5,698 ICE-tip image pairs, ensuring comprehensive training
coverage.
  Our model architecture integrates a pretrained ultrasound (US) foundation
model, trained on 37.4M echocardiography images, for feature extraction. A
transformer-based network processes sequential ICE frames, leveraging
historical passing points and incident angles to improve prediction accuracy.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 3.32 degree entry
angle error, 12.76 degree rotation angle error. This AI-driven framework lays
the foundation for real-time robotic ICE catheter adjustments, minimizing
operator workload while ensuring consistent therapy device visibility. Future
work will focus on expanding clinical datasets to further enhance model
generalization.

*Jiachen Tu,Yaokun Shi,Fan Lam*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: C2S是一种基于分数的自监督MRI去噪框架，通过广义去噪分数匹配损失直接从噪声数据中学习，无需高信噪比标签，并在多噪声水平和多对比度条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI图像中的噪声会降低图像质量和诊断准确性，而现有自监督去噪方法容易过度平滑细节且性能不如监督方法。

Method: 提出C2S框架，采用广义去噪分数匹配损失（GDSM）直接从噪声数据学习，引入噪声水平重参数化和细节细化扩展。

Result: 在M4Raw和fastMRI数据集上，C2S在自监督方法中表现最佳，与监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: C2S为MRI去噪提供了一种无需高信噪比标签的高效自监督解决方案，适用于多噪声水平和多对比度场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful noninvasive diagnostic imaging
tool that provides unparalleled soft tissue contrast and anatomical detail.
Noise contamination, especially in accelerated and/or low-field acquisitions,
can significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Supervised
learning based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but
require high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable.
Self-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but
existing self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial
features and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods. We
introduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework
for MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching
(GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy
observations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given
further corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn
denoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally,
we incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and
enhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance
noise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S
can be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary
information across different MRI contrasts. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods and
competitive results compared to supervised counterparts across varying noise
conditions and MRI contrasts on the M4Raw and fastMRI dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统2D超声图像解释依赖操作者、现有3D重建方法计算成本高且不符合超声物理特性的问题。

Method: 提出UltraGauss框架，基于高斯泼溅技术，模拟探头平面与3D空间的交互，优化GPU并行化和数值稳定性。

Result: 在真实临床数据上，UltraGauss在5分钟内达到最优重建效果，20分钟内SSIM达0.99，专家评价其重建效果最真实。

Conclusion: UltraGauss为超声图像重建提供了高效、准确的解决方案，未来将通过开源进一步推动领域发展。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used due to its safety, affordability, and
real-time capabilities, but its 2D interpretation is highly operator-dependent,
leading to variability and increased cognitive demand. 2D-to-3D reconstruction
mitigates these challenges by providing standardized volumetric views, yet
existing methods are often computationally expensive, memory-intensive, or
incompatible with ultrasound physics. We introduce UltraGauss: the first
ultrasound-specific Gaussian Splatting framework, extending view synthesis
techniques to ultrasound wave propagation. Unlike conventional
perspective-based splatting, UltraGauss models probe-plane intersections in 3D,
aligning with acoustic image formation. We derive an efficient rasterization
boundary formulation for GPU parallelization and introduce a numerically stable
covariance parametrization, improving computational efficiency and
reconstruction accuracy. On real clinical ultrasound data, UltraGauss achieves
state-of-the-art reconstructions in 5 minutes, and reaching 0.99 SSIM within 20
minutes on a single GPU. A survey of expert clinicians confirms UltraGauss'
reconstructions are the most realistic among competing methods. Our CUDA
implementation will be released upon publication.

Abstract: EfficientNet models are convolutional neural networks optimized for parameter
allocation by jointly balancing network width, depth, and resolution. Renowned
for their exceptional accuracy, these models have become a standard for image
classification tasks across diverse computer vision benchmarks. While
traditional neural networks learn correlations between feature channels during
training, vector-valued neural networks inherently treat multidimensional data
as coherent entities, taking for granted the inter-channel relationships. This
paper introduces vector-valued EfficientNets (V-EfficientNets), a novel
extension of EfficientNet designed to process arbitrary vector-valued data. The
proposed models are evaluated on a medical image classification task, achieving
an average accuracy of 99.46% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset for detecting acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. V-EfficientNets demonstrate remarkable efficiency,
significantly reducing parameters while outperforming state-of-the-art models,
including the original EfficientNet. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有望提高数字病理学中机器学习模型的准确性和一致性，并拓展至其他癌症的诊断和预后。

Abstract: Histopathology evaluation of tissue specimens through microscopic examination
is essential for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, traditional
manual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability,
potentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology
images continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis
to address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial
intelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have
significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing
histopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML
models are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and
reflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively,
particularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful
orientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological
biomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised
segmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA)
images from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The
biomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and
generalizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution
kernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and
robustness of ML models in digital pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to
improve diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of histopathology beyond
prostate cancer through equivariant imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自监督和监督学习的混合学习方法，用于在缺乏高质量参考图像的情况下改进MRI重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习需要高质量参考图像，而自监督学习在高加速率下性能下降，因此提出混合学习以解决这些限制。

Method: 分两阶段：第一阶段用自监督学习从噪声或欠采样数据生成改进图像；第二阶段用监督学习进一步优化重建性能。

Result: 在螺旋UTE肺MRI和3D T1脑成像中，混合学习在图像质量和定量准确性上均优于自监督和监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 混合学习为缺乏高质量参考数据时的MRI重建提供了有效解决方案，有望推动深度学习在临床中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for MRI
reconstruction, but conventional supervised learning methods require
high-quality reference images, which are often unavailable in practice.
Self-supervised learning offers an alternative, yet its performance degrades at
high acceleration rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid
learning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised
and supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.
  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the
first stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images
from noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as
pseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to
refine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We
evaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated
0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of
the brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.
  Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image
quality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across
different acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE. For 3D T1 mapping,
hybrid learning achieved superior T1 quantification accuracy across a wide
dynamic range, outperforming self-supervised learning in all tested conditions.
  Conclusions: Hybrid learning provides a practical and effective solution for
training deep MRI reconstruction networks when only low-quality or incomplete
reference data are available. It enables improved image quality and accurate
quantitative mapping across different applications and field strengths,
representing a promising technique toward broader clinical deployment of deep
learning-based MRI.

Conclusion: 该方法可靠，为3D心脏重建提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Echocardiogram is the most commonly used imaging modality in cardiac
assessment duo to its non-invasive nature, real-time capability, and
cost-effectiveness. Despite its advantages, most clinical echocardiograms
provide only two-dimensional views, limiting the ability to fully assess
cardiac anatomy and function in three dimensions. While three-dimensional
echocardiography exists, it often suffers from reduced resolution, limited
availability, and higher acquisition costs. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a deep learning framework S2MNet that reconstructs continuous and
high-fidelity 3D heart models by integrating six slices of routinely acquired
2D echocardiogram views. Our method has three advantages. First, our method
avoid the difficulties on training data acquasition by simulate six of 2D
echocardiogram images from corresponding slices of a given 3D heart mesh.
Second, we introduce a deformation field-based method, which avoid spatial
discontinuities or structural artifacts in 3D echocardiogram reconstructions.
We validate our method using clinically collected echocardiogram and
demonstrate that our estimated left ventricular volume, a key clinical
indicator of cardiac function, is strongly correlated with the doctor measured
GLPS, a clinical measurement that should demonstrate a negative correlation
with LVE in medical theory. This association confirms the reliability of our
proposed 3D construction method.

Abstract: Automatic lymph node segmentation is the cornerstone for advances in computer
vision tasks for early detection and staging of cancer. Traditional
segmentation methods are constrained by manual delineation and variability in
operator proficiency, limiting their ability to achieve high accuracy. The
introduction of deep learning technologies offers new possibilities for
improving the accuracy of lymph node image analysis. This study evaluates the
application of deep learning in lymph node segmentation and discusses the
methodologies of various deep learning architectures such as convolutional
neural networks, encoder-decoder networks, and transformers in analyzing
medical imaging data across different modalities. Despite the advancements, it
still confronts challenges like the shape diversity of lymph nodes, the
scarcity of accurately labeled datasets, and the inadequate development of
methods that are robust and generalizable across different imaging modalities.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a
comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in lymph

<details>

Motivation: CNN和Transformer在息肉分割中存在局限性：CNN难以建模长距离依赖，Transformer计算复杂度高。Mamba虽有效但无法捕捉拓扑特征，导致边界分割不准确。

Method: 分两阶段：1) 使用VM-UNetV2生成概率图并计算拓扑注意力图；2) 将拓扑注意力图集成到VM-UNetV2的SDI模块中，形成Topo-SDI模块以增强分割结果。

Result: 在五个公开息肉分割数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Topo-VM-UNetV2通过引入拓扑特征显著提升了息肉分割的准确性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer-based architectures are
two dominant deep learning models for polyp segmentation. However, CNNs have
limited capability for modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformers
incur quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models such as
Mamba have been recognized as a promising approach for polyp segmentation
because they not only model long-range interactions effectively but also
maintain linear computational complexity. However, Mamba-based architectures
still struggle to capture topological features (e.g., connected components,
loops, voids), leading to inaccurate boundary delineation and polyp
segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach called
Topo-VM-UNetV2, which encodes topological features into the Mamba-based
state-of-the-art polyp segmentation model, VM-UNetV2. Our method consists of
two stages: Stage 1: VM-UNetV2 is used to generate probability maps (PMs) for
the training and test images, which are then used to compute topology attention
maps. Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams of the PMs, then we
generate persistence score maps by assigning persistence values (i.e., the
difference between death and birth times) of each topological feature to its
birth location, finally we transform persistence scores into attention weights
using the sigmoid function. Stage 2: These topology attention maps are
integrated into the semantics and detail infusion (SDI) module of VM-UNetV2 to
form a topology-guided semantics and detail infusion (Topo-SDI) module for
enhancing the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on five public polyp
segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The
code will be made publicly available.

will change over time. Once a set of trial questions is answered, the system
can initiate the conversation on the disorder under the focus according to the
user's sensibility to that disorder, in an attempt to establish a more
empathetic communication. Then, an open conversation based on the GPT-3
