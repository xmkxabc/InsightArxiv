While video-based gait identification systems\nperform well on large public datasets, their performance drops when applied to\nreal-world, unconstrained gait data due to various factors. Among these,\nuncontrolled outdoor environments, non-overlapping camera views, varying\nillumination, and computational efficiency are core challenges in gait-based\nauthentication. Currently, no dataset addresses all these challenges\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we propose an OptiGait-LGBM model capable of\nrecognizing person re-identification under these constraints using a skeletal\nmodel approach, which helps mitigate inconsistencies in a person's appearance.\nThe model constructs a dataset from landmark positions, minimizing memory usage\nby using non-sequential data. A benchmark dataset, RUET-GAIT, is introduced to\nrepresent uncontrolled gait sequences in complex outdoor environments. The\nprocess involves extracting skeletal joint landmarks, generating numerical\ndatasets, and developing an OptiGait-LGBM gait classification model.

To address these\nissues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state\nestimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six\nintegrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB\nsensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in\nresolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with\nanthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors\nare affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled\nUnscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor\ndata and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF\niteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain\nhuman motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over\nstate of the art in pose accuracy."}

Traditionally, the application of remote sensing to\nbiodiversity research has focused on mapping and monitoring habitats, but with\nincreasing availability of large-scale citizen-science wildlife observation\ndata, recent methods have started to explore predicting multi-species presence\ndirectly from satellite images. This paper presents a new data set for\npredicting butterfly species presence from satellite data in the United\nKingdom. We experimentally optimise a Resnet-based model to predict\nmulti-species presence from 4-band satellite images, and find that this model\nespecially outperforms the mean rate baseline for locations with high species\nbiodiversity.

Neural\nvideo codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on\nany handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn\ncontent-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher\ncompression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential\nnot only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms\nand applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams\nor Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However,\ntheir high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time\napplications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a\nregion-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D\nGaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable\nof real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring\nonly thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions\nin 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the\nencoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by\nusing a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian\ninter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be\nused for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural\nvideo codec space."}

The size of these prediction sets indicates model\nuncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing\nconformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set\nincludes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous\nclasses. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end\nusers, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations\nrather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely\nclasses. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets\nusing expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate\nthree conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models\ntrained for cervical atypia classification.

Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors\nare affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled\nUnscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor\ndata and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF\niteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain\nhuman motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over\nstate of the art in pose accuracy."}

If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely\navailable scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would\nbecome significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on\nplain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy\ntransformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose\nSpec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts\nthese issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention\nEncoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with\nself-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space\nblocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a\nhybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on\nthree public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball\nand 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9%\nrespectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves\ncompetitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a\n4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in\nreconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making\nit suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

Existing solutions struggle with image artifacts and\nsevere subject motion or require slice pre-alignment to achieve satisfying\nreconstruction performance. We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and\naccurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion\ncorruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and\nsuper-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on\nimplicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with\ntask-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either\nsimulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480\nreconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different\ncenters, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion\nand image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction\nquality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time."}
