Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area\nlight illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.\nCrucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be\nexecuted on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is\npartitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance.

First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02533v1", "cate": "cs.SE", "date": "2025-07-03", "updated": "2025-07-03"}

Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth.

In the first stage, a velocity-tracking\npolicy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical\nproprioceptive features.

This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in\nresponse to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the\ncompliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor\ndisturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking\na balance between robustness and compliance.

To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming.

The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging.

Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models\non most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,\nsuggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,\nEBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking\ncapabilities of models.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02092v1", "cate": "cs.LG", "date": "2025-07-02", "updated": "2025-07-02"}

This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and\nglaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing\nTTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.
