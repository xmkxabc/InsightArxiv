Reader\ndiscretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated\nincreasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving\nand medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world\napplications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align\nwith human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing\nwork on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies\nheavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced\nrealism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)\nusing diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,\nspanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in\neveryday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality\nimage-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic\nannotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality\nannotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.\nFor evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \\textit{moral judgment} and\n\\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral\nviolations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses\na significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current\nstate-of-the-art models.

In medical imaging, VG\nenhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features\ncorresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and\ntrustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical\npractice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with\ndisease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of\nfine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate\ntwo key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background\ntokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the\nglobal tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local\ndisease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and\ndisease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective\nDisease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a\nVLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies\ndisease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference.

To combat such issues, we firstly developed an\naugmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which\nsupplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM\nto reduce the negativity of their original sentiment.

We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved\nsuperior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different\nprompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the\nliterature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw\nevidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the\nbest performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training\nlanguage models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered\nan improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same\ndataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)\noutperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for\nLIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to\nreproduce the results."}

However, our\nempirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer\nsevere performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when\ncompressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To\nenable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose\nClapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation\nand introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient\ntemporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method,\nwe achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61\ntokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper\nachieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with\nfewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available\non the homepage."}

However, their\nenhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety\nperformance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important\nresearch question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs\nthrough Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an\nunexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1\nfails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify\nthree key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that\nexplicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can\nlead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and\ncomplex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we\nfind that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain\ncomparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn\nthan more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection\non the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math\nreasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and\nover-refusal.

As a result, the impact of the LLM positional\nbias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by\nrelated works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and\ndistracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that\nsophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM\npositional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling."}

Specifically,\nwe first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient\nreasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on\nthis perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method\n(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target\nlength. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff.

Current reasoning\nmodels, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human\nlanguage, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in\nthe semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and\nupper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration\nof reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling\none token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free\nmethod that emulates human-like \"soft\" reasoning by generating soft, abstract\nconcept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created\nby the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the\ncontinuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer\nrepresentations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,\neach generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related\ndiscrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge\neffectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse\nmathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points\nwhile simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard\nCoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain\nhighly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking\nto break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

Reader\ndiscretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated\nincreasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving\nand medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world\napplications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align\nwith human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing\nwork on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies\nheavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced\nrealism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)\nusing diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,\nspanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in\neveryday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality\nimage-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic\nannotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality\nannotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.\nFor evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \\textit{moral judgment} and\n\\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral\nviolations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses\na significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current\nstate-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE."}

Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator.

Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention\nbecomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically\nwith sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising\ntargets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing\n$c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about\n$1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$.

While refusal responses can be viewed\nas evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research\nsuggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated\nassessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and\ntraining. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used\nto evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking\nand fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess\nrefusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot\nArena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how\ndifferent types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which\nexplicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., \"I can't help with that\nbecause it may be harmful\"), and technical refusals, which reflect system\nlimitations (e.g., \"I can't answer because I lack real-time data\"). We find\nthat LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more\nfavorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.\nWe refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for\nmodel-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.\nThis raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the\nnormative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems."}

Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve\nhuman-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss\nkappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With\nthe high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can\nannotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by\nhuman annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we\nfurther released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2\nhours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice\ncloning."}

The lack of annotated datasets that\ncapture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in\nMandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce\nToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed\nannotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)\nand sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,\nsourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,\nmirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal\ndetection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional\nfeatures using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive\nexperiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models,\nunderscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden\ntoxic expressions."}

While significant\nprogress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical\nframeworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified\nmathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM\narchitectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two\nfundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates\nSolomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length\noptimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff\ninduction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for\nin-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our\ntheoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection\nthat prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We\ndemonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that\nthis strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for\nsmaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence\nexamples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and\npractical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable\ninsights for future model development."}
