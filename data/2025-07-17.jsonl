However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift.

Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science.

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training\nscheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn\nnon-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.\nSpecifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to\nshape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and\noutperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art\nperformance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various\nbaselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective\nmotion planning.", "comment": "Accepted at IROS 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12977v1", "cate": "cs.RO", "date": "2025-07-17", "updated": "2025-07-17"}

Given an input grammar, our\ntechnique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers\nto reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in\nspecifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program\nexecutions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we\nsystematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This\nenables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of\nour approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately\nreproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.", "comment": "Accepted to ICSME 2025", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13117v1", "cate": "cs.SE", "date": "2025-07-17", "updated": "2025-07-17"}

This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with\napplications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological\nmonitoring.", "comment": "This paper is the official challenge report for SMOT4SB and is\n  published in the proceedings of MVA 2025 (19th International Conference on\n  Machine Vision and Applications).

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local\nSynthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but\nsuffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D\nimage generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D\ninpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule\nand the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for\nhigh-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial\ntraining. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet\ndiffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting\nmodel, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a\nPSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these\nscores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81\ns per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue\ninpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior\nperformance metrics.

In this context, this paper addresses the following questions: can\nan MO still continue to control its IRS independently of other MOs and IRSs? Is\njoint optimization of IRSs deployed by different MOs and inter-MO cooperation\nneeded? To that end, by considering the mmWave bands, we first derive the\nergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) in a $2$-MO system for the following\nschemes: 1) joint optimization of an overall phase angle of the IRSs with MO\ncooperation, 2) MO cooperation via time-sharing, and 3) no cooperation between\nthe MOs. We find that even with no cooperation between the MOs, the performance\nof a given MO is not degraded by the presence of an out-of-band (OOB) MO\ndeploying and independently controlling its own IRS. On the other hand, the SE\ngain obtained at a given MO using joint optimization and cooperation over the\nno-cooperation scheme decreases inversely with the number of elements in the\nIRS deployed by the other MO.

Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has\nbeen of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors\npartitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\n  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising.

In our approach, instead, we (i) sort the suffix tree's\nleaves according to a more general priority function $\\pi$ (generalizing suffix\nsorting), (ii) we build a suffix tree path decomposition prioritizing the\nleftmost paths in such an order, and (iii) we path-compress the decomposition's\npaths as pointers to a small subset of the string's suffixes.

A case study\nfrom the Elim\\\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be\nreconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival\nmaterial can be transformed into structured data to support historical and\ndemographic research.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07960v2", "cate": "cs.CV", "date": "2025-06-09", "updated": "2025-07-17"}

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM\nsystems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource\nlanguages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark.

In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation\n(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform\nFGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we\ndesign Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the\npre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that\nare helpful for category prediction.
