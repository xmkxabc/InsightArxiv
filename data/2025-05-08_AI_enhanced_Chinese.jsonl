Reproducing these agile movements\nwith simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of\nmotion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of\nacquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based\nAugmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a\nframework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to\niteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain\ntraversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small\ndataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is\nthen used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these\ngenerated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or\ndiscontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking\ncontroller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then\nadded to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator\nin the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the\ncapabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile\nmodels for interacting with complex environments.

Utilising BERT as the model\nof choice, this study evaluates different binarisation methods for uncertainty\nlabels and explores the efficacy of Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles in\nestimating predictive uncertainty. The results demonstrate good model\nperformance, but also a modest correlation between predictive and linguistic\nuncertainty, highlighting the challenges in aligning machine uncertainty with\nhuman interpretation nuances. Our findings suggest that while Bayesian\napproximations provide valuable uncertainty estimates, further refinement is\nnecessary to fully capture and utilise the subtleties of human uncertainty in\nclinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u7247\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BERT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bDropout\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u673a\u5668\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002"}}

Its key components include: (i) a diagnosis module, which encodes\nhand-drawn signals into 3D point clouds to represent hand-drawn trajectories,\nand (ii) an explanation module, which trains an interpretable surrogate model\nto approximate the local behavior of the black-box diagnostic model.

The model\ndetermines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental\nbeliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert\nand overt modalities.

Despite significant progress in retinal vessel\nsegmentation with the advancement of Neural Networks, there are still\nchallenges to overcome. Specifically, retinal vessel segmentation aims to\npredict the class label for every pixel within a fundus image, with a primary\nfocus on intra-image discrimination, making it vital for models to extract more\ndiscriminative features. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on\nminimizing the difference between the output from the decoder and the label,\nbut ignore fully using feature-level fine-grained representations from the\nencoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attention U-shaped\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network named AttUKAN along with a novel Label-guided\nPixel-wise Contrastive Loss for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we\nimplement Attention Gates into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to enhance model\nsensitivity by suppressing irrelevant feature activations and model\ninterpretability by non-linear modeling of KAN blocks. Additionally, we also\ndesign a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss to supervise our\nproposed AttUKAN to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing\nbetween foreground vessel-pixel pairs and background pairs. Experiments are\nconducted across four public datasets including DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF\nand our private dataset. AttUKAN achieves F1 scores of 82.50%, 81.14%, 81.34%,\n80.21% and 80.09%, along with MIoU scores of 70.24%, 68.64%, 68.59%, 67.21% and\n66.94% in the above datasets, which are the highest compared to 11 networks for\nretinal vessel segmentation.

Recent research has\nexplored using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve LLMs' search capabilities\nby interacting with live search engines in real-world environments. While these\napproaches show promising results, they face two major challenges: (1)\nUncontrolled Document Quality: The quality of documents returned by search\nengines is often unpredictable, introducing noise and instability into the\ntraining process. (2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of\nLLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios.

Existing\napproaches predominantly integrate LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),\nusing GNNs as feature encoders or auxiliary components. However, directly\nencoding graph structures within LLMs has been underexplored, particularly in\nthe context of large-scale graphs where token limitations hinder effective\nrepresentation. To address these challenges, we propose SDM-InstructGLM, a\nnovel instruction-tuned Graph Language Model (InstructGLM) framework that\nenhances scalability and efficiency without relying on GNNs. Our method\nintroduces a similarity-degree-based biased random walk mechanism, which\nselectively samples and encodes graph information based on node-feature\nsimilarity and degree centrality, ensuring an adaptive and structured\nrepresentation within the LLM. This approach significantly improves token\nefficiency, mitigates information loss due to random sampling, and enhances\nperformance on graph-based tasks such as node classification and link\nprediction.

A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg\narchitecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution\n(DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit\n(GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure\nmore accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps\nwith high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision,\n85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to\n93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in\nprecision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model\nperforms pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high\naccuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model\ncomplexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in\ndeep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbYOLOv8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5751\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ca\u5176\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08PothRGBD\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u86c7\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5751\u6d1e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f66\u8f86\u635f\u574f\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e2D RGB\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u6790\u5751\u6d1e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Intel RealSense D415\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u673a\u91c7\u96c6RGB-D\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaPothRGBD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u6539\u8fdbYOLOv8n-seg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u86c7\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\uff08DSConv\uff09\u3001\u7b80\u5355\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08SimAM\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u5355\u5143\uff08GELU\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cmAP@50\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.96%\u30016.13%\u548c2.07%\uff0c\u8fbe\u523093.7%\u300190.4%\u548c93.8%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5751\u6d1e\u5468\u957f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5751\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks often do not\nfully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise\nwhen agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically\nevaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized\nagents.

Still, the impact of model size on the\nperformance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under\nlabel noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of\ntransformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under\nlow-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy\nand calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning\nsettings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large\nwith 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations\n(Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label\nnoise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular)\nconsistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and\ncalibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers\nexhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels.

The method is versatile, predicting any kind of\nroad anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct\nobservation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The\nmethod operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the\nanomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected\npredictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to\npre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an\navoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving.

Building upon the ideas of continuous\nnormalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the\ndiffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data.

This leads to inefficient\nlearning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often\nreside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating\nmanifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often\nrequire expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance.\nTo this end, we present \\texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified\ntraining/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using\npretrained deep latent variable models.

To this end, we propose FarSight, a unified\nend-to-end system for person recognition that integrates complementary\nbiometric cues across face, gait, and body shape modalities.

These components are\ndesigned to work cohesively under degraded image conditions, large pose and\nscale variations, and cross-domain gaps. Extensive experiments on the BRIAR\ndataset, one of the most comprehensive benchmarks for long-range, multi-modal\nbiometric recognition, demonstrate the effectiveness of FarSight.

Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models\nhave advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their\ncapabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal\nunderstanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While\nmany benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we\nsimply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM\ncapability, bringing us closer to human-level AI?

The system supports\nanalysis of both the right and left ventricles as well as myocardium, and then\nclassifies patient's cardiac images into five diagnostic categories: dilated\ncardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right\nventricular abnormality, and no disease. IntelliCardiac combines a deep\nlearning-based segmentation model with a two-step classification pipeline. The\nsegmentation module gains an overall accuracy of 92.6\\%. The classification\nmodule, trained on characteristics taken from segmented heart structures,\nachieves 98\\% accuracy in five categories. These results exceed the performance\nof the existing state-of-the-art methods that integrate both segmentation and\nclassification models. IntelliCardiac, which supports real-time visualization,\nworkflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, has great potential as a\nscalable, accurate tool for clinical decision assistance in cardiac imaging and\ndiagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "IntelliCardiac\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u52724D\u5fc3\u810f\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u810f\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u6b65\u5206\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528ACDC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u51c6\u786e\u738792.6%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u4e94\u7c7b\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98%\u3002", "conclusion": "IntelliCardiac\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u8f85\u52a9\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

By\nassigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future\nlocations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven\napproach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and\nadaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant\nmonitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects\nto be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a\nvalue-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the\ntimely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values\nover time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent\ndeadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves\ncoverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to\ntraditional master-slave camera systems.
