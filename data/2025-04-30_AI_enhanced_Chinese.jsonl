As sports fields have\nrigorous specifications in terms of shape and dimensions of their line, circle\nand point components, sports field markings are commonly used as calibration\ntargets for this task. However, because of the sparse and uneven distribution\nof field markings, close-up camera views around central areas of the field\noften depict only line and circle markings. On these views, sports field\nregistration is challenging for the vast majority of existing methods, as they\nfocus on leveraging line field markings and their intersections. It is indeed a\nchallenge to include circle correspondences in a set of linear equations. In\nthis work, we propose a novel method to derive a set of points and lines from\ncircle correspondences, enabling the exploitation of circle correspondences for\nboth sports field registration and image annotation.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of Fast Gradient Sign Method\n(FGSM) adversarial noise on image classification and investigated whether\ntraining on specific image features can improve robustness. We hypothesize that\nwhile adversarial noise perturbs various regions of an image, edges may remain\nrelatively stable and provide essential structural information for\nclassification. To test this, we conducted a series of experiments using brain\ntumor and COVID datasets. Initially, we trained the models on clean images and\nthen introduced subtle adversarial perturbations, which caused deep learning\nmodels to significantly misclassify the images. Retraining on a combination of\nclean and noisy images led to improved performance. To evaluate the robustness\nof the edge features, we extracted edges from the original/clean images and\ntrained the models exclusively on edge-based representations.

Biometric solutions offer potential for\nchild protection by helping to prevent baby swaps, locate missing children, and\nsupport national identity systems. However, developing effective biometric\nidentification systems for newborns remains a major challenge due to the\nphysiological variability caused by finger growth, weight changes, and skin\ntexture alterations during early development. Current literature has attempted\nto address these issues by applying scaling factors to emulate growth-induced\ndistortions in minutiae maps, but such approaches fail to capture the complex\nand non-linear growth patterns of infants. A key barrier to progress in this\ndomain is the lack of comprehensive, longitudinal biometric datasets capturing\nthe evolution of neonatal fingerprints over time.

With their ability to model\nobject surfaces in a scene as a continuous function, such techniques have made\nremarkable strides recently, especially over classical 3D surface\nreconstruction methods, such as those that use voxels or point clouds. However,\nthese methods struggle with scenes that have varied and complex surfaces\nprincipally because they model any given scene with a single encoder network\nthat is tasked to capture all of low through high-surface frequency information\nin the scene simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel, neural implicit\nsurface representation approach called FreBIS to overcome this challenge.\nFreBIS works by stratifying the scene based on the frequency of surfaces into\nmultiple frequency levels, with each level (or a group of levels) encoded by a\ndedicated encoder. Moreover, FreBIS encourages these encoders to capture\ncomplementary information by promoting mutual dissimilarity of the encoded\nfeatures via a novel, redundancy-aware weighting module. Empirical evaluations\non the challenging BlendedMVS dataset indicate that replacing the standard\nencoder in an off-the-shelf neural surface reconstruction method with our\nfrequency-stratified encoders yields significant improvements.

Despite its practicality, its security analyses have\nfallen far behind. In this paper, we reveal that this mechanism exacerbates the\nrisk of jailbreak attacks. Different from previous attacks that fuse the unsafe\ntarget prompt into one ultimate adversarial prompt, which can be easily\ndetected or may generate non-unsafe images due to under- or over-optimization,\nwe propose Inception, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack against the memory\nmechanism in real-world text-to-image generation systems. Inception embeds the\nmalice at the inception of the chat session turn by turn, leveraging the\nmechanism that T2I generation systems retrieve key information in their memory.\nSpecifically, Inception mainly consists of two modules. It first segments the\nunsafe prompt into chunks, which are subsequently fed to the system in multiple\nturns, serving as pseudo-gradients for directive optimization. Specifically, we\ndevelop a series of segmentation policies that ensure the images generated are\nsemantically consistent with the target prompt.

These mechanisms can be\nbroadly categorized into two types: one that employs explicit horizontal\nshifting, and another that utilizes an implicit cross-attention mechanism to\nreduce cross-view disparity redundancy. In this work, we propose a hybrid\ndisparity compensation (HDC) strategy that leverages explicit pixel\ndisplacement as a robust prior feature to simplify optimization and perform\nimplicit cross-attention mechanisms for subsequent warping operations, thereby\ncapturing a broader range of disparity information. Specifically, HDC first\ncomputes a similarity map by fusing the horizontally shifted cross-view\nfeatures to capture pixel displacement information. This similarity map is then\nnormalized into an \"explicit pixel-wise attention score\" to perform the\ncross-attention mechanism, implicitly aligning features from one view to\nanother. Building upon HDC, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimized neural\nstereo video compression framework, which integrates HDC-based modules into key\ncoding operations, including cross-view feature extraction and reconstruction\n(HDC-FER) and cross-view entropy modeling (HDC-EM).

Results indicate that fine-tuned GPT-4o models\nachieved slightly better performance compared to the performance of ResNet-50,\nachieving up to 98.12% classification accuracy on apple leaf images, compared\nto 96.88% achieved by ResNet-50, with improved generalization and near-zero\ntraining loss.

To address this challenge, we design a simple yet\neffective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further\npropose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker.

Retrieving equivalent\nquestions faces dual challenges: inconsistent representation of theoretical\nconstructs (i.e. concept/sub-concept) across studies as well as between\nquestion and response options, and the evolution of vocabulary and structure in\nlongitudinal text. To address these challenges, our multi-disciplinary\ncollaboration of computer scientists and survey specialists presents a new\ninformation retrieval (IR) task of identifying concept (e.g. Housing, Job,\netc.) equivalence across question and response options to harmonise\nlongitudinal population studies. This paper investigates multiple unsupervised\napproaches on a survey dataset spanning 1946-2020, including probabilistic\nmodels, linear probing of language models, and pre-trained neural networks\nspecialised for IR. We show that IR-specialised neural models achieve the\nhighest overall performance with other approaches performing comparably.\nAdditionally, the re-ranking of the probabilistic model's results with neural\nmodels only introduces modest improvements of 0.07 at most in F1-score.\nQualitative post-hoc evaluation by survey specialists shows that models\ngenerally have a low sensitivity to questions with high lexical overlap,\nparticularly in cases where sub-concepts are mismatched. Altogether, our\nanalysis serves to further research on harmonising longitudinal studies in\nsocial science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u7eb5\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u4e13\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7eb5\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, hallucinations, i.e., the models generating\ncounterfactual responses, remain a challenge. Though recent studies have\nattempted to alleviate object perception hallucinations, they focus on the\nmodels' response generation, and overlooking the task question itself. This\npaper discusses the vulnerability of LVLMs in solving counterfactual\npresupposition questions (CPQs), where the models are prone to accept the\npresuppositions of counterfactual objects and produce severe hallucinatory\nresponses. To this end, we introduce \"Antidote\", a unified, synthetic\ndata-driven post-training framework for mitigating both types of hallucination\nabove. It leverages synthetic data to incorporate factual priors into questions\nto achieve self-correction, and decouple the mitigation process into a\npreference optimization problem. Furthermore, we construct \"CP-Bench\", a novel\nbenchmark to evaluate LVLMs' ability to correctly handle CPQs and produce\nfactual responses. Applied to the LLaVA series, Antidote can simultaneously\nenhance performance on CP-Bench by over 50%, POPE by 1.8-3.3%, and CHAIR & SHR\nby 30-50%, all without relying on external supervision from stronger LVLMs or\nhuman feedback and introducing noticeable catastrophic forgetting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'Antidote'\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u8bbe\u95ee\u9898\uff08CPQs\uff09\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LVLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u8bbe\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165'Antidote'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6784\u5efa'CP-Bench'\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c'Antidote'\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CP-Bench\u6027\u80fd\uff0850%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u3001POPE\uff081.8-3.3%\uff09\u548cCHAIR & SHR\uff0830-50%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "conclusion": "'Antidote'\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86LVLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Previous backdoor detection methods\nprimarily focus on the static features of backdoor samples. However, a vital\nproperty of diffusion models is their inherent dynamism. This study introduces\na novel backdoor detection perspective named Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA),\nshowing that these dynamic characteristics serve as better indicators for\nbackdoor detection. Specifically, by examining the dynamic evolution of\ncross-attention maps, we observe that backdoor samples exhibit distinct feature\nevolution patterns at the $<$EOS$>$ token compared to benign samples. To\nquantify these dynamic anomalies, we first introduce DAA-I, which treats the\ntokens' attention maps as spatially independent and measures dynamic feature\nusing the Frobenius norm. Furthermore, to better capture the interactions\nbetween attention maps and refine the feature, we propose a dynamical\nsystem-based approach, referred to as DAA-S. This model formulates the spatial\ncorrelations among attention maps using a graph-based state equation and we\ntheoretically analyze the global asymptotic stability of this method. Extensive\nexperiments across five representative backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate\nthat our approach significantly surpasses existing detection methods, achieving\nan average F1 Score of 79.49% and an AUC of 87.67%.

Unlike\ntraditional ground-based settings, UAVs capture actions from a wide range of\naltitudes, resulting in considerable appearance discrepancies. We introduce a\nmulti-view formulation tailored to varying UAV altitudes and empirically\nobserve a partial order among views, where recognition accuracy consistently\ndecreases as the altitude increases. This motivates a novel approach that\nexplicitly models the hierarchical structure of UAV views to improve\nrecognition performance across altitudes. To this end, we propose the Partial\nOrder Guided Multi-View Network (POG-MVNet), designed to address drastic view\nvariations by effectively leveraging view-dependent information across\ndifferent altitude levels. The framework comprises three key components: a View\nPartition (VP) module, which uses the head-to-body ratio to group views by\naltitude; an Order-aware Feature Decoupling (OFD) module, which disentangles\naction-relevant and view-specific features under partial order guidance; and an\nAction Partial Order Guide (APOG), which leverages the partial order to\ntransfer informative knowledge from easier views to support learning in more\nchallenging ones. We conduct experiments on Drone-Action, MOD20, and UAV\ndatasets, demonstrating that POG-MVNet significantly outperforms competing\nmethods. For example, POG-MVNet achieves a 4.7% improvement on Drone-Action\ndataset and a 3.5% improvement on UAV dataset compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods ASAT and FAR.

Recent work on reconstructing\nthe 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human\npose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it\nstruggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view\ninconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because\nGaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic\nobjects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body.\nMeanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time\nof these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To\naddress these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the\ndynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while\nensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian\nsplats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then\ntransforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve\nefficient pose transformations.

Despite its importance, no existing method has been\nexplicitly designed for this task. While polygonal building outline extraction\nhas been extensively studied, the unique characteristics of roads, such as\nbranching structures and topological connectivity, pose challenges to these\nmethods. To address this gap, we introduce LDPoly, the first dedicated\nframework for extracting polygonal road outlines from high-resolution aerial\nimages. Our method leverages a novel Dual-Latent Diffusion Model with a\nChannel-Embedded Fusion Module, enabling the model to simultaneously generate\nroad masks and vertex heatmaps. A tailored polygonization method is then\napplied to obtain accurate vectorized road polygons with minimal vertex\nredundancy. We evaluate LDPoly on a new benchmark dataset, Map2ImLas, which\ncontains detailed polygonal annotations for various topographic objects in\nseveral Dutch regions. Our experiments include both in-region and cross-region\nevaluations, with the latter designed to assess the model's generalization\nperformance on unseen regions.

Third, we show that without\nfine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge\nthrough multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated\nthoughts.

This result\nmatches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500:\n73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar\nsubstantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B,\nLlama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and\nPPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or\ngreater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In\naddition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including\ncross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and\nsustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has\nsaturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we\nverify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy\ngradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show\nthe critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with\nan appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training.

The Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) offers a promising approach, as it provides an interactive interface\nbased on visual prompting and edition to refine an initial segmentation. This\nmodel has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined\nclasses, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural\nimages and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition,\nthis model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on\n3D images, such as CT and MRI. Recent adaptations of SAM for medical imaging\nare based on 2D models, thus requiring one prompt per slice to segment 3D\nobjects, making the segmentation process tedious. They also lack important\nfeatures such as editing. To bridge this gap, we propose RadSAM, a novel method\nfor segmenting 3D objects with a 2D model from a single prompt. In practice, we\ntrain a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding\nboxes and points.

However, textual\nprompt tuning often struggles with overfitting to known concepts and may be\noverly reliant on memorized text features, limiting its adaptability to unseen\nconcepts. To address this limitation, we propose Federated Multimodal Visual\nPrompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on comprehensive contextual\ninformation -- image-conditioned features and textual attribute features of a\nclass -- that is multimodal in nature. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer\nmodule that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through\ncross-attention, enabling richer contexual integration. The dynamically\ngenerated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder\nof CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a\nconsistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets spanning three\ngeneralization settings demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance\non in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher\ngeneralizability to unseen classes and domains when compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

A recent tendency is to\ninvestigate pre-trained lightweight models rather than deep neural networks in\nSOD tasks, coping with applications under limited computational resources. In\nthis context, we have investigated lightweight networks using a methodology\nnamed Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM), which assumes that the\nencoder's kernels can be estimated from marker pixels on discriminative regions\nof a few representative images. This work proposes flyweight networks, hundreds\nof times lighter than lightweight models, for SOD by combining a FLIM encoder\nwith an adaptive decoder, whose weights are estimated for each input image by a\ngiven heuristic function. Such FLIM networks are trained from three to four\nrepresentative images only and without backpropagation, making the models\nsuitable for applications under labeled data constraints as well. We study five\nadaptive decoders; two of them are introduced here. Differently from the\nprevious ones that rely on one neuron per pixel with shared weights, the\nheuristic functions of the new adaptive decoders estimate the weights of each\nneuron per pixel.

Experimental results demonstrate that DS_FusionNet\nachieves classification accuracies exceeding 90% using only 10% of the\nPlantDisease and CIFAR-10 datasets, while maintaining 85% accuracy on the\ncomplex PlantWild dataset, exhibiting exceptional generalization capabilities.\nThis research not only provides novel technical insights for fine-grained image\nclassification but also establishes a robust foundation for precise\nidentification and management of agricultural diseases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u53cc\u6d41\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DS_FusionNet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5c\u7269\u751f\u957f\u5b89\u5168\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9884\u9632\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u6210\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u519c\u4e1a\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u4e3b\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efaDS_FusionNet\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728PlantDisease\u548cCIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u752810%\u6570\u636e\u5373\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742PlantWild\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u630185%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u75c5\u5bb3\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Compared to cameras or lidars, millimetre-wave radars have the\nability to `see' through thin walls, vegetation, and adversarial weather\nconditions such as heavy rain, fog, snow, and dust. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel SE(2) odometry approach for spinning frequency-modulated continuous-wave\nradars. Our method performs scan-to-local-map registration of the incoming\nradar data in a direct manner using all the radar intensity information without\nthe need for feature or point cloud extraction. The method performs locally\ncontinuous trajectory estimation and accounts for both motion and Doppler\ndistortion of the radar scans. If the radar possesses a specific frequency\nmodulation pattern that makes radial Doppler velocities observable, an\nadditional Doppler-based constraint is formulated to improve the velocity\nestimate and enable odometry in geometrically feature-deprived scenarios (e.g.,\nfeatureless tunnels). Our method has been validated on over 250km of on-road\ndata sourced from public datasets (Boreas and MulRan) and collected using our\nautomotive platform. With the aid of a gyroscope, it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods and achieves an average relative translation error of\n0.26% on the Boreas leaderboard.

The creation of AI-generated images often involves\nrefining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This\nstudy focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration\nusing AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific\ntarget image by iteratively refining their prompt.

A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image\nsimilarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative\nworkflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments\nof similarity align with these metrics. Consequently, we must first validate\ntheir alignment with human perception before assessing their potential as a\nfeedback mechanism in the iterative prompt refinement process. To address these\nresearch gaps, we present a structured user study evaluating how iterative\nprompt refinement affects the similarity of regenerated images relative to\ntheir targets, while also examining whether ISMs capture the same improvements\nperceived by human observers.

The recent emergence of\nthe segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS\nbut cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due\nto its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational\ncost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust\nrepresentation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot\n3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM\nencoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage\nknowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between\nnatural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight\nencoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to\nupdate the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific\nencoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to\nperform mutual supervision for such two encoders.

Detecting such manipulations is especially\nchallenging under open-world conditions, where spoofing methods encountered\nduring testing may differ from those seen during training. In this work, we\npropose an end-to-end deep learning framework for audio deepfake detection that\noperates directly on raw waveforms. Our model, RawNetLite, is a lightweight\nconvolutional-recurrent architecture designed to capture both spectral and\ntemporal features without handcrafted preprocessing. To enhance robustness, we\nintroduce a training strategy that combines data from multiple domains and\nadopts Focal Loss to emphasize difficult or ambiguous samples. We further\ndemonstrate that incorporating codec-based manipulations and applying\nwaveform-level audio augmentations (e.g., pitch shifting, noise, and time\nstretching) leads to significant generalization improvements under realistic\nacoustic conditions. The proposed model achieves over 99.7% F1 and 0.25% EER on\nin-domain data (FakeOrReal), and up to 83.4% F1 with 16.4% EER on a challenging\nout-of-distribution test set (AVSpoof2021 + CodecFake). These findings\nhighlight the importance of diverse training data, tailored objective functions\nand audio augmentations in building resilient and generalizable audio forgery\ndetectors.
