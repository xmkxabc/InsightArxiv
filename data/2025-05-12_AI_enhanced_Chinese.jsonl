Due to diverse and extensive amounts of\ndata recorded, automated processing is necessary. This report describes methods\nto extract and characterize driver head scans at intersections from data\ncollected from an in-car recording system that logged vehicle speed, GPS\nlocation, scene videos, and cabin videos. Custom tools were developed to mark\nthe intersections, synchronize location and video data, and clip the cabin and\nscene videos for +/-100 meters from the intersection location. A\ncustom-developed head pose detection AI model for wide angle head turns was run\non the cabin videos to estimate the driver head pose, from which head scans >20\ndeg were computed in the horizontal direction. The scene videos were processed\nusing a YOLO object detection model to detect traffic lights, stop signs,\npedestrians, and other vehicles on the road. Turning maneuvers were\nindependently detected using vehicle self-motion patterns. Stop lines on the\nroad surface were detected using changing intensity patterns over time as the\nvehicle moved. The information obtained from processing the scene videos, along\nwith the speed data was used in a rule-based algorithm to infer the\nintersection type, maneuver, and bounds. We processed 190 intersections from 3\nvehicles driven in cities and suburban areas from Massachusetts and California.\nThe automated video processing algorithm correctly detected intersection\nsignage and maneuvers in 100% and 94% of instances, respectively. The median\n[IQR] error in detecting vehicle entry into the intersection was 1.1[0.4-4.9]\nmeters and 0.2[0.1-0.54] seconds.

Most previous research on HTC has focused on\nsupervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC\ncan be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces\nissues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we\npresent Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification\n(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by\nintegrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide\nstructured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves\nrelevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to\nunderstand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on\nthree open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon.

In contrast, although traditional\nprocedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,\nLightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.\nUnfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual\nprocedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In\nthis paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to\ncritique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them\nwith a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate\nthat MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing\noperations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.\nSubsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit\nsequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we\nsynthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits\nand then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize\nreasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by\nconstruction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and\nresolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a\nvariety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and\nidentity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural\nalternatives.

Inspired by\nprevious study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated\nset of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting\nfrom GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process\ndemonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks.\nThus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its\nperformance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks,\ndiscriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation,\nspatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These\ntasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's\noutputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world\nconcepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in\ngeneral-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image\ngeneration, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However,\nsignificant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial\nreasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction.\nFurthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios,\nsuch as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often\nexhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies. These\nfindings suggest that while GPT-4o marks a substantial advancement in unified\nmultimodal generation, there is still a long way to go before it can be\nreliably applied to professional or safety-critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPT-4o\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22GPT-4o\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-4o\u5728\u516d\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "GPT-4o\u5728\u901a\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "GPT-4o\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, most prior work either focuses on\npower grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on\ncostly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each\nobject functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information\nfrom web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions,\nthereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human\nhand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human\nhand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its\naccurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from\ninexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To\nfurther expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the\ninitially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to\ngenerate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train\nthe grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects,\nincluding challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs,\nwhich are underrepresented in existing datasets.

This creates a bottleneck in\nmemory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory\n(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth\nand compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily\noptimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access\npatterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they\nsuffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization.\nIn this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme\ntailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC\nclusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory\nregions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve\nrelevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed\ncentroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without\nfrequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM\nsystem show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces\nattention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a\nKV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and\n45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval.

Existing approaches\nfor preserving privacy rely on deep learning models, differential privacy, or\ncryptography. They lack guarantees for the complete concealment of all\nsensitive objects. Guaranteeing concealment requires post-processing techniques\nand thus is inadequate for real-time video streams. We develop a method for\nprivacy-constrained video streaming, PCVS, that conceals sensitive objects\nwithin real-time video streams. PCVS takes a logical specification constraining\nthe existence of privacy-sensitive objects, e.g., never show faces when a\nperson exists. It uses a detection model to evaluate the existence of these\nobjects in each incoming frame. Then, it blurs out a subset of objects such\nthat the existence of the remaining objects satisfies the specification. We\nthen propose a conformal prediction approach to (i) establish a theoretical\nlower bound on the probability of the existence of these objects in a sequence\nof frames satisfying the specification and (ii) update the bound with the\narrival of each subsequent frame. Quantitative evaluations show that PCVS\nachieves over 95 percent specification satisfaction rate in multiple datasets,\nsignificantly outperforming other methods. The satisfaction rate is\nconsistently above the theoretical bounds across all datasets, indicating that\nthe established bounds hold.

However, the effectiveness of\nsupervised lip segmentation is constrained by the availability of lip contour\nin the training phase. A further challenge with lip segmentation is its\nreliance on image quality , lighting, and skin tone, leading to inaccuracies in\nthe detected boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a sequential\nlip segmentation method that integrates attention UNet and multidimensional\ninput. We unravel the micro-patterns in facial images using local binary\npatterns to build multidimensional inputs. Subsequently, the multidimensional\ninputs are fed into sequential attention UNets, where the lip contour is\nreconstructed. We introduce a mask generation method that uses a few anatomical\nlandmarks and estimates the complete lip contour to improve segmentation\naccuracy. This mask has been utilized in the training phase for lip\nsegmentation. To evaluate the proposed method, we use facial images to segment\nthe upper lips and subsequently assess lip-related facial anomalies in subjects\nwith fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Using the proposed lip segmentation method,\nwe achieved a mean dice score of 84.75%, and a mean pixel accuracy of 99.77% in\nupper lip segmentation. To further evaluate the method, we implemented\nclassifiers to identify those with FAS. Using a generative adversarial network\n(GAN), we reached an accuracy of 98.55% in identifying FAS in one of the study\npopulations.

By representing scenes as a\nmixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for\nefficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture\nfine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional\npoints. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting\nin excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands\n- posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies\nand improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is\ncrucial for escaping saddle points.

First,\nwe explored the geometry of complex words in semantic space. To do so, we\nconducted a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering analysis on\n4,226 Malay prefixed words. Several clusters were observed for complex words\nvaried by their prefix class. Then, we derived five simple measures, and\ninvestigated whether they were significant predictors of lexical decision\nlatencies. Two sets of Linear Discriminant Analyses were run in which the\nprefix of a word is predicted from either word embeddings or shift vectors\n(i.e., a vector subtraction of the base word from the derived word). The\naccuracy with which the model predicts the prefix of a word indicates the\ndegree of transparency of the prefix. Three further measures were obtained by\ncomparing embeddings between each word and all other words containing the same\nprefix (i.e., centroid), between each word and the shift from their base word,\nand between each word and the predicted word of the Functional Representations\nof Affixes in Compositional Semantic Space model.

In this research,\nwe focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW),\nmesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique\nchallenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and\nappearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature\nextent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed\nto improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP\nincorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture\nmulti-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an\nAttention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant\nspatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements\nhelp to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model\nand state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in\nmAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively\nover state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite\ndatasets.

Today, such photoreal avatars are seen\nas a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality,\nand entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex\nnon-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images;\ndue to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss\nof fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts,\nbuilt from an individual facial expression.

Moreover, existing agglomerative\nclustering techniques are constrained by the calculation method of connection\ndistance, leading to unstable clustering results. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces a novel density-based agglomerative clustering method, termed\nkFuse. kFuse comprises four key components: (1) sub-cluster partitioning based\non natural neighbors; (2) determination of boundary connectivity between\nsub-clusters through the computation of adjacent samples and shortest\ndistances; (3) assessment of density similarity between sub-clusters via the\ncalculation of mean density and variance; and (4) establishment of merging\nrules between sub-clusters based on boundary connectivity and density\nsimilarity. kFuse requires the specification of the number of clusters only at\nthe final merging stage. Additionally, by comprehensively considering adjacent\nsamples, distances, and densities among different sub-clusters, kFuse\nsignificantly enhances accuracy during the merging phase, thereby greatly\nimproving its identification capability. Experimental results on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of kFuse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u51dd\u805a\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5kFuse\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u90bb\u5c45\u5212\u5206\u5b50\u7c07\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51dd\u805a\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "kFuse\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u81ea\u7136\u90bb\u5c45\u5212\u5206\u5b50\u7c07\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u5408\u5e76\u89c4\u5219\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660ekFuse\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "kFuse\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u91cf\u90bb\u8fd1\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

When agents become\nadjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on\nthe relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by\nthe winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We\nconducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species\" would\nsurvive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of\nwell-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated\nequilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse\npopulations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as\nterrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically\nspecialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats.

The lack of data on\nnationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a\nleft-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of\norigin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can\ndifferentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the\nnationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the\ndetected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which\nis a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6\nmillion unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into\nfamilies of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training\ndata. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1\nscore of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level\ncategorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to\nassign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data.

This paper proposes a lightweight and fully automated\npipeline for knot detection and pairing based on machine learning techniques.\nIn the detection stage, high-resolution surface images of wooden boards were\ncollected using industrial-grade cameras, and a large-scale dataset was\nmanually annotated and preprocessed. After the transfer learning, the YOLOv8l\nachieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.887. In the pairing stage, detected knots were\nanalyzed and paired based on multidimensional feature extraction. A triplet\nneural network was used to map the features into a latent space, enabling\nclustering algorithms to identify and pair corresponding knots. The triplet\nnetwork with learnable weights achieved a pairing accuracy of 0.85. Further\nanalysis revealed that he distances from the knot's start and end points to the\nbottom of the wooden board, and the longitudinal coordinates play crucial roles\nin achieving high pairing accuracy.

While\nthese methods have shown effective performance, none of them take into account\nthe fact that pixels at the boundary and regions with a low number of class\npixels capture more contextual feature information from other classes, leading\nto misclassification of pixels by unequal contextual feature information. In\nthis paper, we propose a dual feature equalization network based on the hybrid\narchitecture of Swin Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, aiming to\naugment the pixel feature representations by image-level equalization feature\ninformation and class-level equalization feature information. Firstly, the\nimage-level feature equalization module is designed to equalize the contextual\ninformation of pixels within the image. Secondly, we aggregate regions of the\nsame class to equalize the pixel feature representations of the corresponding\nclass by class-level feature equalization module. Finally, the pixel feature\nrepresentations are enhanced by learning weights for image-level equalization\nfeature information and class-level equalization feature information.

Nevertheless, the scarcity of samples in data collection\nand the extensive effort required for manual annotation have significantly\nimpeded the availability of diverse datasets. This limitation has restricted\nthe effectiveness of deep learning-based detection methods, particularly those\nbased on large-scale vision models. To address these challenges, we have\ndeveloped an innovative data generation method capable of producing diverse\ncephalometric X-ray images along with corresponding annotations without human\nintervention. To achieve this, our approach initiates by constructing new\ncephalometric landmark annotations using anatomical priors. Then, we employ a\ndiffusion-based generator to create realistic X-ray images that correspond\nclosely with these annotations. To achieve precise control in producing samples\nwith different attributes, we introduce a novel prompt cephalometric X-ray\nimage dataset. This dataset includes real cephalometric X-ray images and\ndetailed medical text prompts describing the images. By leveraging these\ndetailed prompts, our method improves the generation process to control\ndifferent styles and attributes. Facilitated by the large, diverse generated\ndata, we introduce large-scale vision detection models into the cephalometric\nlandmark detection task to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat training with the generated data substantially enhances the performance.\nCompared to methods without using the generated data, our approach improves the\nSuccess Detection Rate (SDR) by 6.5%, attaining a notable 82.2%.

This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire\nbrain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective\nintegration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a\nholistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of\ndata available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in\ndetecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on\nexternal prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some\nextent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed\na large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for\nbrain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following\nfeatures: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and\nintegrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM\nencoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling\nDecoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features\neven with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3)\nAutomatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks\nautomatically without requiring manual prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBrainSegDMLF\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u8111\u90e8\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u3001\u5c0f\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u90e8\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u5272\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u3001\u5c0f\u75c5\u53d8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "BrainSegDMLF\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08DMIF\uff09\u3001\u9010\u5c42\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u5c0f\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "BrainSegDMLF\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u90e8\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Black"], "title": "DiffLocks: Generating 3D Hair from a Single Image using Diffusion Models", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "Accepted to CVPR 2025", "summary": "We address the task of generating 3D hair geometry from a single image, which\nis challenging due to the diversity of hairstyles and the lack of paired\nimage-to-3D hair data. Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data\nand cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional\nintermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings,\nthat require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These\napproaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are\nlimited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a\nwide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the\nlack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair\ndataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic\nhair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that\ngenerates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a\npretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite\nbeing trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp\ntexture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an\nindividual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without\npost-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide\nstrands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of\ncomplex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like\nafro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time.

However, traditional\nmanual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability,\npotentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology\nimages continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis\nto address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have\nsignificantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing\nhistopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML\nmodels are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and\nreflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively,\nparticularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful\norientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological\nbiomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised\nsegmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA)\nimages from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The\nbiomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and\ngeneralizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution\nkernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and\nrobustness of ML models in digital pathology.

To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid\nlearning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised\nand supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.\n  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the\nfirst stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images\nfrom noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as\npseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to\nrefine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We\nevaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated\n0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of\nthe brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.\n  Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image\nquality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across\ndifferent acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE. For 3D T1 mapping,\nhybrid learning achieved superior T1 quantification accuracy across a wide\ndynamic range, outperforming self-supervised learning in all tested conditions.\n  Conclusions: Hybrid learning provides a practical and effective solution for\ntraining deep MRI reconstruction networks when only low-quality or incomplete\nreference data are available. It enables improved image quality and accurate\nquantitative mapping across different applications and field strengths,\nrepresenting a promising technique toward broader clinical deployment of deep\nlearning-based MRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdbMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u87ba\u65cbUTE\u80baMRI\u548c3D T1\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, CNNs have\nlimited capability for modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformers\nincur quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models such as\nMamba have been recognized as a promising approach for polyp segmentation\nbecause they not only model long-range interactions effectively but also\nmaintain linear computational complexity. However, Mamba-based architectures\nstill struggle to capture topological features (e.g., connected components,\nloops, voids), leading to inaccurate boundary delineation and polyp\nsegmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach called\nTopo-VM-UNetV2, which encodes topological features into the Mamba-based\nstate-of-the-art polyp segmentation model, VM-UNetV2. Our method consists of\ntwo stages: Stage 1: VM-UNetV2 is used to generate probability maps (PMs) for\nthe training and test images, which are then used to compute topology attention\nmaps. Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams of the PMs, then we\ngenerate persistence score maps by assigning persistence values (i.e., the\ndifference between death and birth times) of each topological feature to its\nbirth location, finally we transform persistence scores into attention weights\nusing the sigmoid function. Stage 2: These topology attention maps are\nintegrated into the semantics and detail infusion (SDI) module of VM-UNetV2 to\nform a topology-guided semantics and detail infusion (Topo-SDI) module for\nenhancing the segmentation results.
