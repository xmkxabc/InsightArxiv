In\nour approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are\nreconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis\nfunctions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency,\nphase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary\nwith time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify\nthe contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple\nprobabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the\ndeterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This\nframework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly\ninterpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods\nrelying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the\nincorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both\nglobal structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge\ninformation. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate\nthat our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of\nreconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved\ntraining stability and computational efficiency.

Inspired by this,\nwe propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically\ndesigned for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses\nusing Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in\neach video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal\nconsistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced\nthe requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose\nestimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g.\nDINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering\nenhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian\nsplatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features,\nSmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature\ncorrespondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of\nSmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves\nimpressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and\nDORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

This paper extends 3DGS capabilities\nto inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents\nthat blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D\nGaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging\ncomplementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded\nareas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a\nmethod that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different\ninput views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues.\nWe also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the\nmasked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images\nbased on the learned concept.

Our method achieves strong subject consistency and\nscalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot\nsettings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u4e3b\u9898\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u5236\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6ce8\u5165\u4e3b\u9898\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\u4e22\u5f03\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u5207\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3b\u9898\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Martin Gillis", "Ming Hill", "Paul Hollensen", "Alan Fine", "Thomas Trappenberg"], "title": "Masked strategies for images with small objects", "categories": ["cs.CV", "eess.IV"], "comment": null, "summary": "The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood\ncomponents is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as\nsmall pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning\napproaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual\nnetworks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many\napplications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of\nlearned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable\nperformance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using\nself-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then\napplied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven\nto be effective to obtain representations that captures global context\ninformation. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to\nreconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for\nvarious applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less\nthan the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it\nalmost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the\neffect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to\nobtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights\nto train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and\nglobal contextual information.

Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets,\nzero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative.

To address these issues, we propose a two-stage\nframework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing.

Nevertheless, deep learning\nmethods usually rely on large amounts of labeled data. In medical imaging\nresearch, the acquisition of high-quality labels is both expensive and\ndifficult. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) and self-supervised\nlearning provides a pre-training strategy that utilizes abundant unlabeled\ndata, effectively alleviating the label acquisition challenge while broadening\nthe breadth of data utilization. However, ViT's high computational density and\nsubstantial demand for computing power, coupled with the lack of localization\ncharacteristics of its operations on image patches, limit its efficiency and\napplicability in many application scenarios. In this study, we employ\nnn-MobileNet, a lightweight CNN framework, to implement a BERT-style\nself-supervised learning approach. We pre-train the network on the unlabeled\nretinal fundus images from the UK Biobank to improve downstream application\nperformance. We validate the results of the pre-trained model on Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and various retinal diseases\nidentification. The results show that our approach can significantly improve\nperformance in the downstream tasks.

Typically,\nmodels deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their\ndefault set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and\ndevelopers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new\naction classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should\nbe able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this\nprocess should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive\ntraining data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual\naction recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning.\nWhile existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual\nlearning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to\nextensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET\ndemonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight\nbackbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel\nspatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to\napply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new\nbenchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU\nRGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand\ngesture recognition.

In this work, we present\nthree innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of\nheterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State\nSpace Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses\ncontextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and\ncomprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity.

Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature.\nFirst, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search\ndo so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the\ncontinuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that\noperates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation\nmodel with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the\noriginal and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the\ntoken-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents.\nSecond, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the\nadversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a\nmore challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior\nknowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core\ncontribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We\npresent comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain\ndatasets, focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning\nattack.

In-context learning\n(ICL), widely used in natural language processing, leverages these models by\nproviding task-specific prompts without modifying their parameters. This\nparadigm is increasingly being adapted for computer vision, where models\nreceive an input-output image pair, known as an in-context pair, alongside a\nquery image to illustrate the desired output. However, the success of visual\nICL largely hinges on the quality of these prompts. To address this, we propose\nEnhanced Instruct Me More (E-InMeMo), a novel approach that incorporates\nlearnable perturbations into in-context pairs to optimize prompting. Through\nextensive experiments on standard vision tasks, E-InMeMo demonstrates superior\nperformance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it improves mIoU\nscores by 7.99 for foreground segmentation and by 17.04 for single object\ndetection when compared to the baseline without learnable prompts.

First, clustering\nquality is typically assessed using only the encoder's output layer,\ndisregarding valuable information present in the intermediate layers. Second,\nmost DSC approaches treat representation learning and subspace clustering as\nindependent tasks, limiting their effectiveness. Third, they assume the\navailability of a held-out dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which is often\nimpractical in real-world scenarios. Fourth, learning termination is commonly\nbased on clustering error monitoring, requiring external labels. Finally, their\nperformance often depends on post-processing techniques that rely on labeled\ndata.

Traditional computer vision\ntasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete\nvisual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual\nclues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such\nclues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract\nconcepts, e.g. \"enjoy life\". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by\nmanually designing representative features or building prototypes for each\nclass from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with\nthe large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce\na novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL)\nto address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages\nthe systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent\nrecognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained\nfeatures. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance.

In previous research works, fixed loss weights are\nusually chosen for training optimization, and this setting is not linked to the\nimportance of the steganography task itself and the training process. In this\npaper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for\nbalancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.\nTSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics\ncontrol. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information\nembedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the\nmulti-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its\nlearning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the\nmodel learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to\nsteganalysis. In the second stage, the learning speed of each training task is\nevaluated by calculating the loss drop of the before and after iteration rounds\nto balance the learning of each task.

In this paper, we introduce\nUnsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT\nreasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons\nbetween model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is\ndis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such\npreference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an\nimage, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using\na template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as\ninput. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these\nrankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by\nminimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human\nperception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can\nimprove visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where\ntextual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual\nand visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the\nstrong generalization of UV-CoT.

However, generating videos with spatiotemporal\nconsistencies remains challenging. Current methods typically utilize attention\nmechanisms or modify noise to achieve consistent videos, neglecting global\nspatiotemporal information that could help ensure spatial and temporal\nconsistency during video generation. In this paper, we propose the\nNoiseController, consisting of Multi-Level Noise Decomposition, Multi-Frame\nNoise Collaboration, and Joint Denoising, to enhance spatiotemporal\nconsistencies in video generation. In multi-level noise decomposition, we first\ndecompose initial noises into scene-level foreground/background noises,\ncapturing distinct motion properties to model multi-view foreground/background\nvariations. Furthermore, each scene-level noise is further decomposed into\nindividual-level shared and residual components.

Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nscans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response,\nradiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to\ncategorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical\nfeatures: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive\ndisease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep\nlearning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work\naimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO\ncriteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and\ntested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction\nof input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model\narchitectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The\npipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only\nT1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)\nimages as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96%\nwas achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency\nMaps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast,\nGrad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions\nobserved in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it\neffectively identified the tumor region.

However, its clinical utility is limited by\ntechnical challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, aliasing\nartefacts, and the need for accurate quantitative fidelity. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce RSFR (Reconstruction, Segmentation, Fusion &\nRefinement), a novel framework for cardiac diffusion-weighted image\nreconstruction. RSFR employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, leveraging zero-shot\nsemantic priors via the Segment Anything Model and a robust Vision Mamba-based\nreconstruction backbone. Our framework integrates semantic features effectively\nto mitigate artefacts and enhance fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art\nreconstruction quality and accurate DT parameter estimation under high\nundersampling rates. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of RSFR compared to existing methods, highlighting its\nrobustness, scalability, and potential for clinical translation in quantitative\ncardiac DTI.", "AI": {"tldr": "RSFR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548cVision Mamba\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u6269\u6563\u5f20\u91cf\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u810f\u6269\u6563\u5f20\u91cf\u6210\u50cf\uff08DTI\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u3001\u4f2a\u5f71\u591a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRSFR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Segment Anything\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548cVision Mamba\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3b\u5e72\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRSFR\u5728\u9ad8\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684DT\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "RSFR\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u810fDTI\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
