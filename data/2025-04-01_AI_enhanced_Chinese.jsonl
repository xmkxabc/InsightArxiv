Several methods have been proposed\nin the literature that make use of weak annotations in the form of scribbles.\nHowever, these approaches require large amounts of scribble annotations, and\nare only applied to the segmentation of regular organs, which are often\nunavailable for the disease species that fall in the long-tailed distribution.\nMotivated by the fact that the medical labels have anatomy distribution priors,\nwe propose a scribble-supervised clustering-based framework, called MedCL, to\nlearn the inherent anatomy distribution of medical labels. Our approach\nconsists of two steps: i) Mix the features with intra- and inter-image mix\noperations, and ii) Perform feature clustering and regularize the anatomy\ndistribution at both local and global levels. Combined with a small amount of\nweak supervision, the proposed MedCL is able to segment both regular organs and\nchallenging irregular pathologies. We implement MedCL based on SAM and UNet\nbackbones, and evaluate the performance on three open datasets of regular\nstructure (MSCMRseg), multiple organs (BTCV) and irregular pathology (MyoPS).\nIt is shown that even with less scribble supervision, MedCL substantially\noutperforms the conventional segmentation methods.

We made use of Generalized\nAdditive Mixed Models (GAMs) to model f0 contours as a function of a series of\npredictors, including gender, tonal context, tone pattern, speech rate, word\nposition, bigram probability, speaker and word. In the GAM analysis, word and\nsense emerged as crucial predictors of f0 contours, with effect sizes that\nexceed those of tone pattern. For each word token in our dataset, we then\nobtained a contextualized embedding by applying the GPT-2 large language model\nto the context of that token in the corpus. We show that the pitch contours of\nword tokens can be predicted to a considerable extent from these contextualized\nembeddings, which approximate token-specific meanings in contexts of use.

However, some low-resource\nlanguages have up to tens of millions of speakers globally, making it important\nto improve NLG tools for them. Table-to-Text NLG is an excellent measure of\nmodels' reasoning abilities but is very challenging in the multilingual\nsetting.

To\nfacilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost\nCross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input\nsequences.

Furthermore, we\npropose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce\nfloaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in\nwhole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS\nprimitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process.\nLeveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the\nfeed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire\nscene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric\naccuracy.

Previous methods, such as\nMeshGPT, have explored the generation of ready-to-use 3D objects via mesh\nauto-regressive techniques. While these methods produce visually impressive\nresults, their reliance on token-by-token predictions in the auto-regressive\nprocess leads to several significant limitations. These include extremely slow\ngeneration speeds and an uncontrollable number of mesh faces. In this paper, we\nintroduce MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh\ngeneration, which leverages continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete\ntriangle faces. Specifically, MeshCraft consists of two core components: 1) a\ntransformer-based VAE that encodes raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens\nand decodes them back to the original meshes, and 2) a flow-based diffusion\ntransformer conditioned on the number of faces, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality 3D meshes with a predefined number of faces. By utilizing the\ndiffusion model for the simultaneous generation of the entire mesh topology,\nMeshCraft achieves high-fidelity mesh generation at significantly faster speeds\ncompared to auto-regressive methods. Specifically, MeshCraft can generate an\n800-face mesh in just 3.2 seconds (35$\\times$ faster than existing baselines).\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MeshCraft outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ShapeNet dataset\nand demonstrates superior performance on Objaverse dataset.

This allows the model to\nfocus on essential contextual information without fully processing all tokens.\nUnlike previous methods such as H2O and SnapKV, which perform compression only\nafter processing the entire input, or GemFilter, which selects a fixed portion\nof the initial prompt without considering contextual dependencies,\nPromptDistill dynamically allocates computational resources to the most\nrelevant tokens while maintaining a global awareness of the input. Experiments\nusing our method and baseline approaches with base models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B\nInstruct, Phi 3.5 Mini Instruct, and Qwen2 7B Instruct on benchmarks including\nLongBench, InfBench, and Needle in a Haystack demonstrate that PromptDistill\nsignificantly improves efficiency while having minimal impact on output quality\ncompared to the original models. With a single-stage selection strategy,\nPromptDistill effectively balances performance and efficiency, outperforming\nprior methods like GemFilter, H2O, and SnapKV due to its superior ability to\nretain essential information.

In this work,\nwe present a nearly free-lunch method (named FreeInv) to address the issue more\neffectively and efficiently. In FreeInv, we randomly transform the latent\nrepresentation and keep the transformation the same between the corresponding\ninversion and reconstruction time-step. It is motivated from a statistical\nperspective that an ensemble of DDIM inversion processes for multiple\ntrajectories yields a smaller trajectory mismatch error on expectation.\nMoreover, through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we show that\nFreeInv performs an efficient ensemble of multiple trajectories. FreeInv can be\nfreely integrated into existing inversion-based image and video editing\ntechniques.

These\ncore issues arise from its inherently unstructured design and the absence of\nefficient parallelization. To overcome these challenges simultaneously, we\nintroduce CityGS-X, a scalable architecture built on a novel parallelized\nhybrid hierarchical 3D representation (PH^2-3D). As an early attempt, CityGS-X\nabandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a\nnewly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture\nenables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel\nallocations, significantly improving scalability and performance.

While major strides have been\nmade toward the development of general-purpose, multimodal generative models,\nincluding both text-to-image models and multimodal vision-language models, it\nremains unclear whether these systems are capable of accurately generating and\ninterpreting scenes involving the composition of multiple objects and\nrelations. In this work, we present an evaluation of the compositional visual\nprocessing capabilities in the current generation of text-to-image (DALL-E 3)\nand multimodal vision-language models (GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5,\nQWEN2-VL-72B, and InternVL2.5-38B), and compare the performance of these\nsystems to human participants. The results suggest that these systems display\nsome ability to solve compositional and relational tasks, showing notable\nimprovements over the previous generation of multimodal models, but with\nperformance nevertheless well below the level of human participants,\nparticularly for more complex scenes involving many ($>5$) objects and multiple\nrelations. These results highlight the need for further progress toward\ncompositional understanding of visual scenes.", "AI": {"task": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08DALL-E 3\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4V\u3001GPT-4o\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7531\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Recent 3DGS compression methods mainly concentrate on\ncompressing Scaffold-GS, achieving impressive performance but with an\nadditional voxel structure and a complex encoding and quantization strategy. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS\nthat explores in another way to compress the original 3DGS into a compact\nrepresentation without the voxel structure and complex quantization strategies.\nOur observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes\nwith Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes.\nThus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the\nattributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even\nfor a large-scale scene.

This study\naddresses this gap by integrating traditional and novel language models with\nfine-tuned Whisper models to raise their performance in less commonly studied\nlanguages. Through rigorous fine-tuning and evaluation across multiple\ndatasets, we demonstrate substantial improvements in word error rate,\nparticularly in low-resource scenarios. Our approach not only does take\nadvantage of the extensive data Whisper was pre-trained on, but also\ncomplements its linguistic adaptability by incorporating language models.

This couples learning and generating labels on the target\ndomain, and other recent works also leverage the generated labels to add\nadditional domain alignment losses. We believe this coupling is brittle and\nexcessively constrained: there is no guarantee that a student trained only on\nsource data can generate accurate target domain labels and initiate the\npositive feedback loop, and much better target domain labels can likely be\ngenerated by using a large pretrained network that has been exposed to much\nmore data.

New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that\naims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to\nrecognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have\nstruggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external\nknowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their\nscale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive\nqueries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs,\nwe propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of\nlightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs\nthe $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the\ntraining set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between\nthese pairs.

To investigate this, we introduce the Font\nRecognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising\n15 commonly used fonts.

Traditional bundle-adjustment based methods, such\nas SfM and SLAM, struggle to perform reliably on arbitrary data. Although\nspecialized SfM approaches have been developed for handling dynamic scenes,\nthey either require intrinsics or computationally expensive test-time\noptimization and often fall short in performance. Recently, methods like Dust3r\nhave reformulated the SfM problem in a more data-driven way. While such\ntechniques show promising results, they are still 1) not robust towards dynamic\nobjects and 2) require labeled data for supervised training. As an alternative,\nwe propose AnyCam, a fast transformer model that directly estimates camera\nposes and intrinsics from a dynamic video sequence in feed-forward fashion. Our\nintuition is that such a network can learn strong priors over realistic camera\nposes. To scale up our training, we rely on an uncertainty-based loss\nformulation and pre-trained depth and flow networks instead of motion or\ntrajectory supervision. This allows us to use diverse, unlabelled video\ndatasets obtained mostly from YouTube. Additionally, we ensure that the\npredicted trajectory does not accumulate drift over time through a lightweight\ntrajectory refinement step. We test AnyCam on established datasets, where it\ndelivers accurate camera poses and intrinsics both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Furthermore, even with trajectory refinement, AnyCam is\nsignificantly faster than existing works for SfM in dynamic settings.

EagleVision achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both fine-grained object detection and object\nattribute understanding tasks, highlighting the mutual promotion between\ndetection and understanding capabilities in MLLMs. The code, model, data, and\ndemo will be available at https://github.com/XiangTodayEatsWhat/EagleVision.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bEagleVision\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5c0f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEagleVision\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u5c5e\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u4ee5\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaEVAttrs-95K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cEVBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "EagleVision\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4fc3\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "EagleVision\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these, we\npropose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical\nPose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense\nposes from the original sparse 2D pose.

However, insufficient\noversight in artificial Intelligence generated content (AIGC) can facilitate\nthe spread of malicious content and increase the risk of copyright\ninfringement. Among the diverse range of image generation models, the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) is currently the most widely used, dominating the\nmajority of the Text-to-Image model market. Currently, most attribution methods\nfor LDMs rely on directly embedding watermarks into the generated images or\ntheir intermediate noise, a practice that compromises both the quality and the\nrobustness of the generated content. To address these limitations, we introduce\nTraceMark-LDM, an novel algorithm that integrates watermarking to attribute\ngenerated images while guaranteeing non-destructive performance. Unlike current\nmethods, TraceMark-LDM leverages watermarks as guidance to rearrange random\nvariables sampled from a Gaussian distribution. To mitigate potential\ndeviations caused by inversion errors, the small absolute elements are grouped\nand rearranged.

However, existing VAR paradigms process the\nentire token map at each scale step, leading to the complexity and runtime\nscaling dramatically with image resolution. To address this challenge, we\npropose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution\nscaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from\nthe large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this\nobservation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards\npivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from\nprevious scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces\nthe number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger\nresolutions.

However, despite their\ncapabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an\ninherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and\nevent sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage\nimage-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics. In\nthe first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained\nmotion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to\npredict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world\nphysical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second\nstage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video\ngeneration of a VDM.

We also observe that\npre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy\nakin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional\nlayers can be efficiently replaced by derived ``child\" layers generated from a\nshared ``parent\" convolutional kernel through an adapter.\n  To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we\npropose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA.

While cache-based methods show promise by\nleveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable\nfeature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during\nquerying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations:\nDual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

Our\nframework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal\ntrainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.\nExtensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that\nDiffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on\npreviously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.", "AI": {"task": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FSCIL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "FSCIL\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffusion-FSCIL\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CUB-200\u3001miniImageNet\u548cCIFAR-100\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Diffusion-FSCIL\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

However, the low illumination in underwater environments\ndegrades the imaging quality, which in turn seriously deteriorates the\nperformance of underwater semantic segmentation, particularly for outlining the\nobject region boundaries.

Firstly, we propose the Underwater Image Quality\nAttention (UIQA) module. This module enhances the representation of highquality\nsemantic information in underwater image feature channels through a channel\nself-attention mechanism. In order to address the issue of loss of imaging\ndetails due to the underwater environment, the Multi-scale Aggregation\nAttention(MAA) module is proposed. This module aggregates sets of semantic\nfeatures at different scales by extracting discriminative information from\nhigh-level features,thus compensating for the semantic loss of detail in\nunderwater objects.

To perform the fine-tuning, we used the Air Traffic Control\nCorpus dataset from the Linguistic Data Consortium, which contains\napproximately 70 hours of controller and pilot transmissions near three major\nairports in the US. The objective was to reduce the word error rate to enhance\naccuracy in the transcription of aviation communication. First, starting with\nan initial set of hyperparameters for LoRA (Alpha = 64 and Rank = 32), we\nperformed a grid search. We applied a 5-fold cross-validation to find the best\ncombination of distil-Whisper hyperparameters.

Existing RRSIS methods typically employ\ncoarse-grained unidirectional alignment approaches to obtain multimodal\nfeatures, and they often overlook the critical role of language features as\ncontextual information during the decoding process. Consequently, these methods\nexhibit weak object-level correspondence between visual and language features,\nleading to incomplete or erroneous predicted masks, especially when handling\ncomplex expressions and intricate RS image scenes. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a fine-grained cross-modal alignment and decoding Transformer,\nCADFormer, for RRSIS.

The recent emergence of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing\nhuman-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit\nassumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing\nframeworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information\nasymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions.

Using GPT-4o, we implemented\nsimulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas.

OpenDriveVLA builds upon open-source pre-trained\nlarge Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate reliable driving actions,\nconditioned on 3D environmental perception, ego vehicle states, and driver\ncommands. To bridge the modality gap between driving visual representations and\nlanguage embeddings, we propose a hierarchical vision-language alignment\nprocess, projecting both 2D and 3D structured visual tokens into a unified\nsemantic space.

To\novercome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model\nsize and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to\nquantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a\nparticular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance.\nHowever, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different\nscenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for\nenhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To\nthis end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both\nMamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment\non various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation\npersistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a\nlinear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined\nwith a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$.\nTo ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline\naccording to the clustering sequence.

To this end, we propose\nour DiT4SR, one of the pioneering works to tame the large-scale DiT model for\nReal-ISR. Instead of directly injecting embeddings extracted from\nlow-resolution (LR) images like ControlNet, we integrate the LR embeddings into\nthe original attention mechanism of DiT, allowing for the bidirectional flow of\ninformation between the LR latent and the generated latent. The sufficient\ninteraction of these two streams allows the LR stream to evolve with the\ndiffusion process, producing progressively refined guidance that better aligns\nwith the generated latent at each diffusion step. Additionally, the LR guidance\nis injected into the generated latent via a cross-stream convolution layer,\ncompensating for DiT's limited ability to capture local information. These\nsimple but effective designs endow the DiT model with superior performance in\nReal-ISR, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Specifically,\nAgent4RSs introduces memory mechanisms that enable the agents to autonomously\nlearn and self-evolve from real-world interactions.

The strategy\nmodule is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories\ncannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the\ntriggers can play the best role.

However, human-object interaction (HOI)\noften cannot be precisely generated by current T2V models due to the lack of\nlarge-scale videos with accurate captions for HOI. To address this issue, we\nintroduce HOIGen-1M, the first largescale dataset for HOI Generation,\nconsisting of over one million high-quality videos collected from diverse\nsources. In particular, to guarantee the high quality of videos, we first\ndesign an efficient framework to automatically curate HOI videos using the\npowerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and then the videos are\nfurther cleaned by human annotators. Moreover, to obtain accurate textual\ncaptions for HOI videos, we design a novel video description method based on a\nMixture-of-Multimodal-Experts (MoME) strategy that not only generates\nexpressive captions but also eliminates the hallucination by individual MLLM.\nFurthermore, due to the lack of an evaluation framework for generated HOI\nvideos, we propose two new metrics to assess the quality of generated videos in\na coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments reveal that current T2V models\nstruggle to generate high-quality HOI videos and confirm that our HOIGen-1M\ndataset is instrumental for improving HOI video generation.

The realization of high-speed and\nhigh-precision eye-tracking using frame-based image sensors is constrained by\ntheir limited temporal resolution, which impairs the accurate capture of rapid\nocular dynamics, such as saccades and blinks. Event cameras, inspired by\nbiological vision systems, are capable of perceiving eye movements with\nextremely low power consumption and ultra-high temporal resolution.

In addition, we observe a lack of\nbenchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate\nmetric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of\ngenerative language models can differ significantly based on the language being\nused. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual\nquestion answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs.\nOur benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an\nimage and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance.\nThe grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the\njudge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By\ndefining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small\nopen-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In\naddition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we\nalso experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading\ncriteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

Existing I2V\nmethods, primarily trained on natural video datasets, often struggle to\ngenerate dynamic outputs from static paintings. It remains challenging to\ngenerate motion while maintaining visual consistency with real-world paintings.\nThis results in two distinct failure modes: either static outputs due to\nlimited text-based motion interpretation or distorted dynamics caused by\ninadequate alignment with real-world artistic styles. We leverage the advanced\ntext-image alignment capabilities of pre-trained image models to guide the\nanimation process. Our approach introduces synthetic proxy images through two\nkey innovations: (1) Dual-path score distillation: We employ a dual-path\narchitecture to distill motion priors from both real and synthetic data,\npreserving static details from the original painting while learning dynamic\ncharacteristics from synthetic frames. (2) Hybrid latent fusion: We integrate\nhybrid features extracted from real paintings and synthetic proxy images via\nspherical linear interpolation in the latent space, ensuring smooth transitions\nand enhancing temporal consistency. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach significantly improves semantic alignment with text prompts while\nfaithfully preserving the unique characteristics and integrity of the original\npaintings. Crucially, by achieving enhanced dynamic effects without requiring\nany model training or learnable parameters, our framework enables plug-and-play\nintegration with existing I2V methods, making it an ideal solution for\nanimating real-world paintings.

To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2\nwhich integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global\nimage and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates\nthe pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter\n(MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the\nHierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement\nModule (DRM). Specifically, we first introduce MPAdapter to adapt the SAM2\nencoder for enhanced extraction of local details and global semantics in HRCS\nimages. Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and\nglobal context by aggregating multi-view features within and across\nmulti-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored\nhigh-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained\ndetails resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong\ngeneralization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution\ndatasets.

Thirdly, we find\nthat at the fine-level stage, current methods adjust only the target view's\nkeypoints to subpixel level, while those in the source view remain restricted\nat the coarse level and thus not informative enough, detrimental to keypoint\nlocation-sensitive usages.

Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits\nincreasing performance advantages over existing approaches.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAirCache\u7684\u65b0\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u51fa\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76LVLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7cbe\u82f1\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLVLMs\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4fdd\u755910%\u7684\u89c6\u89c9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u7f13\u5b58\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e29%\u81f366%\u3002", "conclusion": "AirCache\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u7f13\u5b58\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LVLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent models, such\nas GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA, achieve pixel-level grounding but incur significant\ncomputational costs due to processing a large number of visual tokens. Existing\ntoken pruning methods, like FastV and PyramidDrop, fail to preserve the local\nvisual features critical for accurate grounding, leading to substantial\nperformance drops in GCG tasks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nLocal-Aware Token Pruning (ALTP), a simple yet effective framework that\naccelerates GCG models by prioritizing local object information. ALTP\nintroduces two key components: (1) Detail Density Capture (DDC), which uses\nsuperpixel segmentation to retain tokens in object-centric regions, preserving\nfine-grained details, and (2) Dynamic Density Formation (DDF), which\ndynamically allocates tokens based on information density, ensuring higher\nretention in semantically rich areas. Extensive experiments on the GranDf\ndataset demonstrate that ALTP significantly outperforms existing token pruning\nmethods, such as FastV and PyramidDrop, on both GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA models.\nNotably, when applied to GLaMM, ALTP achieves a 90% reduction in visual tokens\nwith a 4.9% improvement in AP50 and a 5.0% improvement in Recall compared to\nPyramidDrop.

In particular, when the teacher's modalities\ninclude the student's, additional complementary information can be exploited to\nimprove knowledge transfer. In supervised image classification, image datasets\ntypically include class labels that represent high-level concepts, suggesting a\nnatural avenue to incorporate textual cues for crossmodal KD. However, these\nlabels rarely capture the deeper semantic structures in real-world visuals and\ncan lead to label leakage if used directly as inputs, ultimately limiting KD\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-teacher crossmodal KD\nframework that integrates CLIP image embeddings with learnable WordNet-relaxed\ntext embeddings under a hierarchical loss.

WSOL only requires low-cost image-class\nannotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier, which is\nimportant in histology image analysis. Standard WSOL methods rely on class\nactivation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial localization maps according\nto a single- or two-step strategy. While both strategies have made significant\nprogress, they still face several limitations with histology images.\nSingle-step methods can easily result in under- or over-activation due to the\nlimited visual ROI saliency in histology images and the limited localization\ncues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous convergence between\nclassification and localization tasks. The two-step approach is sub-optimal\nbecause it is tied to a frozen classifier, limiting the capacity for\nlocalization. Moreover, these methods also struggle when applied to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task approach for\nWSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to address the\nasynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is performed in\nthe pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with classification.\nThis allows learning discriminant features and accurate delineation of\nforeground/background regions to support ROI localization and image\nclassification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective foreground/background\npixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that allows for spatial object\nlocalization. PixelCAM is trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from a\npretrained WSOL model. Both image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained\nsimultaneously using standard gradient descent.

While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources.

Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening.

However, the complex optical environment and the limited\nresources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high\naccuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking\nUnderwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the\nlightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a\nnovel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer\naddition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational\noverhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a\ntechnique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps\nand is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the\ntemporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual\nblocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO\narchitecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature\nextraction capabilities.

While\nexisting methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to\neffectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific\ninformation, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this\nchallenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment\nAnalysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary\noptimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA\nemploys a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and\nlocal modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our\napproach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network\narchitectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full\nmodality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior\nperformance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a\n2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the\nprevious best method.

This enables stress-free testing of autonomy\nalgorithms on aerial robots without the risk of crashing into obstacles. We\nachieve over 100Hz of system update rate. Lastly, we build upon our past\nexperiences of offering hands-on aerial robotics courses and propose a new\nopen-source and open-hardware curriculum based on \\textit{VizFlyt} for the\nfuture. We test our framework on various course projects in real-world HITL\nexperiments and present the results showing the efficacy of such a system and\nits large potential use cases.

For many real-world SR applications, the availability of\nhigh-quality HR training images is not given, sparking interest in LR-only\ntraining methods. The LR-only SISR benchmark mimics this condition by allowing\nonly low-resolution (LR) images for model training. For a 4x super-resolution,\nthis effectively reduces the amount of available training data to 6.25% of the\nHR image pixels, which puts the employment of a data-hungry transformer model\ninto question.

Although textual information\nsuffices for many domains, visually driven categories such as fashion or home\ndecor potentially require detailed visual information related to color, style,\nor design. To address this challenge, we propose LaViC (Large Vision-Language\nConversational Recommendation Framework), a novel approach that integrates\ncompact image representations into dialogue-based recommendation systems. LaViC\nleverages a large vision-language model in a two-stage process: (1) visual\nknowledge self-distillation, which condenses product images from hundreds of\ntokens into a small set of visual tokens in a self-distillation manner,\nsignificantly reducing computational overhead, and (2) recommendation prompt\ntuning, which enables the model to incorporate both dialogue context and\ndistilled visual tokens, providing a unified mechanism for capturing textual\nand visual features. To support rigorous evaluation of visually-aware\nconversational recommendation, we construct a new dataset by aligning Reddit\nconversations with Amazon product listings across multiple visually oriented\ncategories (e.g., fashion, beauty, and home). This dataset covers realistic\nuser queries and product appearances in domains where visual details are\ncrucial. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaViC significantly outperforms\ntext-only conversational recommendation methods and open-source vision-language\nbaselines.

In this\nstudy, we propose an explainable neural radiomic sequence model to identify\nregions of compromised pulmonary ventilation based on four-dimensional computed\ntomography (4DCT). A cohort of 45 lung cancer patients from the VAMPIRE dataset\nwas analyzed. For each patient, lung volumes were segmented from 4DCT, and\nvoxel-wise radiomic features (56-dimensional) were extracted across the\nrespiratory cycle to capture local intensity and texture dynamics, forming\ntemporal radiomic sequences. Ground truth ventilation defects were delineated\nvoxel-wise using Galligas-PET and DTPA-SPECT. To identify compromised regions,\nwe developed a temporal saliency-enhanced explainable long short-term memory\n(LSTM) network trained on the radiomic sequences. Temporal saliency maps were\ngenerated to highlight key features contributing to the model's predictions.\nThe proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving average (range)\nDice similarity coefficients of 0.78 (0.74-0.79) for 25 PET cases and 0.78\n(0.74-0.82) for 20 SPECT cases.

Their zero-shot or\nfew-shot learning capabilities, facilitate generalization to new data or tasks\nwithout extensive fine-tuning. A concept that is particularly advantageous in\nthe medical imaging domain, where large annotated datasets for traditional\ntraining are scarce. In this context, a comprehensive evaluation of foundation\nmodels for polyp segmentation was conducted, assessing both detection and\ndelimitation. For the study, three different colonoscopy datasets have been\nemployed to compare the performance of five different foundation models,\nDINOv2, YOLO-World, GroundingDINO, SAM and MedSAM, against two benchmark\nnetworks, YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN. Results show that the success of foundation\nmodels in polyp characterization is highly dependent on domain specialization.\nFor optimal performance in medical applications, domain-specific models are\nessential, and generic models require fine-tuning to achieve effective results.\nThrough this specialization, foundation models demonstrated superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art detection and segmentation models,\nwith some models even excelling in zero-shot evaluation; outperforming\nfine-tuned models on unseen data.", "AI": {"task": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u606f\u8089\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d80%\u7684\u6f0f\u68c0\u606f\u8089\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e94\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08DINOv2\u3001YOLO-World\u3001GroundingDINO\u3001SAM\u548cMedSAM\uff09\u4e0e\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u7f51\u7edc\uff08YOLOv8\u548cMask R-CNN\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u606f\u8089\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}
