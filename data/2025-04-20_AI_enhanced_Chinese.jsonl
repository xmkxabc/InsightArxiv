Unlike previous methods that struggle with\ncomplex or non-standard topologies, UniRig accurately predicts topologically\nvalid skeleton structures thanks to a new Skeleton Tree Tokenization method\nthat efficiently encodes hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. To\ntrain and evaluate UniRig, we present Rig-XL, a new large-scale dataset of over\n14,000 rigged 3D models spanning a wide range of categories. UniRig\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art academic and commercial methods,\nachieving a 215% improvement in rigging accuracy and a 194% improvement in\nmotion accuracy on challenging datasets. Our method works seamlessly across\ndiverse object categories, from detailed anime characters to complex organic\nand inorganic structures, demonstrating its versatility and robustness.

InstantCharacter demonstrates three fundamental\nadvantages: first, it achieves open-domain personalization across diverse\ncharacter appearances, poses, and styles while maintaining high-fidelity\nresults. Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked\ntransformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character\nfeatures and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion\ntransformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a\nlarge-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset\nis systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired\n(text-image combinations) subsets.

In\ncontrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,\nlimiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address\nthis gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,\nbased on Perlin noise and surface parameterization.

However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent\nappearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive\nneural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering\nperformance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar\nrepresentation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance\nwith details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is\nempowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on\ndifferent positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are\nobtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their\ndistances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during\ninterpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and\na linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative\nto the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of\ncoefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian\ncoefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian\noffset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying\ncoefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly\ndifferent Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn\nhigh-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the\nGaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be\nirregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize\nbetter when animated under novel poses.

Compared to capturing data with LiDAR\nsensors and then performing annotation, it is relatively easier to sample point\nclouds from CAD models. Yet, data sampled from CAD models is regular, and does\nnot suffer from occlusion and missing points, which are very common for LiDAR\ndata, creating a large domain shift. Therefore, it is critical to develop\nmethods that can generalize well across different point cloud domains. %In this\npaper, we focus on the 3D point cloud domain generalization problem. Existing\n3D domain generalization methods employ point-based backbones to extract point\ncloud features. Yet, by analyzing point utilization of point-based methods and\nobserving the geometry of point clouds from different domains, we have found\nthat a large number of point features are discarded by point-based methods\nthrough the max-pooling operation.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method\nfor 3D point cloud domain generalization, which can generalize to unseen\ndomains of point clouds.

The spatial primitive\nprediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and\nenables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially\nreducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive\nprediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive\ncorrelations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy.\nMoreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly\nminimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively\neliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall\ncompactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate\nscene modeling.

Despite their practical applications and\nexceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious\ninput exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended\nbehavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as\nadversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is\nchallenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,\nwhich results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we\npropose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models\n(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,\nexplainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research\nsuggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding\nand explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the\nsemantic meaning of text embeddings.

In the first stage,\nwe leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic\nsegmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from\nconventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a\nfused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for\nOR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38\nsimulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results\nindicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves\nperformance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on\ndetecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow\nanalysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions\nand they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating\ndomain-specific appearance differences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\uff08DT\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbRGB\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\uff08OR\uff09\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210OR\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\uff08DT\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528SafeOR\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53cc\u6d41\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u572838\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u624b\u672f\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbRGB\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\uff08DT\uff09\u652f\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684OR\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5916\u89c2\u5dee\u5f02\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

SSL uses a teacher-student paradigm where teacher generates\nhigh-confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to guide student. However, in the\ncontext of 3D-RES, where each label corresponds to a single mask and labeled\ndata is scarce, existing SSL methods treat high-quality pseudo-labels merely as\nauxiliary supervision, which limits the model's learning potential. The\nreliance on high-confidence thresholds for filtering often results in\npotentially valuable pseudo-labels being discarded, restricting the model's\nability to leverage the abundant unlabeled data.

Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to\ncompromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To\nobtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is\ndomain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted\nimages. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the\ndomain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,\nthe positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed\nLayout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder\n(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG\nframework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and\npredicates.

This task involves identifying\nemotion spans, cause spans, and their associated emotion categories within the\ntext to form structured triplets. While prior research has predominantly\nconcentrated on clause-level emotion-cause pair extraction and span-level\nemotion-cause detection, these methods often confront challenges originating\nfrom redundant information retrieval and difficulty in accurately determining\nemotion categories, particularly when emotions are expressed implicitly or\nambiguously.

While foundation models like Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in\nthe task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing\nadapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building\ndistribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge\nextraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection,\ntypically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises.\nThis affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection\naccuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new\nSAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and\nEdge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection.

While CLIP demonstrates\nremarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature\nspaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text\nfeature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing\nworks attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or\nfine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or\ndegradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a\npost-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and\nfine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training\non small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To\nthis end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and\nhybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features\nto follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random\nreference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid\nsoft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and\noutputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both\nmaintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.\nOur extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show\nthat CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the\nzero-shot performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP-Refine\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u5bfc\u81f4\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLIP-Refine\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08RaFA\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u84b8\u998f\uff08HyCD\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c1\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLIP-Refine\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP-Refine\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u5584CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global\nwatermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for\napplications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local\nwatermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions,\nenabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder-\nDistortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking\nmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark\nextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,\nallowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A\nlocalization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark\nregions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and\nimproving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask\ninto the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in\ndesignated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark\nextraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and\nmulti-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the\nrecent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual\nquality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the\ndistortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a\nfew steps of fine-tuning.

While such capabilities empower various creative\napplications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can\nexploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these\nthreats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial\nperturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization\nmodels. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image\nnature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying\nperturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This\nneglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger\nprivacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on\nprivacy protection against personalization. Specifically, we introduce\nCross-image Anti-Personalization (CAP), a novel framework that enhances\nresistance to personalization by enforcing style consistency across perturbed\nimages.

Existing\napproaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate\npipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly\nDetection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating\nlogical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny\nmultimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a\ntwo-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for\nfine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent,\nhuman-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the\ndetection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the\nneed for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the\nMVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller,\nmatches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further\nexcels in producing concise and interpretable rationales.

This\nposition paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that\nthe most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided\nto training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study\n64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay\npeople to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly\nconservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training\ndatasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models\nthemselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.\nIn the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack\nof compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions\nthat could enable fairer practices in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7acb\u573a\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6700\u6602\u8d35\u90e8\u5206\u5e94\u662f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u7684\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a762016\u81f32024\u5e74\u95f4\u53d1\u5e03\u768464\u4e2aLLM\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u5176\u6570\u636e\u751f\u4ea7\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u52b3\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e14\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u516c\u5e73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a7664\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u751f\u4ea7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u8d44\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u768410-1000\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u8d22\u52a1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u8865\u507f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on\ndownstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM\nrepresentations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some\nconcepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause\nthese representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data\nfrequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find\nevidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to\npretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact\ntriplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning\naccuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.\nThis is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we\ndiscover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms\nwhen the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k\ntimes, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during\npretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear\nrepresentation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term\nwas seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a\ndifferent model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method\nfor estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data\nmodels. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains\nsignal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for\ncontrolling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the\nmodels' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While\nconcept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based\napproaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting\nsampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods\nrely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is\nbuilt on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free\nguidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content\nmodification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This\ninspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the\nearly-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image\nmanifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection.

These methods\noften encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of\nphotorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines\ngeometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for\ntransparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on\ngeometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.\nIn the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular\nmodeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric\naccuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth\nextraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending\nweights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust\nweighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task\nunder realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex\ntransparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that\nTSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of\ntransparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.\nSpecifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a\n37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score\ncompared to the top baseline.

Previous GAN inversion-based methods\nusually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the\nrealistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard\nconstraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the\nsame, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus\ndegrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often\nconsider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues\nin images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN\ninversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill\ncontains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN\ngenerator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to\nenhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge\ntexture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a\npre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To\nmitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we\nintroduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and\nimage inpainting.

Recently, transformer and\nstate space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud\nlearning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds,\nwhich have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper\npresents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point\ncloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels\nthrough the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of\nk-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural\ninformation. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce\ncoordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization\nof irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short\nneighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM\nblocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate\nthe proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named\nMedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation.

Project page:\n  https://dachunkai.github.io/evtexture.github.io/", "summary": "In this paper, we tackle the task of blurry video super-resolution (BVSR),\naiming to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from low-resolution (LR) and\nblurry inputs. Current BVSR methods often fail to restore sharp details at high\nresolutions, resulting in noticeable artifacts and jitter due to insufficient\nmotion information for deconvolution and the lack of high-frequency details in\nLR frames. To address these challenges, we introduce event signals into BVSR\nand propose a novel event-enhanced network, Ev-DeblurVSR. To effectively fuse\ninformation from frames and events for feature deblurring, we introduce a\nreciprocal feature deblurring module that leverages motion information from\nintra-frame events to deblur frame features while reciprocally using global\nscene context from the frames to enhance event features. Furthermore, to\nenhance temporal consistency, we propose a hybrid deformable alignment module\nthat fully exploits the complementary motion information from inter-frame\nevents and optical flow to improve motion estimation in the deformable\nalignment process.

As the negative\nbehavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals,\nindustry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in\nLMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have\nbeen overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to\nindividual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but\ncrucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN\nestimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members\nof marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to\ndevelop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our\nunderstanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource\nlanguages and dialects.\n  In this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating\noffensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt,\nthe remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of\nbias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we\nmeasure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus\nModern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against\nmany marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups.

For the critique generation\npart, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with\na broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first\nwrite a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a\nstep-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared\nwith those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many\ncases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results\nsuggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style\nbut also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the\nsecond part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving\ninterpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of\nart. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,\nsocially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that\ntheir performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that\ninvolved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer\ndifferences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to\ncomplex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations\nand potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called\nGenerative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output\nwithout genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are\ninstructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin\nto show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might\nassume.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u827a\u672f\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u827a\u672f\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff0cToM\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u5185\u5bb9\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u590d\u6742ToM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u827a\u672f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u5fc3\u667a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u7ed3\u5408\u827a\u672f\u6279\u8bc4\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u827a\u672f\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u65b0ToM\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd541\u4e2aLLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1bToM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u5883\u4efb\u52a1\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

As such, amateur\nusers can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's\nwork and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright\ninfringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually\nimperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles\n(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in\nthe artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model\nhas been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model\nretraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.\n  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the\ntext-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to\nidentify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of\nspecific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,\nArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style\nrepresentations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,\nArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.\nThe experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that\nArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying\nArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights\ninto the practical implementation.

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for\nmultilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes\nbeyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop\ninference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,\nMLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to\narbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large\nlanguage model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource\nlanguages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple\nfacts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual\nsettings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context\nlength. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate\nthis to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We\nopen-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and\ntraining of multilingual LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLRBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u805a\u5408\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MLRBench\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u805a\u5408\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u523030%\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MLRBench\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A custom dataset was developed featuring\nboth single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded\ngreenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world\nconditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and\ndeformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively\nidentifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12\nleveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing\nit for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the\nhighest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection,\nproving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes.\nAlthough YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR\nconsistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class\ndetection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to\ndifferentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored\nhighest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed\nocclusion contexts.

However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents three key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text\npairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support\nin the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1\non a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation\nbenchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and\nknowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eedDPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u572835\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c116.2%\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57dfFID\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6Hunyuan-Recap100M\u3002"}}

To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to\nvideo pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts\nwithout manual annotation.

Our\nbenchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly\nunderperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the\nperformance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased\ninstructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key\nelements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;\n3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed\nin a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple\nmetrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for\nboth direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe\na ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model\ntraining, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly\nsynthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon\nthat intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Complex-Edit\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6307\u4ee4\u4f1a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6076\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800cBest-of-N\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GPT-4o\u81ea\u52a8\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u201cChain-of-Edit\u201d\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165VLM\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0cBest-of-N\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "Complex-Edit\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5982\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for\nexisting RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match\nscore). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our\nanalysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing\nthe level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5MADAM-RAG\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6RAMDocs\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5f80\u5f80\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAMDocs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1MADAM-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u51b2\u7a81\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "MADAM-RAG\u5728AmbigDocs\u548cFaithEval\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534711.40%\u548c15.80%\uff0c\u4f46RAMDocs\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0832.60\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MADAM-RAG\u521d\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u51b2\u7a81\u56e0\u7d20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Using official SDG texts,\nElsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020-2023), a pilot\non 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models,\nand retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis\nreveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage\nof Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new\ncentral nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal\nclarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity,\nresilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework\noffers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future\nmultimodal and cross-system SDG applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790SDG\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77402030\u5e74\u4e34\u8fd1\uff0cSDG\u8fdb\u5c55\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AI\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDG\u6587\u672c\u3001Elsevier\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cTED\u6f14\u8bb2\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u5e94\u7528AI\u63a8\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u76ee\u680710\u4e0e16\u5173\u8054\u5f3a\uff0c\u76ee\u68076\u8986\u76d6\u5c11\uff1b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8282\u70b9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa6\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u63a8\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edfSDG\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively\ncomplete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs\nand an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are\nbridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze\nuser queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT\nspecialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide\nactionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited\nto categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological\nexistential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query\nprocessing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as\nmetaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves\nformalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's\nFundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of\nbeings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way\nfor a universal query analysis tool.

This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow\nwhile ensuring transparency.

Specifically, RoboTwin creates\nvaried digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and\ninteractive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code\ngeneration framework that combines object annotations with large language\nmodels to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise\nrobotic movement code.

Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic\nVerification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination.\nAdditionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to\nsimultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks\nwithin generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval\nmethods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark\ndatasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image\nretrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemCORE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemCORE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff08SID\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08GSV\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemCORE\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7684Recall@1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.65\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCORE\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,\nand lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and\ndisease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand\ncardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an\nindividual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly\nexploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have\nbegun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data\nand focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a\ncomprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a\ncomprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of\nindividual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,\nViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling\na complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with\ndetailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This\nmulti-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including\ncardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and\nclassification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified\nframework.

While prior research combining visual and tactile\n(visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle\nwith generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In\nthis paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation\nframework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone\nand performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on\nphysical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.\nSpecifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,\nwhere tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates\nrepulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world\nrobot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual\nbackbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and\nbimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some\ndrastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose.
