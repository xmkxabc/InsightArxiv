While prior research has primarily examined demographic\nand cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent\nhistorical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict\ndifferent historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis\ndataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting\nuniversal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate\ngenerated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic\nAssociations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;\n(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts\nin pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated\nracial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our\nfindings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated\nimagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating\nunstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible\ndemographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for\nassessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an\ninitial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned\nTTI models."}

In an experiment involving 22 leading LLMs, each model was\nsystematically given one job description along with a pair of\nprofession-matched CVs, one bearing a male first name, the other a female first\nname, and asked to select the more suitable candidate for the job. Each CV pair\nwas presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences\nin candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical\nprofessional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored\nfemale-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit\ngender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for\nfemale applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral\nidentifiers \"Candidate A\" and \"Candidate B\", several models displayed a\npreference to select \"Candidate A\". Counterbalancing gender assignment between\nthese gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate\nselection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs\nassigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect\nsize was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a\ncandidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected\nregardless of gender. Finally, most models exhibited a substantial positional\nbias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. These findings\nunderscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous\ndecision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply\nprincipled reasoning."}

However, the\nprojector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence\nthe mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In\nthis work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision\nembeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector\nsignificantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while\npreserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual\ncontent. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each\nvision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a\n*multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the\nprojector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a\nlimited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue,\nwe propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level\nalignment.

Given a\nnumber of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average\ninference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features\nduring decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time\nis difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows\nrequest execution preemption across different queues.

We\nintroduce CaseReportBench, an expert-annotated dataset for dense information\nextraction of case reports, focusing on IEMs. Using this dataset, we assess\nvarious models and prompting strategies, introducing novel approaches such as\ncategory-specific prompting and subheading-filtered data integration. Zero-shot\nchain-of-thought prompting offers little advantage over standard zero-shot\nprompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment with the benchmark.\nThe open-source model Qwen2.5-7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our\nclinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details\nfrom case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management. We also\nhighlight areas for improvement, such as LLMs' limitations in recognizing\nnegative findings important for differential diagnosis. This work advances\nLLM-driven clinical natural language processing and paves the way for scalable\nmedical AI applications."}

However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the\nglobal correlations and local smoothness of the background components in\nhyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial\ndomains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To\nmitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named\nHAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)\nfactors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first\ndecomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then\nemployed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background\ncomponent. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex\nregularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to\nsimultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR\nfactors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables\nthe interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and\nsmoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we\ndesign a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group\nsparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex\nmodel, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental\nresults on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection\naccuracy."}

In contrast, recent generative\ntext-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting\ninherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion\nclassifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative\ntasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative\ncompositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number\nof benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the\nmodels succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the\ndiscriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of\ncompositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD\n1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks.\nFurther, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in\nrespective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new\ndiagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models\nthemselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and\nuncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity,\nparticularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand\ncompositionality, but conditions apply! Code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/eugene6923/Diffusion-Classifiers-Compositionality."}

Despite their significance, these\nstudies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation\nfor achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a\nfundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often\npresume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during\nthe alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the\nlearned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading\nmodels to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when\nconfronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly\nintroducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its\nsignals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity\nand allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize\nthat, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess\nthe safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each\nnecessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial\nattacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems."}

In this\neffort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the\neffectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to\nsupport educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading\nassessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant\nchallenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's\nvoices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to\nadvance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset\ncomposed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon\nrequest and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade\nReading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and\ncost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an\nindependent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The\nresults indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly\ninfluenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is\nfundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection.

Not only is\nthis helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach\nalso offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully\ncapable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this\nceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data\ncontamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data\ncontamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training\nmethodologies."}

In this work, we challenge the\nprevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose\nNegative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to\nreflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers.\nIn online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers,\nNFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy\nis parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive\ndata, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct\nexperiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks.

Existing works\nhave been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to\noffer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model\n(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can\nover-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories.

To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,\nwe further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)\nself-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign\nprogress labels accordingly.

However, RLHF often\nsuffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the\nreward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the\nidiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is\niterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated\nhuman feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,\nthe dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in\niterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model\ntraining data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used\nfor optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while\nreinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation\nflexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early\noveroptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more\nstable and generalisable RLHF pipelines."}
