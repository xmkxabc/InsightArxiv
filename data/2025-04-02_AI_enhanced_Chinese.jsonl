Unfortunately,\nexisting approaches struggle with the motion-dependent appearance of keypoints\nand the complex noise prevalent in event streams, resulting in severely limited\nfeature matching capabilities and poor performance on downstream tasks. To\nmitigate this problem, we propose SuperEvent, a data-driven approach to predict\nstable keypoints with expressive descriptors. Due to the absence of event\ndatasets with ground truth keypoint labels, we leverage existing frame-based\nkeypoint detectors on readily available event-aligned and synchronized\ngray-scale frames for self-supervision: we generate temporally sparse keypoint\npseudo-labels considering that events are a product of both scene appearance\nand camera motion.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dynamic\nlabel assignment strategy that allows predictions to have temporal offsets from\nground-truth action times during training, ensuring consistent event spotting.\nOur method extends the concept of minimum-cost matching, which is utilized in\nthe spatial domain for object detection, to the temporal domain.

The pipeline was applied to detect acute\nmyocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes, and hypertension. The performance was\ncompared against clinician-validated diagnoses as the reference standard and\nwidely adopted International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes-based\nmethods. Results: The study cohort accounted for 3,088 patients and 551,095\nclinical notes. The prevalence was 55.4%, 27.7%, 65.9% and for AMI, diabetes,\nand hypertension, respectively. The performance of the LLM-based pipeline for\ndetecting conditions varied: AMI had 88% sensitivity, 63% specificity, and 77%\npositive predictive value (PPV); diabetes had 91% sensitivity, 86% specificity,\nand 71% PPV; and hypertension had 94% sensitivity, 32% specificity, and 72%\nPPV. Compared with ICD codes, the LLM-based method demonstrated improved\nsensitivity and negative predictive value across all conditions. The monthly\npercentage trends from the detected cases by LLM and reference standard showed\nconsistent patterns.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u75be\u75c5\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u75be\u75c5\u7ed3\u679c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u63a5\u5fc3\u810f\u6ce8\u518c\u961f\u5217\u4e0eEHR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5357\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6025\u6027\u5fc3\u808c\u6897\u6b7b\uff08AMI\uff09\u3001\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u548c\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4bAMI\u3001\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u548c\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u654f\u611f\u602788%-94%\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4ICD\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer a potential solution for automating conversational medical\nhistory-taking and improving diagnostic accuracy. This study evaluates the\nfeasibility and performance of LLMs in those tasks for infertility cases. An\nAI-driven conversational system was developed to simulate physician-patient\ninteractions with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4o-mini. A total of 70 real-world\ninfertility cases were processed, generating 420 diagnostic histories.

ChatGPT-4o-mini outperformed\nChatGPT-4o in information extraction accuracy (F1 score: 0.9258 vs. 0.9029, p =\n0.045, d = 0.244) and demonstrated higher completeness in medical\nhistory-taking (97.58% vs. 77.11%), suggesting that ChatGPT-4o-mini is more\neffective in extracting detailed patient information, which is critical for\nimproving diagnostic accuracy.

The importance of the contextualization step differs between\ntasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples.\nOverall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the\nmechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.", "AI": {"task": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8ICL\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790Gemma-2 2B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136ICL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316-\u805a\u5408\u201d\u4e24\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f4e\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u9ad8\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dICL\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce SmartScan, an AI framework\nthat automates data extraction for optimal sensor placement. SmartScan\nidentifies subspaces of interest from satellite images using an interactive\ntool to create facility-specific constraint sets efficiently. SmartScan\nleverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a prompt-based transformer for\nzero-shot segmentation, enabling subspace extraction without explicit training.\nIt operates in two modes: (1) Data Curation Mode, where satellite images are\nprocessed to extract high-quality subspaces using an interactive prompting\nsystem for SAM, and (2) Autonomous Mode, where user-curated prompts train a\ndeep learning network to replace manual prompting, fully automating subspace\nextraction. The interactive tool also serves for quality control, allowing\nusers to refine AI-generated outputs and generate additional constraint sets as\nneeded. With its AI-driven prompting mechanism, SmartScan delivers\nhigh-throughput, high-quality subspace extraction with minimal human\nintervention, enhancing scalability and efficiency.

However, conventional RAG methods often retrieve\ndocuments based solely on surface-level relevance, leading to many issues: they\nmay overlook deeply buried information within individual documents, miss\nrelevant insights spanning multiple sources, and are not well-suited for tasks\nbeyond traditional question answering. In this paper, we propose Insight-RAG, a\nnovel framework designed to address these issues. In the initial stage of\nInsight-RAG, instead of using traditional retrieval methods, we employ an LLM\nto analyze the input query and task, extracting the underlying informational\nrequirements. In the subsequent stage, a specialized LLM -- trained on the\ndocument database -- is queried to mine content that directly addresses these\nidentified insights. Finally, by integrating the original query with the\nretrieved insights, similar to conventional RAG approaches, we employ a final\nLLM to generate a contextually enriched and accurate response. Using two\nscientific paper datasets, we created evaluation benchmarks targeting each of\nthe mentioned issues and assessed Insight-RAG against traditional RAG pipeline.\nOur results demonstrate that the Insight-RAG pipeline successfully addresses\nthese challenges, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin in\nmost cases.

To address this, we propose a novel Marker-based Prompt learning\nframework (MPDrive), which represents spatial coordinates by concise visual\nmarkers, ensuring linguistic expressive consistency and enhancing the accuracy\nof both visual perception and spatial expression in AD-VQA. Specifically, we\ncreate marker images by employing a detection expert to overlay object regions\nwith numerical labels, converting complex textual coordinate generation into\nstraightforward text-based visual marker predictions. Moreover, we fuse\noriginal and marker images as scene-level features and integrate them with\ndetection priors to derive instance-level features. By combining these\nfeatures, we construct dual-granularity visual prompts that stimulate the LLM's\nspatial perception capabilities. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and\nCODA-LM datasets show that MPDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nparticularly in cases requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08MPDrive\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08AD-VQA\uff09\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5750\u6807\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f20\u9012\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8868\u8fbe\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPDrive\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728DriveLM\u548cCODA-LM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMPDrive\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MPDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AD-VQA\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This study evaluates spontaneous\ndeception produced by LLMs in a preregistered experimental protocol using tools\nfrom signaling theory. A range of proprietary closed-source and open-source\nLLMs are evaluated using modified 2x2 games (in the style of Prisoner's\nDilemma) augmented with a phase in which they can freely communicate to the\nother agent using unconstrained language. This setup creates an opportunity to\ndeceive, in conditions that vary in how useful deception might be to an agent's\nrational self-interest. The results indicate that 1) all tested LLMs\nspontaneously misrepresent their actions in at least some conditions, 2) they\nare generally more likely to do so in situations in which deception would\nbenefit them, and 3) models exhibiting better reasoning capacity overall tend\nto deceive at higher rates. Taken together, these results suggest a tradeoff\nbetween LLM reasoning capability and honesty. They also provide evidence of\nreasoning-like behavior in LLMs from a novel experimental configuration.\nFinally, they reveal certain contextual factors that affect whether LLMs will\ndeceive or not.

Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from\nobstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow\nfor unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven\nscene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a\nmoving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle\nwith visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying\ncamera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by\nforeground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D\nscene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U.\nSpecifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a\nlarge language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then,\nwe employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded\nregions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical\nrepresentation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a\n3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which\nultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural\nconsistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms\nstate-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE,\nwhile also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate\nthe robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from\nvarious landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction,\nwhich contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites.

However, zero-shot\nprompting always encounters low performance, and the superior performance of\nfew-shot prompting hinges on the manual-crafted demonstrations. In this paper,\nwe present RoSE (Reasoning with Orchestrated Streaming Experiences), a general\nframework for solving reasoning tasks that can self-improve without complex\nexternal efforts. To enable RoSE, we describe an architecture that extends an\nLLM to store all answered questions and their thoughts in a streaming\nexperience pool then orchestrates helpful questions from the pool to assist in\nanswering new questions. To set up a question-aware orchestration mechanism,\nRoSE first calculates the similarity of each question in the pool with a new\ntest question. Since the solution to each answered question is not always\ncorrect, RoSE will sort the questions according to their similarity with the\nnew question, and then uniformly divide them into multiple buckets. It finally\nextracts one question from each bucket to make these extracted questions more\ndiverse.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Suite-IN++ achieves superior localization accuracy and\nrobustness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models in real-life\npedestrian tracking scenarios.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u7a7f\u6234\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6Suite-IN++\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u884c\u4eba\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\uff08PDR\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u8bbe\u5907\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6784\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u7a7f\u6234\u7f51\u7edc\uff08flexiwear bodynet\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "Suite-IN++\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5404\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6574\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63ed\u793a\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSuite-IN++\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Suite-IN++\u4e3a\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u7a7f\u6234\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In multilingual RAG\n(mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of\nthe query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively\nutilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving\npassages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly\nfor low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage\ndifferent kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers,\n*independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we\nconduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of\na relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected\nlanguage, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple\n`distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our\nexperiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48\nlanguages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant\ninformation from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate\na full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and\nfeature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages\nnegatively impact answer quality regardless of their language.

Existing methods struggle to\nsimultaneously detect physical and digital attacks due to: 1) significant\nintra-class variations between these attack types, and 2) the inadequacy of\nspatial information alone to comprehensively capture live and fake cues. To\naddress these issues, we propose a unified attack detection model termed\nFrequency-Aware and Attack-Agnostic CLIP (FA\\textsuperscript{3}-CLIP), which\nintroduces attack-agnostic prompt learning to express generic live and fake\ncues derived from the fusion of spatial and frequency features, enabling\nunified detection of live faces and all categories of attacks. Specifically,\nthe attack-agnostic prompt module generates generic live and fake prompts\nwithin the language branch to extract corresponding generic representations\nfrom both live and fake faces, guiding the model to learn a unified feature\nspace for unified attack detection. Meanwhile, the module adaptively generates\nthe live/fake conditional bias from the original spatial and frequency\ninformation to optimize the generic prompts accordingly, reducing the impact of\nintra-class variations. We further propose a dual-stream cues fusion framework\nin the vision branch, which leverages frequency information to complement\nsubtle cues that are difficult to capture in the spatial domain. In addition, a\nfrequency compression block is utilized in the frequency stream, which reduces\nredundancy in frequency features while preserving the diversity of crucial\ncues.

Previous methods have attempted to achieve\nclassification by learning a comprehensive feature space. However, these\nmethods have not adequately accounted for the inherent characteristics of\nphysical and digital attack data, particularly the large intra class variation\nin attacks and the small inter-class variation between live and fake faces. To\naddress these limitations, we propose the Fine-Grained MoE with Class-Aware\nRegularization CLIP framework (FG-MoE-CLIP-CAR), incorporating key improvements\nat both the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, we employ a Soft\nMixture of Experts (Soft MoE) architecture to leverage different experts for\nspecialized feature processing. Additionally, we refine the Soft MoE to capture\nmore subtle differences among various types of fake faces. At the loss level,\nwe introduce two constraint modules: the Disentanglement Module (DM) and the\nCluster Distillation Module (CDM). The DM enhances class separability by\nincreasing the distance between the centers of live and fake face classes.\nHowever, center-to-center constraints alone are insufficient to ensure\ndistinctive representations for individual features. Thus, we propose the CDM\nto further cluster features around their respective class centers while\nmaintaining separation from other classes. Moreover, specific attacks that\nsignificantly deviate from common attack patterns are often overlooked.

Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Low-level Experts\nInjection (ALEI) framework. Our approach introduces Lora Experts, enabling the\nbackbone network, which is trained with high-level semantic RGB images, to\naccept and learn knowledge from different low-level information. We utilize a\ncross-attention method to adaptively fuse these features at intermediate\nlayers.

However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and\ncostly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models\nfor direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained\nimages into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution.\nNevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant\nchallenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and\nthe inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment\nNetwork (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style\nDistribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC\nensures consistency between the generated and target images' style\ndistributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural\nconsistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation,\nthe FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks:\nimage reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological\nconsistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological\npattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate\nthat our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise\ntransformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts.

However, they are primarily based on\nreconstructing pixel-level details on natural videos which have substantial\ntemporal redundancy, limiting their capability for semantic representation and\nsufficient encoding of motion dynamics. To address these issues, this paper\nintroduces a novel SSL approach for video representation learning, dubbed as\nSMILE, by infusing both spatial and motion semantics. In SMILE, we leverage\nimage-language pretrained models, such as CLIP, to guide the learning process\nwith their high-level spatial semantics. We enhance the representation of\nmotion by introducing synthetic motion patterns in the training data, allowing\nthe model to capture more complex and dynamic content. Furthermore, using\nSMILE, we establish a new self-supervised video learning paradigm capable of\nlearning strong video representations without requiring any natural video data.\nWe have carried out extensive experiments on 7 datasets with various downstream\nscenarios.

Existing transformation-based methods regard\npseudo-changes as a kind of style shift and alleviate it by transforming\nbitemporal images into the same style using generative adversarial networks\n(GANs).

However, its effectiveness in\nmedical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally\ndiffers from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and\ndecision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive\ninvestigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a\nsimple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning\ncapability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks\ndemonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning,\nenabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new\nstate-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale\nmedical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of\napproximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking.\nBudget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts,\nhelps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall\nmedical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into\npreviously correct responses.

By selecting the most relevant tokens and softly compressing\nothers, QG-VTC ensures fine-tuned relevance to user needs. Additionally, a\nprogressive strategy applies this compression across different vision encoder\nlayers, gradually reducing token numbers. This approach maximizes retention of\nquestion-relevant information while discarding irrelevant details. Experimental\nresults show that our method achieves performance on par with uncompressed\nmodels using just 1/8 of the visual tokens. The code and model will be publicly\navailable on GitHub.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQG-VTC\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u524d\u9988\u5c42\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "QG-VTC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3aMLLM-based VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g.,\nthree-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training\nviews, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many\nexisting approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D\ngenerative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this\npaper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple\nchanges in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians\nduring the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows\nnon-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their\nvisibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the\noptimization process for rendering with sparse input views.

A traditional approach, Self-Consistency\n(SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common\nanswer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each\nsolution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent\nadvancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a\nnext-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis.\nSpecifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score\neach solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental\ntrade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate\nfewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address\nthis, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget.\nInterestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most\npractical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance,\nGenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and\nrequires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive\ninference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal\ninference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the\nnumber of verifications.

SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide between external\nretrieval and verbalizing its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design\na multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM on knowledge source\nselection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. We further\nintroduce dynamic knowledge source inference via nearest neighbor search to\nimprove the accuracy of knowledge source decision under domain shifts.\nFine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response\naccuracy and inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval\nbaseline, SR-RAG reduces retrievals by 29% while improving the performance by\n5.1%.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSelf-Routing RAG (SR-RAG)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u6216LLM\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u63a8\u65ad\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "SR-RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8629%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "SR-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional PET systems\ntypically rely on complete detector rings to achieve full angular coverage for\nuniform and statistically robust sampling of coincidence events. However,\nincomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged in various scenarios due to hardware\nfailures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. In such cases,\nconventional reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance\ndegradation due to reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies.\nThis thesis proposes a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework for\nincomplete-ring PET scanners. The framework first employs an Attention U-Net\nmodel to recover complete sinograms from incomplete ones, then uses the OSEM\nalgorithm for preliminary reconstruction, and finally applies a two-stage\narchitecture comprising a Coarse Prediction Module (CPM) and an Iterative\nRefinement Module (IRM) for fine reconstruction.

AgentNet's core design is built upon several\nkey innovations: (1) Fully Decentralized Paradigm: Removing the central\norchestrator, allowing agents to coordinate and specialize autonomously,\nfostering fault tolerance and emergent collective intelligence. (2) Dynamically\nEvolving Graph Topology: Real-time adaptation of agent connections based on\ntask demands, ensuring scalability and resilience.(3) Adaptive Learning for\nExpertise Refinement: A retrieval-based memory system that enables agents to\ncontinuously update and refine their specialized skills. By eliminating\ncentralized control, AgentNet enhances fault tolerance, promotes scalable\nspecialization, and enables privacy-preserving collaboration across\norganizations. Through decentralized coordination and minimal data exchange,\nagents can leverage diverse knowledge sources while safeguarding sensitive\ninformation.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAgentNet\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u95ee\u9898\u963b\u788d\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u5316\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "AgentNet\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentNet\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

These cohorts were composed\nexclusively of difficult cases where the diagnosing pathologists required IHC\nto finalize the diagnosis. The AI model demonstrated area under the curve\nvalues of 0.951-0.993 for detecting cancer in routine H&E-stained slides.\nApplying sensitivity-prioritized diagnostic thresholds reduced the need for IHC\nstaining by 44.4%, 42.0%, and 20.7% in the three cohorts investigated, without\na single false negative prediction. This AI model shows potential for\noptimizing IHC use, streamlining decision-making in prostate pathology, and\nalleviating resource burdens.", "AI": {"task": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\u67d3\u8272\uff08IHC\uff09\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e14IHC\u67d3\u8272\u589e\u52a0\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002AI\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7bH&E\u67d3\u8272\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5178\u578b\u817a\u4f53\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f62\u6001\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9IHC\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81ea\u4e09\u4e2a\u75c5\u7406\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u524d\u5217\u817a\u6838\u5fc3\u9488\u6d3b\u68c0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728H&E\u67d3\u8272\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728H&E\u67d3\u8272\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u764c\u75c7\u7684AUC\u503c\u4e3a0.951-0.993\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9608\u503c\u53ef\u5c06IHC\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1144.4%\u300142.0%\u548c20.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u5047\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5AI\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u4f18\u5316IHC\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u524d\u5217\u817a\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u8d44\u6e90\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

While recent multimodal MIL pretraining\napproaches leveraging auxiliary modalities have demonstrated performance gains\nover unimodal WSI pretraining, the acquisition of these additional modalities\nnecessitates extensive clinical profiling. This requirement increases costs and\nlimits scalability in existing WSI datasets lacking such paired modalities. To\naddress this, we propose Gigapixel Vision-Concept Knowledge Contrastive\npretraining (GECKO), which aligns WSIs with a Concept Prior derived from the\navailable WSIs. First, we derive an inherently interpretable concept prior by\ncomputing the similarity between each WSI patch and textual descriptions of\npredefined pathology concepts. GECKO then employs a dual-branch MIL network:\none branch aggregates patch embeddings into a WSI-level deep embedding, while\nthe other aggregates the concept prior into a corresponding WSI-level concept\nembedding. Both aggregated embeddings are aligned using a contrastive\nobjective, thereby pretraining the entire dual-branch MIL model. Moreover, when\nauxiliary modalities such as transcriptomics data are available, GECKO\nseamlessly integrates them. Across five diverse tasks, GECKO consistently\noutperforms prior unimodal and multimodal pretraining approaches while also\ndelivering clinically meaningful interpretability that bridges the gap between\ncomputational models and pathology expertise.

One particularly intriguing application is transforming\ncharacters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows\nplayers to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite\ncharacters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are\ndefined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and\nfixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through\nopen-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments.\nRecently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs\nlarge language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into\nlanguage instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical\nvisual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only\ngenerates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an\nengaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built\nupon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state,\nincluding dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates\nto character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel\naction-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can\nbe decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model.

To that end, prior works have proposed to combine\nseveral motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of\nconditions, thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However, the\nproposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the\ngeneration processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained\ngenerative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context,\nwe introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for\ncombining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models.

Recently, foundation models\n(FMs) have shown excellent results for segmenting remote sensing images by\nutilizing pre-training on large datasets using self-supervised techniques.\nHowever, their effectiveness for sea ice segmentation remains unexplored,\nespecially given sea ice's complex structures, seasonal changes, and unique\nspectral signatures, as well as peculiar Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery\ncharacteristics including banding and scalloping noise, and varying ice\nbackscatter characteristics, which are often missing in standard remote sensing\npre-training datasets.

Traditional rule-based methods rely on hand-crafted\nprinciples, limiting motion diversity and realism in generated collective\nbehaviors. Recent imitation learning methods learn from data but often require\nground truth motion trajectories and struggle with authenticity, especially in\nhigh-density groups with erratic movements. In this paper, we present a\nscalable approach, Collective Behavior Imitation Learning (CBIL), for learning\nfish schooling behavior directly from videos, without relying on captured\nmotion trajectories. Our method first leverages Video Representation Learning,\nwhere a Masked Video AutoEncoder (MVAE) extracts implicit states from video\ninputs in a self-supervised manner. The MVAE effectively maps 2D observations\nto implicit states that are compact and expressive for following the imitation\nlearning stage. Then, we propose a novel adversarial imitation learning method\nto effectively capture complex movements of the schools of fish, allowing for\nefficient imitation of the distribution for motion patterns measured in the\nlatent space. It also incorporates bio-inspired rewards alongside priors to\nregularize and stabilize training. Once trained, CBIL can be used for various\nanimation tasks with the learned collective motion priors. We further show its\neffectiveness across different species.

The primary task of existing\nattribution methods lies in efficiently and accurately identifying the\nrelationships among input-prediction interactions. Particularly when the input\ndata is discrete, such as images, analyzing the relationship between inputs and\noutputs poses a significant challenge due to the combinatorial explosion. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and efficient black-box attribution mechanism,\nLiMA (Less input is More faithful for Attribution), which reformulates the\nattribution of important regions as an optimization problem for submodular\nsubset selection. First, to accurately assess interactions, we design a\nsubmodular function that quantifies subset importance and effectively captures\ntheir impact on decision outcomes. Then, efficiently ranking input sub-regions\nby their importance for attribution, we improve optimization efficiency through\na novel bidirectional greedy search algorithm. LiMA identifies both the most\nand least important samples while ensuring an optimal attribution boundary that\nminimizes errors. Extensive experiments on eight foundation models demonstrate\nthat our method provides faithful interpretations with fewer regions and\nexhibits strong generalization, shows an average improvement of 36.3% in\nInsertion and 39.6% in Deletion. Our method also outperforms the naive greedy\nsearch in attribution efficiency, being 1.6 times faster. Furthermore, when\nexplaining the reasons behind model prediction errors, the average highest\nconfidence achieved by our method is, on average, 86.1% higher than that of\nstate-of-the-art attribution algorithms.

The core of this task lies in making appropriate plans\nbased on the perception of the visual environment. Existing methods often\ngenerate plans in a once-for-all manner, i.e., one-step planning. Such approach\nrely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment.\nConsidering multi-step planning, the framework for formulating plans in a\nsequential manner is proposed in this paper. To ensure the ability of our\nframework to tackle complex questions, we create a structured semantic space,\nwhere hierarchical visual perception and chain expression of the question\nessence can achieve iterative interaction. This space makes sequential task\nplanning possible. Within the framework, we first parse human natural language\nbased on a visual hierarchical scene graph, which can clarify the intention of\nthe question. Then, we incorporate external rules to make a plan for current\nstep, weakening the reliance on large models.

Leveraging the VAE, we train a video diffusion model to\nmodel the distribution of point map sequences conditioned on the input videos.\nExtensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that GeometryCrafter\nachieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy, temporal consistency, and generalization\ncapability.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGeometryCrafter\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u5c04\u4e0d\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeometryCrafter\u57283D\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "GeometryCrafter\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u76843D/4D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
