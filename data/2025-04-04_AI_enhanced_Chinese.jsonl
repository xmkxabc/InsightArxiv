To investigate this, we conducted a\nstudy where participants either engaged in conversations with an AI chatbot (N\n= 334) or wrote journal entires (N = 193) on the same randomly assigned topics\nand reported their momentary happiness afterward. We found that happiness after\nAI chatbot conversations was higher than after journaling, particularly when\ndiscussing negative topics such as depression or guilt. Leveraging large\nlanguage models for sentiment analysis, we found that the AI chatbot mirrored\nparticipants' sentiment while maintaining a consistent positivity bias. When\ndiscussing negative topics, participants gradually aligned their sentiment with\nthe AI's positivity, leading to an overall increase in happiness. We\nhypothesized that the history of participants' sentiment prediction errors, the\ndifference between expected and actual emotional tone when responding to the AI\nchatbot, might explain this happiness effect.

In this\npaper, we address both limitations by introducing Multi-Dimensional Pruning\n(MDP), a novel paradigm that jointly optimizes across a variety of pruning\ngranularities-including channels, query, key, heads, embeddings, and blocks.\nMDP employs an advanced latency modeling technique to accurately capture\nlatency variations across all prunable dimensions, achieving an optimal balance\nbetween latency and accuracy. By reformulating pruning as a Mixed-Integer\nNonlinear Program (MINLP), MDP efficiently identifies the optimal pruned\nstructure across all prunable dimensions while respecting latency constraints.\nThis versatile framework supports both CNNs and transformers.

Specifically, there are no works on\nBangla text-to-gloss translation task. To address this gap, we begin by\naddressing the dataset problem. We take inspiration from grammatical rule based\ngloss generation used in Germany and American sign langauage (ASL) and adapt it\nfor BdSL. We also leverage LLM to generate synthetic data and use\nback-translation, text generation for data augmentation. With dataset prepared,\nwe started experimentation. We fine-tuned pretrained mBART-50 and\nmBERT-multiclass-uncased model on our dataset. We also trained GRU, RNN and a\nnovel seq-to-seq model with multi-head attention. We observe significant high\nperformance (ScareBLEU=79.53) with fine-tuning pretrained mBART-50 multilingual\nmodel from Facebook. We then explored why we observe such high performance with\nmBART. We soon notice an interesting property of mBART -- it was trained on\nshuffled and masked text data. And as we know, gloss form has shuffling\nproperty. So we hypothesize that mBART is inherently good at text-to-gloss\ntasks. To find support against this hypothesis, we trained mBART-50 on\nPHOENIX-14T benchmark and evaluated it with existing literature. Our mBART-50\nfinetune demonstrated State-of-the-Art performance on PHOENIX-14T benchmark,\nfar outperforming existing models in all 6 metrics (ScareBLEU = 63.89, BLEU-1 =\n55.14, BLEU-2 = 38.07, BLEU-3 = 27.13, BLEU-4 = 20.68, COMET = 0.624).

To address these issues, we introduce a novel concept of Knowledge\nDeletion (KD), an advanced task that considers both concerns, and provides an\nappropriate metric, named Knowledge Retention score (KR), for assessing\nknowledge retention in feature space. To achieve this, we propose a novel\ntraining-free erasing approach named Erasing Space Concept (ESC), which\nrestricts the important subspace for the forgetting knowledge by eliminating\nthe relevant activations in the feature.

Extensive experiments on two\nbenchmark datasets, Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that LearNAT enables a\n7B-parameter open-source LLM to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4, while\noffering improved efficiency and accessibility.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLearNAT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742NL2SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NL2SQL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ed\u6e90LLM\u6216\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u63a5\u8868\u8fbe\u53ca\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "LearNAT\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u793a\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728Spider\u548cBIRD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLearNAT\u4f7f7B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LearNAT\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742NL2SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for\nlong-form video understanding, studying a fundamental issue pertaining to all\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). In\nparticular, our contributions are two-fold: First, we formulate temporal search\nas a Long Video Haystack problem, i.e., finding a minimal set of relevant\nframes (typically one to five) among tens of thousands of frames from\nreal-world long videos given specific queries. To validate our formulation, we\ncreate LV-Haystack, the first benchmark containing 3,874 human-annotated\ninstances with fine-grained evaluation metrics for assessing keyframe search\nquality and computational efficiency. Experimental results on LV-Haystack\nhighlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with SOTA\nkeyframe selection methods achieving only 2.1% temporal F1 score on the LVBench\nsubset.\n  Next, inspired by visual search in images, we re-think temporal searching and\npropose a lightweight keyframe searching framework, T*, which casts the\nexpensive temporal search as a spatial search problem. T* leverages superior\nvisual localization capabilities typically used in images and introduces an\nadaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial\ndimensions.

To address this, we introduce two key components into the\nframework: one is the multi-axis region attention network to extract global\ncontext-sensitive features, and the other is the dual-branch multimodal\nembedding to learn multimodal embeddings from both task-shared and\ntask-specific features. The former uses a multi-attention mechanism to extract\ntask-relevant features, mitigating negative transfer caused by task-unrelated\nfeatures. The latter employs a dual-branch structure to adaptively adjust\ntask-shared and task-specific parameters, enhancing cross-task knowledge\ntransfer while reducing task conflicts.

The mainstream DG methods focus on\nlearning domain invariance, however, such methods overlook the potential\ninherent in domain-specific information. While the prevailing practice of\ndiscriminative linear classifier has been tailored to domain-invariant\nfeatures, it struggles when confronted with diverse domain-specific\ninformation, e.g., intra-class shifts, that exhibits multi-modality. To address\nthese issues, we explore the theoretical implications of relying on domain\ninvariance, revealing the crucial role of domain-specific information in\nmitigating the target risk for DG. Drawing from these insights, we propose\nGenerative Classifier-driven Domain Generalization (GCDG), introducing a\ngenerative paradigm for the DG classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) for each class across domains. GCDG consists of three key modules:\nHeterogeneity Learning Classifier~(HLC), Spurious Correlation Blocking~(SCB),\nand Diverse Component Balancing~(DCB). Concretely, HLC attempts to model the\nfeature distributions and thereby capture valuable domain-specific information\nvia GMMs. SCB identifies the neural units containing spurious correlations and\nperturbs them, mitigating the risk of HLC learning spurious patterns.\nMeanwhile, DCB ensures a balanced contribution of components in HLC, preventing\nthe underestimation or neglect of critical components.

To bridge this gap and\nstimulate further research, we introduce the first HRSI-SOD dataset, termed\nHRSSD, which includes 704 hyperspectral images and 5327 pixel-level annotated\nsalient objects. The HRSSD dataset poses substantial challenges for salient\nobject detection algorithms due to large scale variation, diverse\nforeground-background relations, and multi-salient objects.

However, research on text-driven talking\nheads remains underexplored, with existing methods predominantly adopting a\ncascaded pipeline that combines TTS systems with audio-driven talking head\nmodels. This conventional pipeline not only introduces system complexity and\nlatency overhead but also fundamentally suffers from asynchronous audiovisual\noutput and stylistic discrepancies between generated speech and visual\nexpressions. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniTalker, an\nend-to-end unified framework that simultaneously generates synchronized speech\nand talking head videos from text and reference video in real-time zero-shot\nscenarios, while preserving both speech style and facial styles. The framework\nemploys a dual-branch diffusion transformer architecture: the audio branch\nsynthesizes mel-spectrograms from text, while the visual branch predicts\nfine-grained head poses and facial dynamics. To bridge modalities, we introduce\na novel audio-visual fusion module that integrates cross-modal information to\nensure temporal synchronization and stylistic coherence between audio and\nvisual outputs.

To address these issues, we propose a pretraining-free local structure\nfitting network for few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation, named\nTaylorSeg. Specifically, inspired by Taylor series, we treat the local\nstructure representation of irregular point clouds as a polynomial fitting\nproblem and propose a novel local structure fitting convolution, called\nTaylorConv. This convolution learns the low-order basic information and\nhigh-order refined information of point clouds from explicit encoding of local\ngeometric structures.

Despite its simplicity, LiDAR captures only the near\nside of objects, making center-based detectors prone to poor localization\naccuracy in cross-domain tasks with varying point distributions.

These inconsistencies may manifest as\ncontradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous\nconclusions in specific contexts.

While conventional\ncaptioning models exhibit high performance on established metrics such as BLEU,\nCIDEr, and SPICE, the capability of captions to distinguish the target image\nfrom other similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions,\na few pioneers employed contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth\ncaptions. However, these approaches often overlook the relationships among\nobjects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same\nalbum or fine-grained events). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to\nenhance the distinctiveness of image captions, namely Group-based Differential\nDistinctive Captioning Method, which visually compares each image with other\nimages in one similar group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In\nparticular, we introduce a Group-based Differential Memory Attention (GDMA)\nmodule, designed to identify and emphasize object features in an image that are\nuniquely distinguishable within its image group, i.e., those exhibiting low\nsimilarity with objects in other images. This mechanism ensures that such\nunique object features are prioritized during caption generation for the image,\nthereby enhancing the distinctiveness of the resulting captions. To further\nrefine this process, we select distinctive words from the ground-truth captions\nto guide both the language decoder and the GDMA module. Additionally, we\npropose a new evaluation metric, the Distinctive Word Rate (DisWordRate), to\nquantitatively assess caption distinctiveness.

It includes a\ntotal of 1,632 high-quality instances, which were carefully annotated from\n2,456 candidates by 68 expert annotators, ensuring that the benchmark can\nprovide an accurate and reliable evaluation. Based on Multi-SWE-bench, we\nevaluate a series of state-of-the-art models using three representative methods\n(Agentless, SWE-agent, and OpenHands) and present a comprehensive analysis with\nkey empirical insights. In addition, we launch a Multi-SWE-RL open-source\ncommunity, aimed at building large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training\ndatasets for issue-resolving tasks. As an initial contribution, we release a\nset of 4,723 well-structured instances spanning seven programming languages,\nlaying a solid foundation for RL research in this domain. More importantly, we\nopen-source our entire data production pipeline, along with detailed tutorials,\nencouraging the open-source community to continuously contribute and expand the\ndataset. We envision our Multi-SWE-bench and the ever-growing Multi-SWE-RL\ncommunity as catalysts for advancing RL toward its full potential, bringing us\none step closer to the dawn of AGI.", "AI": {"task": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Multi-SWE-bench\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982SWE-bench\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9Python\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4ece2,456\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa1,632\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6Java\u3001TypeScript\u7b49\u4e03\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Agentless\u3001SWE-agent\u3001OpenHands\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Multi-SWE-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u4e864,723\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "Multi-SWE-bench\u548cMulti-SWE-RL\u793e\u533a\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AGI\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary.

We\ntrain various versions of YOLOv8 for instance segmentation on static images and\nassess their performance on the test dataset (videos). The best results were\nachieved by the YOLOv8-nano model (runnable on a portable device), with an\nmAP50 of $88.94%$ on the validation dataset and $81.21%$ macro average on the\ntest dataset. The results provide a baseline for future research in rip current\nsegmentation. Our work contributes to the existing literature by introducing a\ndetailed, annotated dataset, and training a deep learning model for instance\nsegmentation of rip currents.

However, the performance of learned\nbi-directional video compression (LBVC) still lags behind traditional\nbi-directional coding. The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate\nlong-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in\nlarge motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes\na novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion\nestimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions.\nSpecifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and\nnon-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large\nmotions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to\nestimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction\nmodule that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the\naccuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference\nframes during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training.\nExperiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets\nunder random access configuration.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684LBVC\u6846\u67b6\uff08L-LBVC\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\uff08LBVC\uff09\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LBVC\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u5411\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u65f6\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7d2f\u79ef\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u957f\u65f6\u6d41\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "L-LBVC\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LVC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aVVC\uff08VTM\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "L-LBVC\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LBVC\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Realistic analysis of Leukemia\nrequires White Blook Cells (WBC) localization, classification, and\nmorphological assessment. Despite deep learning advances in medical imaging,\nleukemia analysis lacks a large, diverse multi-task dataset, while existing\nsmall datasets lack domain diversity, limiting real world applicability. To\novercome dataset challenges, we present a large scale WBC dataset named Large\nLeukemia Dataset (LLD) and novel methods for detecting WBC with their\nattributes. Our contribution here is threefold. First, we present a large-scale\nLeukemia dataset collected through Peripheral Blood Films (PBF) from several\npatients, through multiple microscopes, multi cameras, and multi magnification.\nTo enhance diagnosis explainability and medical expert acceptance, each\nleukemia cell is annotated at 100x with 7 morphological attributes, ranging\nfrom Cell Size to Nuclear Shape. Secondly, we propose a multi task model that\nnot only detects WBCs but also predicts their attributes, providing an\ninterpretable and clinically meaningful solution. Third, we propose a method\nfor WBC detection with attribute analysis using sparse annotations. This\napproach reduces the annotation burden on hematologists, requiring them to mark\nonly a small area within the field of view. Our method enables the model to\nleverage the entire field of view rather than just the annotated regions,\nenhancing learning efficiency and diagnostic accuracy.

Although numerous deep learning-based turbulence mitigation\n(TM) methods have been proposed, many are slow, memory-hungry, and do not\ngeneralize well. In the spatial domain, methods based on convolutional\noperators have a limited receptive field, so they cannot handle a large spatial\ndependency required by turbulence. In the temporal domain, methods relying on\nself-attention can, in theory, leverage the lucky effects of turbulence, but\ntheir quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale to many frames.\nTraditional recurrent aggregation methods face parallelization challenges.\n  In this paper, we present a new TM method based on two concepts: (1) A\nturbulence mitigation network based on the Selective State Space Model\n(MambaTM). MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across\nspatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational\ncomplexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD).

In computer vision domain, Vision Transformer demonstrates remarkable\nperformance on par with or even surpassing that of convolutional neural\nnetworks. However, the quadratic computational complexity of its self-attention\nmechanism poses challenges for classical computing, making model training with\nhigh-dimensional input data, e.g., images, particularly expensive. To address\nsuch limitations, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformer (HQViT), that\nleverages the principles of quantum computing to accelerate model training\nwhile enhancing model performance. HQViT introduces whole-image processing with\namplitude encoding to better preserve global image information without\nadditional positional encoding. By leveraging quantum computation on the most\ncritical steps and selectively handling other components in a classical way, we\nlower the cost of quantum resources for HQViT. The qubit requirement is\nminimized to $O(log_2N)$ and the number of parameterized quantum gates is only\n$O(log_2d)$, making it well-suited for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum\ndevices. By offloading the computationally intensive attention coefficient\nmatrix calculation to the quantum framework, HQViT reduces the classical\ncomputational load by $O(T^2d)$. Extensive experiments across various computer\nvision datasets demonstrate that HQViT outperforms existing models, achieving a\nmaximum improvement of up to $10.9\\%$ (on the MNIST 10-classification task)\nover the state of the art.

Domestic\nservice robots with monitoring capabilities can enhance safety and provide\nessential support. Although image-based methods have advanced considerably in\nthe past decade, their adoption remains limited by concerns over privacy and\nsensitivity to low-light or dark conditions. As an alternative, millimetre-wave\n(mmWave) radar can produce point cloud data which is privacy-preserving.\nHowever, processing the sparse and noisy point clouds remains a long-standing\nchallenge. While graph-based methods and attention mechanisms show promise,\nthey predominantly rely on \"fixed\" kernels; kernels that are applied uniformly\nacross all neighbourhoods, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches that\ncan dynamically adjust their kernels to the specific geometry of each local\nneighbourhood in point cloud data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an\nadaptive approach within the graph convolutional framework. Instead of a single\nshared weight function, our Multi-Head Adaptive Kernel (MAK) module generates\nmultiple dynamic kernels, each capturing different aspects of the local feature\nspace. By progressively refining local features while maintaining global\nspatial context, our method enables convolution kernels to adapt to varying\nlocal features.

A more practical 2024 method for\nthis task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 25X faster and 13%\nmore accurate than GenFlow. Methods have a similar ranking on 6D detection as\non 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen\nobjects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21% relative improvement compared\nto the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen\nobjects is still noticealy (-53%) behind the accuracy for seen objects\n(GDet2023).

While conventional CNNs inherently support\ntranslational equivariance, extending this property to rotation and reflection\nhas proven challenging, often forcing a compromise between equivariance,\nefficiency, and information loss. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture\nRing Convolution (GMR-Conv), an efficient convolution kernel that smooths\nradial symmetry using a mixture of Gaussian-weighted rings. This design\nmitigates discretization errors of circular kernels, thereby preserving robust\nrotation and reflection equivariance without incurring computational overhead.\nWe further optimize both the space and speed efficiency of GMR-Conv via a novel\nparameterization and computation strategy, allowing larger kernels at an\nacceptable cost. Extensive experiments on eight classification and one\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that GMR-Conv not only matches conventional\nCNNs' performance but can also surpass it in applications with orientation-less\ndata.

Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary.

Accurate calibration is a\nprerequisite for reliable perception and planning tasks such as object\ndetection and obstacle avoidance. Many existing LiDAR calibration methods\nrequire overlapping fields of view, while others use external sensing devices\nor postulate a feature-rich environment.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel target-based technique for extrinsic\nSensor-to-Sensor and Sensor-to-Vehicle calibration of multi-LiDAR systems\ncalled CaLiV. This algorithm works for non-overlapping FoVs, as well as\narbitrary calibration targets, and does not require any external sensing\ndevices.

Then, we use the Gaussian\nmixture model-based registration framework GMMCalib to align the point clouds\nin a common calibration frame.

We show that both translational\nand rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method.\nIn addition, all Sensor-to-Vehicle rotation angles can also be calibrated with\nhigh accuracy.

When this content requires\ncompression before processing, e.g., in distributed applications, coding\nmethods must optimize for both visual quality and downstream task performance.\nWe first show that, given the features obtained from the original and the\ndecoded images, an approach to reduce the effect of compression on a task loss\nis to perform rate-distortion optimization (RDO) using the distance between\nfeatures as a distortion metric. However, optimizing directly such a\nrate-distortion trade-off requires an iterative workflow of encoding, decoding,\nand feature evaluation for each coding parameter, which is computationally\nimpractical. We address this problem by simplifying the RDO formulation to make\nthe distortion term computable using block-based encoders. We first apply\nTaylor's expansion to the feature extractor, recasting the feature distance as\na quadratic metric with the Jacobian matrix of the neural network.

The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage\nflight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection\nnetwork is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation\nenvironment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network\nto detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of\nour path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty\nmeasures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of\nlocalization errors and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8\ndetection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false\npositive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal\nparameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the\nfield, when the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude\ninspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects,\nresulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust\nagainst localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the\nflight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly\ndistributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path\nplanner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with\nhigh number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed to\nfind non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path\nplanner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy.

This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility,\nespecially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring\nefficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel\ncomputation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned\nGlobal-Local Transformer (MAGA-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces\ncomputational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by\nenabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than\nhigh-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification\nalignment (MAGA) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge\nthe information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively\naligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across\nvarious fundamental CPath tasks, MAGA-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art\nclassification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to\n10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file\ntransfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of\nour MAGA framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as\na feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and\n(2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and\nhistopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification\ninputs with minimal information loss.

Recent remarkable\nprogress in deep learning-based methods makes it possible to generate\nsatisfactory segmentation results. However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in adapting network parameters to various land cover distributions\nand enhancing the interaction between spatial and frequency domain features. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network\n(AFENet), which integrates two key components: the Adaptive Frequency and\nSpatial feature Interaction Module (AFSIM) and the Selective feature Fusion\nModule (SFM). AFSIM dynamically separates and modulates high- and low-frequency\nfeatures according to the content of the input image. It adaptively generates\ntwo masks to separate high- and low-frequency components, therefore providing\noptimal details and contextual supplementary information for ground object\nfeature representation. SFM selectively fuses global context and local detailed\nfeatures to enhance the network's representation capability. Hence, the\ninteractions between frequency and spatial features are further enhanced.\nExtensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed AFENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
