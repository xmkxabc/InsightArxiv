However, it is unclear whether and how\nvision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as\nhumans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously\ncrafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including\ncolor perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse\ntest scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how\nthese models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and\nmaintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an\nextensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision\nencoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law\n(larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model\nplays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the\nperformance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color\nunderstanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning\nimproves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are\nvision-centric tasks.

Specifically, EMAFusion\nintegrates a taxonomy-based router for familiar query types, a learned router\nfor ambiguous inputs, and a cascading approach that progressively escalates\nfrom cheaper to more expensive models based on multi-judge confidence\nevaluations. Through extensive evaluations, we find EMAFusion outperforms the\nbest individual models by over 2.6 percentage points (94.3% vs. 91.7%), while\nbeing 4X cheaper than the average cost. EMAFusion further achieves a remarkable\n17.1 percentage point improvement over models like GPT-4 at less than 1/20th\nthe cost. Our combined routing approach delivers 94.3% accuracy compared to\ntaxonomy-based (88.1%) and learned model predictor-based (91.7%) methods alone,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our unified strategy.

Typically, gains in one metric is\naccompanied with degradation in others. Early-Exit LLMs (EE-LLMs) efficiently\nnavigate this trade-off space by skipping some of the later model layers when\nit confidently finds an output token early, thus reducing latency without\nimpacting accuracy.

Drawing on research from nonverbal communication and personality\npsychology, we show that brief excerpts (thin slices) reliably predict overall\npresentation quality. Using a novel corpus of over one hundred real-life\nscience talks, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate transcripts\nof full presentations and their thin slices. By correlating LLM-based\nevaluations of short excerpts with full-talk assessments, we determine how much\ninformation is needed for accurate predictions. Our results demonstrate that\nLLM-based evaluations align closely with human ratings, proving their validity,\nreliability, and efficiency. Critically, even very short excerpts (less than 10\npercent of a talk) strongly predict overall evaluations. This suggests that the\nfirst moments of a presentation convey relevant information that is used in\nquality evaluations and can shape lasting impressions. The findings are robust\nacross different LLMs and prompting strategies.

Yet prior work in evaluating the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) in such situations has been\nlimited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, this work first introduces\nCLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with\nHigh-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact\ndilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In\nparticular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects\nof value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work,\nincluding understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as\nwell as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By\nbenchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key\nfindings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet,\nachieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision\nshould be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut\nscenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked\nby human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts,\nindicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments\nalso reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their\nsteerability towards a given value.

This decomposition allows for the\ndevelopment of more flexible and interpretable computational models, moving\nbeyond the traditional view of attention and autoregression as inseparable\nprocesses.

Despite its importance in real-life applications, this ability has\nnot been adequately investigated for state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we\nevaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval ability of over 40 LLMs across 12\nlanguages to understand the source of this ability, using cross-lingual machine\nreading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show\nthat several small, post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context\nretrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their\nestimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our\ninterpretability analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval\nprocess can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer\nretrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training, respectively.\nThe phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck\nlies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of\npost-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that\nlarger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance.

However, ensuring map reliability remains challenging due to\ninconsistencies in crowdsourced data, which suffer from motion blur, lighting\nvariations, adverse weather, and lane marking degradation. This paper\nintroduces CleanMAP, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based\ndistillation framework designed to filter and refine crowdsourced data for\nhigh-confidence HD map updates. CleanMAP leverages an MLLM-driven lane\nvisibility scoring model that systematically quantifies key visual parameters,\nassigning confidence scores (0-10) based on their impact on lane detection. A\nnovel dynamic piecewise confidence-scoring function adapts scores based on lane\nvisibility, ensuring strong alignment with human evaluations while effectively\nfiltering unreliable data. To further optimize map accuracy, a\nconfidence-driven local map fusion strategy ranks and selects the top-k\nhighest-scoring local maps within an optimal confidence range (best score minus\n10%), striking a balance between data quality and quantity. Experimental\nevaluations on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset validate CleanMAP's\neffectiveness, demonstrating that fusing the top three local maps achieves the\nlowest mean map update error of 0.28m, outperforming the baseline (0.37m) and\nmeeting stringent accuracy thresholds (<= 0.32m). Further validation with\nreal-vehicle data confirms 84.88% alignment with human evaluators, reinforcing\nthe model's robustness and reliability. This work establishes CleanMAP as a\nscalable and deployable solution for crowdsourced HD map updates, ensuring more\nprecise and reliable autonomous navigation.

However, these\ntechniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs\nand can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs.\nWhile prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods\nconfront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context\nchanges, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these\nissues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts\n(LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to\npreserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove\nredundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content.\nWe develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the\ncompression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key\ninformation. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external\nblack-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum\nlearning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training\nstrategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the\nDCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information\nintegrity.

In this paper, we present SeeTree, a modular, open source\nembedded system for tree trunk detection and orchard localization that is\ndeployable on any vehicle. Building on our prior work on vision-based in-row\nlocalization using particle filters, SeeTree includes several new capabilities.\nFirst, it provides capacity for full orchard localization including out-of-row\nheadland turning. Second, it includes the flexibility to integrate either\nvisual, GNSS, or wheel odometry in the motion model. During field experiments\nin a commercial orchard, the system converged to the correct location 99% of\nthe time over 800 trials, even when starting with large uncertainty in the\ninitial particle locations. When turning out of row, the system correctly\ntracked 99% of the turns (860 trials representing 43 unique row changes).

In this work, we position fusion depth, scalability, and\ndedicated multimodal capacity as primary factors for effective fusion. We\nintroduce DeepMLF, a novel multimodal language model (LM) with learnable tokens\ntailored toward deep fusion. DeepMLF leverages an audiovisual encoder and a\npretrained decoder LM augmented with multimodal information across its layers.\nWe append learnable tokens to the LM that: 1) capture modality interactions in\na controlled fashion and 2) preserve independent information flow for each\nmodality. These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal\nself-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through\ncross-attention MM Blocks. Serving as dedicated multimodal capacity, this\ndesign enables progressive fusion across multiple layers, providing depth in\nthe fusion process. Our training recipe combines modality-specific losses and\nlanguage modelling loss, with the decoder LM tasked to predict ground truth\npolarity. Across three MSA benchmarks with varying dataset characteristics,\nDeepMLF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results confirm that deeper\nfusion leads to better performance, with optimal fusion depths (5-7) exceeding\nthose of existing approaches. Additionally, our analysis on the number of\nfusion tokens reveals that small token sets ($\\sim$20) achieve optimal\nperformance. We examine the importance of representation learning order (fusion\ncurriculum) through audiovisual encoder initialization experiments.

This paper presents a novel prototype for a low power\nGPU based patrolling system to be deployed in an urban environment on\nsurveillance vehicles for automated vehicle detection, recognition and\ntracking. In this work, we propose a complete ALPR system for Singapore license\nplates having both single and double line creating our own YOLO based network.\nWe focus on unconstrained capture scenarios as would be the case in real world\napplication, where the license plate (LP) might be considerably distorted due\nto oblique views. In this work, we first detect the license plate from the full\nimage using RFB-Net and rectify multiple distorted license plates in a single\nimage. After that, the detected license plate image is fed to our network for\ncharacter recognition.

However, the substantial computational overhead\nassociated with LVLMs presents a new challenge. The primary source of this\ncomputational cost arises from processing hundreds of image tokens. Therefore,\nan effective strategy to mitigate such overhead is to reduce the number of\nimage tokens, a process known as image token pruning. Previous studies on image\ntoken pruning for LVLMs have primarily focused on high level visual\nunderstanding tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. In\ncontrast, guiding vision foundation models to generate accurate visual masks\nbased on textual queries demands precise semantic and spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. Consequently, pruning methods must carefully control individual\nimage tokens throughout the LVLM reasoning process. Our empirical analysis\nreveals that existing methods struggle to adequately balance reductions in\ncomputational overhead with the necessity to maintain high segmentation\naccuracy. In this work, we propose LVLM_CSP, a novel training free visual token\npruning method specifically designed for LVLM based reasoning segmentation\ntasks. LVLM_CSP consists of three stages: clustering, scattering, and pruning.\nInitially, the LVLM performs coarse-grained visual reasoning using a subset of\nselected image tokens. Next, fine grained reasoning is conducted, and finally,\nmost visual tokens are pruned in the last stage. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that LVLM_CSP achieves a 65% reduction in image token inference\nFLOPs with virtually no accuracy degradation, and a 70% reduction with only a\nminor 1% drop in accuracy on the 7B LVLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "LVLM_CSP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eLVLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee4\u724c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "LVLM_CSP\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u4fee\u526a\u3002\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4fee\u526a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLVLM_CSP\u57287B LVLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8665%\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee4\u724c\u63a8\u7406FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c70%\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1%\u3002", "conclusion": "LVLM_CSP\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LVLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework\nexhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different\noutput spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the\nstudent model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different\nvocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors\nwith ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the\nstudent/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from\ndifferent models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the\ndistributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm\nto align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the\nabove, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both\noff-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their\nvocabularies.

To further boost interpretability and\nricher representations, we develop two variants that attempt to improve the\nstandard KAN and GAT: Graph LoRA and Hybrid-KAN LoRA (Learnable GPT). However,\nsystematic evaluations reveal that neither variant outperforms the optimized\nLoRA-enhanced transformer, which achieves 55.249% accuracy on the SST test set,\n99.18% on the CFIMDB dev set, and 89.9% paraphrase detection test accuracy. On\nsonnet generation, we get a CHRF score of 42.097. These findings highlight that\nefficient parameter adaptation via LoRA remains the most effective strategy for\nour tasks: sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and sonnet generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GPT-2\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5982KAN\u548cGAT\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u7684LoRA\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7KAN\u548cGAT\u5728CoT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4e0eMLPs\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548cL2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Graph LoRA\u548cHybrid-KAN LoRA\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684LoRA\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08SST\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c655.249%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cCFIMDB\u5f00\u53d1\u96c699.18%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c89.9%\u7684\u590d\u8ff0\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cCHRF\u5f97\u520642.097\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u5e94\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u590d\u8ff0\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5341\u56db\u884c\u8bd7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Specifically, the OVPG pipeline consists of a raw\nmaterial sampling module, a visual content generation module, and a puzzle rule\ndesign module, which ensures that each evaluation instance is primitive, highly\nrandomized, and uniquely solvable, enabling continual adaptation to the\nevolving capabilities of LMMs. Built upon OVPG, we construct PuzzleBench, a\ndynamic and scalable benchmark comprising 11,840 VQA samples. It features six\ncarefully designed puzzle tasks targeting three core LMM competencies, visual\nrecognition, logical reasoning, and context understanding. PuzzleBench differs\nfrom static benchmarks that quickly become outdated. It enables ongoing dataset\nrefreshing through OVPG and a rich set of open-ended puzzle designs, allowing\nseamless adaptation to the evolving capabilities of LMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6OVPG\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u4e14\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "OVPG\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u539f\u59cb\u6750\u6599\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8c1c\u9898\u89c4\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5177\u6709\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eOVPG\u6784\u5efa\u7684PuzzleBench\u5305\u542b11,840\u4e2aVQA\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u516d\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9LMM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PuzzleBench\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94LMM\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose\nCDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object\ndetectors across scales, views, and scenarios.

The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient\nsolutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and\nuntrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling\nmulti-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and\ninformation redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment\ndiscovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are\nsemantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to\ncapture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to\nemphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve\nmore compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment\nmodeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments\nof distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically\nquery-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval\nloss for end-to-end optimization.

While written\ncommunication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices,\nvoice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as\naccent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social\nidentity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such\nas television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike\npassive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and\nreciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals\nspeak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to\narise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic\naccommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to\nadapt their speech patterns in response to the system.

In recent years,\nresearchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of\nhandling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of\nmodel development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three\narchitectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in\nefficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing\nlong-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture\nhas demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts\nhave been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly\naddress diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an\nefficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion.\nRestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is\ntailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the\ninitial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract\nshallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined\nmulti-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based\nself-attention mechanism.

This paper presents Nondeterministic\nPolynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which\nprovides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can\ngenerate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver:\nwhich provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both\nonline and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and\niii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze\nthe performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha\nmoments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments\nover widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the\nperformances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that\nNPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the\nmost powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\no1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of\ntokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\nDeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem\ninstances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first\never-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable\ntestbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NPPC\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7834\u89e3\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u78be\u538b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5feb\u901f\u7834\u89e3\u6216\u78be\u538b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3LLMs\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "NPPC\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1anpgym\uff08\u751f\u6210NP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u3001npsolver\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u3001npeval\uff08\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eNPPC\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f310%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0DeepSeek-R1\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728NP\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "NPPC\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7834\u89e3\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u78be\u538b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u8fc8\u5411AGI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and\ntextual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR\nexhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to\ndisproportionately emphasize either the reference image features\n(visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant\nfusion through image-to-text conversion).

This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced\nintents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion.

Such universality\ntypically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure\neffective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents\nunique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets\nannotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical\nroad-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce\na novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current\npretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road\nenvironments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D\nobject detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D\ndetection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel\nframework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection\nvia weak supervision.

Remarkably, our model\nachieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an\nindoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization\ncapabilities of our framework.

While this can be\nacceptable for use cases where specific user templates are not predetermined,\nit represents a missed opportunity to enhance security in scenarios where\nintegrating PAD with the fingerprint verification system could significantly\nleverage users' templates, which are the real target of a potential\npresentation attack. This does not mean that a PAD should be specifically\ndesigned for such users; that would imply the availability of many enrolled\nusers' PAI and, consequently, complexity, time, and cost increase. On the\ncontrary, we propose to equip a basic PAD, designed according to the state of\nthe art, with an innovative add-on module called the Closeness Binary Code (CC)\nmodule. The term \"closeness\" refers to a peculiar property of the bona\nfide-related features: in an Euclidean feature space, genuine fingerprints tend\nto cluster in a specific pattern. First, samples from the same finger are close\nto each other, then samples from other fingers of the same user and finally,\nsamples from fingers of other users. This property is statistically verified in\nour previous publication, and further confirmed in this paper.

By\ncombining optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, we develop a method\nto segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify density gradients.\nOur approach calculates two key metrics: the density gradient coefficient\n($\\alpha$) and the minimum effective distance (LD) at which density reaches a\ntarget threshold. We further employ machine learning techniques, specifically\nK-means clustering, to objectively identify uniform and high-variability\nregions within density gradient plots. We demonstrate that these metrics\nprovide an effective screening tool for public transport analyses by revealing\nthe underlying urban structure. Through comparative analysis of two\nrepresentative cities with contrasting urban morphologies (monocentric vs\npolycentric), we establish relationships between density gradient\ncharacteristics and public transport network topologies. Cities with clear\ndensity peaks in their gradient plots indicate distinct urban centers requiring\ndifferent transport strategies than those with more uniform density\ndistributions.

The code and models will be made publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "DanceLCM\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u805a\u7126\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDanceLCM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6bb5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u8f7b\u91cf\u5934\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u805a\u7126\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u4fdd\u771f\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDanceLCM\u4ec5\u97002-4\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DanceLCM\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

To address this problem, a novel target\ndetection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the\nlatest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by\nintroducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient\nmulti-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional\nfeature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively\nenhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small\ntarget detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone\nnetwork solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the\ncontrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex\nscenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection\ndataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the\nrecall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\\% or so compared with\nthe existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly\nimproved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by\nabout 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and\nefficiency.

Nevertheless, its full potential remains\nlargely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance\ndatasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first\nlarge-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning.\nThis dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances,\nand 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object\ncategories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce\nAffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning\nusing 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal\nstructure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align\n3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance\nrecognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat\ndataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain,\nwhile AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen\nand unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863DAffordSplat\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cAffordSplatNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c3DGS\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u7279\u6027\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a213DGS\u529f\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u96c63DAffordSplat\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1AffordSplatNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c3DAffordSplat\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e863DGS\u9886\u57df\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cAffordSplatNet\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "3DAffordSplat\u548cAffordSplatNet\u4e3a3D\u529f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e863DGS\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While recent\nmethods estimate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on\ngeometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from\nthe point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation\nfor 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images,\nleading to suboptimal accuracy, particularly for objects with small parts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for\nestimating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method\ncombines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS\nrepresentations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified\nnetwork to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, centroid offsets,\nand NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted\nclass based on their estimated centroid distances to isolate each part.\nFinally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to\nrecover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real domain gap, we\nintroduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date,\nfeaturing photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real\nsensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.

However, iterative sampling process required for synthesis is very\nresource-intensive. A line of work has focused on distilling solutions to\nprobability flow ODEs into few-step student models. Nevertheless, existing\nmethods have been limited by their reliance on the most recent denoised samples\nas input, rendering them susceptible to exposure bias. To address this\nlimitation, we propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD), a novel approach that\nleverages the historical trajectory of the ODE to predict future steps. ARD\noffers two key benefits: 1) it mitigates exposure bias by utilizing a predicted\nhistorical trajectory that is less susceptible to accumulated errors, and 2) it\nleverages the previous history of the ODE trajectory as a more effective source\nof coarse-grained information. ARD modifies the teacher transformer\narchitecture by adding token-wise time embedding to mark each input from the\ntrajectory history and employs a block-wise causal attention mask for training.\nFurthermore, incorporating historical inputs only in lower transformer layers\nenhances performance and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a\nclass-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis.

In the context of weak supervision,\nclinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its\nsparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models\n(VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the\nexplanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices,\nwe propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language\nsupervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that\ngaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain\nwhy those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first\nlearns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion\nmorphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The\nteacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale\nfeature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2)\nConfidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions;\n(3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments\non the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves\nDice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over\ngaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving\ncorrelations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our\nframework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how\nintegrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can\neffectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals,\nthereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical\nAI systems.

Current\nmethods utilizing airborne or satellite optical imagery to derive bathymetry\nprimarily rely on either SfM-MVS with refraction correction or Spectrally\nDerived Bathymetry (SDB). However, SDB methods often require extensive manual\nfieldwork or costly reference data, while SfM-MVS approaches face challenges\neven after refraction correction. These include depth data gaps and noise in\nenvironments with homogeneous visual textures, which hinder the creation of\naccurate and complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed. To address\nthese challenges, this work introduces a methodology that combines the\nhigh-fidelity 3D reconstruction capabilities of the SfM-MVS methods with\nstate-of-the-art refraction correction techniques, along with the spectral\nanalysis capabilities of a new deep learning-based method for bathymetry\nprediction.

In this context, we propose Swin-BathyUNet that combines\nU-Net with Swin Transformer self-attention layers and a cross-attention\nmechanism, specifically tailored for SDB. Swin-BathyUNet is designed to improve\nbathymetric accuracy by capturing long-range spatial relationships and can also\nfunction as a standalone solution for standard SDB with various training depth\ndata, independent of the SfM-MVS output. Experimental results in two completely\ndifferent test sites in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments that\ndemonstrate improvements in bathymetric accuracy, detail, coverage, and noise\nreduction in the predicted DSM.
