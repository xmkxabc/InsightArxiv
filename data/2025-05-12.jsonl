Due to diverse and extensive amounts of\ndata recorded, automated processing is necessary. This report describes methods\nto extract and characterize driver head scans at intersections from data\ncollected from an in-car recording system that logged vehicle speed, GPS\nlocation, scene videos, and cabin videos. Custom tools were developed to mark\nthe intersections, synchronize location and video data, and clip the cabin and\nscene videos for +/-100 meters from the intersection location. A\ncustom-developed head pose detection AI model for wide angle head turns was run\non the cabin videos to estimate the driver head pose, from which head scans >20\ndeg were computed in the horizontal direction. The scene videos were processed\nusing a YOLO object detection model to detect traffic lights, stop signs,\npedestrians, and other vehicles on the road. Turning maneuvers were\nindependently detected using vehicle self-motion patterns. Stop lines on the\nroad surface were detected using changing intensity patterns over time as the\nvehicle moved. The information obtained from processing the scene videos, along\nwith the speed data was used in a rule-based algorithm to infer the\nintersection type, maneuver, and bounds. We processed 190 intersections from 3\nvehicles driven in cities and suburban areas from Massachusetts and California.\nThe automated video processing algorithm correctly detected intersection\nsignage and maneuvers in 100% and 94% of instances, respectively. The median\n[IQR] error in detecting vehicle entry into the intersection was 1.1[0.4-4.9]\nmeters and 0.2[0.1-0.54] seconds.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion\nNetwork (MDDFNet), for traffic sign detection.

This creates a bottleneck in\nmemory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory\n(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth\nand compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily\noptimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access\npatterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they\nsuffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization.\nIn this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme\ntailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC\nclusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory\nregions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve\nrelevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed\ncentroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without\nfrequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM\nsystem show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces\nattention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a\nKV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and\n45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC\nmaintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention\nmethods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and\nhardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures."}

PCVS takes a logical specification constraining\nthe existence of privacy-sensitive objects, e.g., never show faces when a\nperson exists. It uses a detection model to evaluate the existence of these\nobjects in each incoming frame.

These challenges include the variability in the scale and\nappearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature\nextent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed\nto improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP\nincorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture\nmulti-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an\nAttention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant\nspatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements\nhelp to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model\nand state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in\nmAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively\nover state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite\ndatasets.

The data processing pipeline automatically\nextracts clean and semantically aligned video-text pairs from the raw videos,\nwhich are subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained Microsoft's X-CLIP model\nthrough Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We obtained an uplift in $Hits@5$ of\n$167\\%$ for the 16 frames model and an uplift of $114\\%$ for the 8 frame model\non our domain data. Moreover, based on $NDCG@K$ results, our model is able to\nrank well most of the considered behaviors, while the tested raw pre-trained\nmodels are not able to rank them at all.

To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid\nlearning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised\nand supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.\n  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the\nfirst stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images\nfrom noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as\npseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to\nrefine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We\nevaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated\n0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of\nthe brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.\n  Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image\nquality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across\ndifferent acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE.

In contrast, although traditional\nprocedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,\nLightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.\nUnfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual\nprocedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In\nthis paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to\ncritique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them\nwith a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate\nthat MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing\noperations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.\nSubsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit\nsequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we\nsynthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits\nand then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize\nreasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by\nconstruction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and\nresolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a\nvariety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and\nidentity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural\nalternatives.

However, CNNs have\nlimited capability for modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformers\nincur quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models such as\nMamba have been recognized as a promising approach for polyp segmentation\nbecause they not only model long-range interactions effectively but also\nmaintain linear computational complexity. However, Mamba-based architectures\nstill struggle to capture topological features (e.g., connected components,\nloops, voids), leading to inaccurate boundary delineation and polyp\nsegmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach called\nTopo-VM-UNetV2, which encodes topological features into the Mamba-based\nstate-of-the-art polyp segmentation model, VM-UNetV2. Our method consists of\ntwo stages: Stage 1: VM-UNetV2 is used to generate probability maps (PMs) for\nthe training and test images, which are then used to compute topology attention\nmaps. Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams of the PMs, then we\ngenerate persistence score maps by assigning persistence values (i.e., the\ndifference between death and birth times) of each topological feature to its\nbirth location, finally we transform persistence scores into attention weights\nusing the sigmoid function. Stage 2: These topology attention maps are\nintegrated into the semantics and detail infusion (SDI) module of VM-UNetV2 to\nform a topology-guided semantics and detail infusion (Topo-SDI) module for\nenhancing the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on five public polyp\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The\ncode will be made publicly available."}

Current humanoid research remains\nfragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills\nwithout long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation\noverlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose\ntraining humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill\ndevelopment across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We\ndevelop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid\nrobot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical\ninnovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into\nHierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals\nto guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed\nnavigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with\nhierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable\nsmooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These\ncomponents allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges\nwithout relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied\nsimulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and\nrobustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy\nand LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development."}
