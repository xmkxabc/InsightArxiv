It integrates DeepFA into a co-training setup that\nimplements two cooperative networks to mitigate confirmation bias from\npseudo-labels. The method starts with a reduced set of labeled samples by\nwarming up the networks with supervised CL.

Next, the most reliable pseudo-labels are exchanged\nbetween networks in a cross-training fashion, while the most meaningful samples\nare annotated and added into the labeled set.

To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast\ninverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main\ncontributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of\ntransparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable\nspecular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we\nleverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light\nand nearby contents in a unified framework.

When\ntrying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they\naccumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and\nlatent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by\nperforming the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing\nflexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion\nediting operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even\nafter many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing:\nusers can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation\nbuilding on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based\noperations and conventional editing techniques.

Animators use the 2D\nsketches in storyboards as references to craft the desired 3D animations\nthrough a trial-and-error process. The traditional approach requires\nexceptional expertise and is both labor-intensive and time-consuming.\nConsequently, there is a high demand for automated methods that can directly\ntranslate 2D storyboard sketches into 3D animations. This task is\nunder-explored to date and inspired by the significant advancements of motion\ndiffusion models, we propose to address it from the perspective of conditional\nmotion synthesis. We thus present Sketch2Anim, composed of two key modules for\nsketch constraint understanding and motion generation. Specifically, due to the\nlarge domain gap between the 2D sketch and 3D motion, instead of directly\nconditioning on 2D inputs, we design a 3D conditional motion generator that\nsimultaneously leverages 3D keyposes, joint trajectories, and action words, to\nachieve precise and fine-grained motion control.

Improving registration quality\nrequires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh.\nExisting image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however\nperform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks,\nand they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while\nscan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel method that accurately separates skin from\nnon-skin geometry on 3D human head scans. For this, our method extracts\nfeatures from multi-view images using a frozen image foundation model and\naggregates these features in 3D.

Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from\n14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved\nsegmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and\ncoronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for\ncardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of\ncoronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion\nanalysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking\nGlass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert\nscale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients\n(including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with\nintraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly\nfor preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0).

The previous studies\nhave emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual\nquality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual\nuncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including\ninconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input\nconditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning\nNetwork (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which\nincorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual\nerror. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually\npredict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.\nThe error map represents the difference between the generated image and the\nground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the\nprobability of incorrect estimates.

Although Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) attempts to\nimprove robustness by introducing noise during training, a key question\nremains: How does this noise-based training affect the underlying\nrepresentation of refusal behavior? Understanding this encoding is crucial for\nevaluating LAT's effectiveness and limitations, just as the discovery of linear\nrefusal directions revealed vulnerabilities in traditional supervised safety\nfine-tuning (SSFT).\n  Through the analysis of Llama 2 7B, we examine how LAT reorganizes the\nrefusal behavior in the model's latent space compared to SSFT and embedding\nspace adversarial training (AT). By computing activation differences between\nharmful and harmless instruction pairs and applying Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), we find that LAT significantly alters the refusal\nrepresentation, concentrating it in the first two SVD components which explain\napproximately 75 percent of the activation differences variance - significantly\nhigher than in reference models.

Identifying these\nvulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such\nexploits. We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating\nadversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of\nThoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024]. GoAT excels at generating highly\neffective jailbreak prompts with fewer queries to the victim model than\nstate-of-the-art attacks, achieving up to five times better jailbreak success\nrate against robust models like Llama. Notably, GoAT creates high-quality,\nhuman-readable prompts without requiring access to the targeted model's\nparameters, making it a black-box attack.

The adoption of sparse proposals streamlines the pipeline by\neliminating the need for proposal generators and post-processing for\noverlapping predictions. The proposed BAPs enrich object representation by\nintegrating ship and background features, allowing the model to learn their\ncontextual relationships for more accurate distinction of ships in complex\nenvironments. To complement BAPs, we propose Dual-Context Pooling (DCP), a\nnovel strategy that jointly extracts ship and background features in a single\nunified operation. This unified design improves efficiency by eliminating\nredundant computation inherent in separate pooling. Moreover, by ensuring that\nship and background features are pooled from the same feature map level, DCP\nprovides aligned features that improve contextual relationship learning.\nFinally, as a core component of contextual relationship learning in R-Sparse\nR-CNN, we design a dedicated transformer-based Interaction Module. This module\ninteracts pooled ship and background features with corresponding proposal\nfeatures and models their relationships.

This\npaper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from\na distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby\nenhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method,\ntranslation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after\nlimited training (2K instances per direction).

Existing methods often fail to\ndecouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric\nattributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this\nissue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework\nthat separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific)\ncomponents in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase\nfeatures through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency,\nand 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates\nhigh-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive\nmultilayer perceptrons.

LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods\nhave garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas\nradar excels in adverse weather resilience.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel UIE method based on spatial-spectral dual-domain adaptive\nlearning, termed SS-UIE. Specifically, we first introduce a spatial-wise\nMulti-scale Cycle Selective Scan (MCSS) module and a Spectral-Wise\nSelf-Attention (SWSA) module, both with linear complexity, and combine them in\nparallel to form a basic Spatial-Spectral block (SS-block). Benefiting from the\nglobal receptive field of MCSS and SWSA, SS-block can effectively model the\ndegradation levels of different spatial regions and spectral bands, thereby\nenabling degradation level-based dual-domain adaptive UIE. By stacking multiple\nSS-blocks, we build our SS-UIE network.

To bridge this gap, we collect a dataset of educational\nquestions based on lectures from real-world classrooms. On this realistic\ndataset, we find that current methods for EQG struggle with accurately\ngenerating questions from educational videos, particularly in aligning with\nspecific timestamps and target answers. Common challenges include selecting\ninformative contexts from extensive transcripts and ensuring generated\nquestions meaningfully incorporate the target answer. To address the\nchallenges, we introduce a novel framework utilizing large language models for\ndynamically selecting and rewriting contexts based on target timestamps and\nanswers. First, our framework selects contexts from both lecture transcripts\nand video keyframes based on answer relevance and temporal proximity. Then, we\nintegrate the contexts selected from both modalities and rewrite them into\nanswer-containing knowledge statements, to enhance the logical connection\nbetween the contexts and the desired answer. This approach significantly\nimproves the quality and relevance of the generated questions.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Object Detection Explainable AI Evaluation\n(ODExAI), a comprehensive framework designed to assess XAI methods in object\ndetection based on three core dimensions: localization accuracy, faithfulness\nto model behavior, and computational complexity. We benchmark a set of XAI\nmethods across two widely used object detectors (YOLOX and Faster R-CNN) and\nstandard datasets (MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC). Empirical results demonstrate that\nregion-based methods (e.g., D-CLOSE) achieve strong localization (PG = 88.49%)\nand high model faithfulness (OA = 0.863), though with substantial computational\noverhead (Time = 71.42s).

To address these issues and\noptimize classification performance, we propose a novel band selection strategy\nknown as Iterative Wavelet-based Gradient Sampling (IWGS). This method\nincrementally selects the most informative spectral bands by analyzing\ngradients within the wavelet-transformed domain, enabling efficient and\ntargeted dimensionality reduction. Unlike traditional selection methods, IWGS\nleverages the multi-resolution properties of wavelets to better capture subtle\nspectral variations relevant for classification. The iterative nature of the\napproach ensures that redundant or noisy bands are systematically excluded\nwhile maximizing the retention of discriminative features. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark HSI datasets: Houston\n2013 and Indian Pines.

Existing methods struggle with challenges such\nas low contrast, morphological variability and small vessel segmentation. To\naddress these limitations, we propose the Myocardial Region-guided Feature\nAggregation Net, a novel U-shaped dual-encoder architecture that integrates\nanatomical prior knowledge to enhance robustness in coronary artery\nsegmentation. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a\nMyocardial Region-guided Module that directs attention to coronary regions via\nmyocardial contour expansion and multi-scale feature fusion, (2) a Residual\nFeature Extraction Encoding Module that combines parallel spatial channel\nattention with residual blocks to enhance local-global feature discrimination,\nand (3) a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module for adaptive aggregation of\nhierarchical vascular features. Additionally, Monte Carlo dropout f quantifies\nprediction uncertainty, supporting clinical interpretability. For stenosis\ndetection, a morphology-based centerline extraction algorithm separates the\nvascular tree into anatomical branches, enabling cross-sectional area\nquantification and stenosis grading. The superiority of MGFA-Net was\ndemonstrated by achieving an Dice score of 85.04%, an accuracy of 84.24%, an\nHD95 of 6.1294 mm, and an improvement of 5.46% in true positive rate for\nstenosis detection compared to3D U-Net.

The\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities\nfor advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of\ndialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents\nunique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and\ninterpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these\nchallenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for\ndialogue data.

In particular, our contextual consistency checking\nprovided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act\npredictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions.

Eight participants filled in a questionnaire, read a\nstory using an eye-tracker, and conducted a retrospective think-aloud (RTA)\ninterview.

Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high\nrequest rates.\n  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system\nlies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational\nresource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose\na novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation\nand unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller\nto achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)\nlevel, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access\nfrom both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism\nbetween the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic\npartitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request\nrates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on\nDeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency\nconstraints on Llama series models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edfsemi-PD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u5b58\u50a8\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8bf7\u6c42\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5219\u56e0\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fasemi-PD\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u533a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "semi-PD\u5728DeepSeek\u548cLlama\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bf7\u6c42\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "semi-PD\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7dLLM\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing\nneed for more capable discriminators.

Crowdsourced fact-checking - where\nnon-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to\nexpert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias.\nEncouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X\n(formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from\ncentralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.\n  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong\nperformance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and\nevidence evaluation.

Our findings reveal that LLMs often\nperform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts.\nNotably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated\nin low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual\nunderstanding capabilities of current LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IndicQuest\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83GPT-4o\u3001Gemma-2-9B\u3001Gemma-2-2B\u548cLlama-3.1-8B\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c19\u79cd\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Additionally, we introduce a refined dataset,\n3DFRONT-NC, which eliminates significant noise presented in the original\ndataset, 3D-FRONT.

Despite\nrecent advances, the scarcity of high-quality data that balances diversity,\nplausibility, and fidelity remains a major obstacle. To address this challenge,\nwe identify three critical elements: leveraging in-the-wild image data for\ndiversity, incorporating human expertise for plausibility, and utilizing\ngenerative priors for fidelity. We propose SynergyAmodal, a novel framework for\nco-synthesizing in-the-wild amodal datasets with comprehensive shape and\nappearance annotations, which integrates these elements through a tripartite\ndata-human-model collaboration. First, we design an occlusion-grounded\nself-supervised learning algorithm to harness the diversity of in-the-wild\nimage data, fine-tuning an inpainting diffusion model into a partial completion\ndiffusion model. Second, we establish a co-synthesis pipeline to iteratively\nfilter, refine, select, and annotate the initial deocclusion results of the\npartial completion diffusion model, ensuring plausibility and fidelity through\nhuman expert guidance and prior model constraints. This pipeline generates a\nhigh-quality paired amodal dataset with extensive category and scale diversity,\ncomprising approximately 16K pairs. Finally, we train a full completion\ndiffusion model on the synthesized dataset, incorporating text prompts as\nconditioning signals.

To investigate these\nchallenges, we surveyed 64 ESL researchers who frequently collaborate in\nmultilingual teams and identified four key design goals around participation,\ncomprehension, documentation, and feedback. Guided by these design goals, we\ndeveloped LINC, a multimodal Language INdependent Collaboration system with two\ncomponents: a real-time module for multilingual communication during meetings\nand a post-meeting dashboard for discussion analysis. We evaluated the system\nthrough a two-phased study with six triads of multilingual teams. We found that\nusing LINC, participants benefited from communicating in their preferred\nlanguage, recalled and reviewed actionable insights, and prepared for upcoming\nmeetings effectively.

A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian\nspectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and\nstructural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a\njoint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral\nregularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters.

This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing\nthe model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is\nevaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons,\nfew-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter\nnetwork (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains\ndataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the\ndiscriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter\nmodel, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data\ndistribution and labeling.

Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch\nnormalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution\ndifferences.

First, the Inter Correlation\nEnhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying\nsemantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining\nthem to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction.\nSecond, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample\nredundancy by mining redundant video moment features and treating them as hard\nnegative samples, thereby encouraging the model to learn more discriminative\nrepresentations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal\nCoherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances feature discrimination by\ntraining the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled\nvideo frames and moments.

HOIGaze\naddresses the challenging HOI setting by building on one key insight: The eye,\nhand, and head movements are closely coordinated during HOIs and this\ncoordination can be exploited to identify samples that are most useful for gaze\nestimator training - as such, effectively denoising the training data. This\ndenoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods\nthat treated all training samples as equal. Specifically, we propose: 1) a\nnovel hierarchical framework that first recognises the hand currently visually\nattended to and then estimates gaze direction based on the attended hand; 2) a\nnew gaze estimator that uses cross-modal Transformers to fuse head and\nhand-object features extracted using a convolutional neural network and a\nspatio-temporal graph convolutional network; and 3) a novel eye-head\ncoordination loss that upgrades training samples belonging to the coordinated\neye-head movements.

Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass\n(or micro-calcification) detection require training with a large volume of\nlabeled images, which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. To\nreduce this challenge, we proposed a novel method that leverages\nself-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named \\textbf{HybMNet},\nwhich combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to\nenhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms.\n  Approach: Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL\nPretraining: We utilize EsViT, a SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer\n(Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms. The pretrained Swin-T then serves\nas the backbone for the downstream task. (2) Downstream Training: The proposed\nHybMNet combines the Swin-T backbone with a CNN-based network and a novel\nfusion strategy. The Swin-T employs local self-attention to identify\ninformative patch regions from the high-resolution mammogram, while the\nCNN-based network extracts fine-grained local features from the selected\npatches. A fusion module then integrates global and local information from both\nnetworks to generate robust predictions. The HybMNet is trained end-to-end,\nwith the loss function combining the outputs of the Swin-T and CNN modules to\noptimize feature extraction and classification performance.\n  Results: The proposed method was evaluated for its ability to detect breast\ncancer by distinguishing between benign (normal) and malignant mammograms.\nLeveraging SSL pretraining and the HybMNet model, it achieved AUC of 0.864 (95%\nCI: 0.852, 0.875) on the CMMD dataset and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.875, 0.903) on the\nINbreast dataset, highlighting its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08HybMNet\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u662fAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0cHybMNet\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08EsViT+Swin-T\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08HybMNet\u7ed3\u5408Swin-T\u548cCNN\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728CMMD\u548cINbreast\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230AUC 0.864\u548c0.889\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "HybMNet\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although existing\ndatasets for OOD in UAV provide valuable resources, they are often designed for\nspecific downstream tasks.Consequently, they exhibit limited generalization\nperformance in real flight scenarios and fail to thoroughly demonstrate\nalgorithm effectiveness in practical environments. To bridge this critical gap,\nwe introduce CODrone, a comprehensive oriented object detection dataset for\nUAVs that accurately reflects real-world conditions. It also serves as a new\nbenchmark designed to align with downstream task requirements, ensuring greater\napplicability and robustness in UAV-based OOD.Based on application\nrequirements, we identify four key limitations in current UAV OOD datasets-low\nimage resolution, limited object categories, single-view imaging, and\nrestricted flight altitudes-and propose corresponding improvements to enhance\ntheir applicability and robustness.Furthermore, CODrone contains a broad\nspectrum of annotated images collected from multiple cities under various\nlighting conditions, enhancing the realism of the benchmark. To rigorously\nevaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel\nchallenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22\nclassical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of\nCODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and\nopportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the\ndata gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced\ngeneralization capability, better aligning with practical applications and\nfuture algorithm development.", "AI": {"tldr": "CODrone\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u591a\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u98de\u884c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002CODrone\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56db\u5927\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff08\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff09\uff0cCODrone\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u591a\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e22\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u6216SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "CODrone\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "conclusion": "CODrone\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Developing such skills requires a large-scale and\nhigh-quality dataset that covers numerous grasp types (i.e., at least those\ncategorized by the GRASP taxonomy), but collecting such data is extremely\nchallenging. Existing automatic grasp synthesis methods are often limited to\nspecific grasp types or object categories, hindering scalability. This work\nproposes an efficient pipeline capable of synthesizing contact-rich,\npenetration-free, and physically plausible grasps for any grasp type, object,\nand articulated hand. Starting from a single human-annotated template for each\nhand and grasp type, our pipeline tackles the complicated synthesis problem\nwith two stages: optimize the object to fit the hand template first, and then\nlocally refine the hand to fit the object in simulation. To validate the\nsynthesized grasps, we introduce a contact-aware control strategy that allows\nthe hand to apply the appropriate force at each contact point to the object.\nThose validated grasps can also be used as new grasp templates to facilitate\nfuture synthesis. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms\nprevious type-unaware grasp synthesis baselines in simulation. Using our\nalgorithm, we construct a dataset containing 10.7k objects and 9.5M grasps,\ncovering 31 grasp types in the GRASP taxonomy.

This research addresses\nthese gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly\nnon-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and\ntasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video\nsnippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their\nconfidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI\narchitectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on\nthe Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset.

From an\nimaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as\nmotion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For\nfunctional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and\nmotion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS\nperforms well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex\nscenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings\ndue to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In\ncomparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and\ncomplex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise,\nhigh-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable\ninsights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and\nsupport further advancement in this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7c7b\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08BVS\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08EVS\uff09\u548cTianmouc\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u56e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cBVS\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u6210\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6027\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "EVS\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u53d7\u9650\uff1bTianmouc\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aBVS\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Deep\nlearning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic\nretinopathy (DR).

Domain\ngeneralization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most\nexisting DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in\ninsufficient accuracy.

These results indicate that the SST-DUNet\ncan effectively substitute manual brain extraction in rat fMRI analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "SST-DUNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6UNet\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u667a\u80fdSwin Transformer\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5265\u79bbfMRI\u4e2d\u7684\u9885\u9aa8\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u53d8\u5207\u7247\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u5265\u79bbfMRI\u4e2d\u7684\u9885\u9aa8\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSST-DUNet\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u96c6UNet\u548c\u667a\u80fdSwin Transformer\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SSW-MSA\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8111\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Focal\u548cDice\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDice\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u522b\u4e3a98.65%\u300197.86%\u548c98.04%\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5265\u79bb\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u5265\u79bb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SST-DUNet\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u624b\u52a8\u9885\u9aa8\u5265\u79bb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u9f20fMRI\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}
