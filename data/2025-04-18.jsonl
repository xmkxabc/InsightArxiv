We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar\nrepresentation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance\nwith details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is\nempowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on\ndifferent positions on human body.

To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during\ninterpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and\na linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative\nto the neutral properties.

While foundation models like Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in\nthe task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing\nadapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building\ndistribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge\nextraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection,\ntypically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises.\nThis affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection\naccuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new\nSAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and\nEdge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet\nutilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing\nimages. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing\nscenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate\ntask-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses\nthe domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed\nbuildings.

We first show, in a\ncontrolled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted\nwith only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We\nthen formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a\nblack-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for \"Response Anomaly Vigilance for\nuncovering semantic backdoors\"), which combines semantic entropy with\ncross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with\nstructured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via\nbidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model\ncomparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases.

While CLIP demonstrates\nremarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature\nspaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text\nfeature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing\nworks attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or\nfine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or\ndegradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a\npost-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and\nfine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training\non small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To\nthis end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and\nhybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features\nto follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random\nreference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid\nsoft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and\noutputs from the pre-trained CLIP model.

MaskMark has two variants: MaskMark-D, which supports global\nwatermark embedding, watermark localization, and local watermark extraction for\napplications such as tamper detection, and MaskMark-ED, which focuses on local\nwatermark embedding and extraction with enhanced robustness in small regions,\nenabling localized image protection. Built upon the classical Encoder-\nDistortion-Decoder training paradigm, MaskMark-D introduces a simple masking\nmechanism during the decoding stage to support both global and local watermark\nextraction. A mask is applied to the watermarked image before extraction,\nallowing the decoder to focus on selected regions and learn local extraction. A\nlocalization module is also integrated into the decoder to identify watermark\nregions during inference, reducing interference from irrelevant content and\nimproving accuracy. MaskMark-ED extends this design by incorporating the mask\ninto the encoding stage as well, guiding the encoder to embed the watermark in\ndesignated local regions for enhanced robustness. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that MaskMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in global watermark\nextraction, local watermark extraction, watermark localization, and\nmulti-watermark embedding. It outperforms all existing baselines, including the\nrecent leading model WAM for local watermarking, while preserving high visual\nquality of the watermarked images. MaskMark is also flexible, by adjusting the\ndistortion layer, it can adapt to different robustness requirements with just a\nfew steps of fine-tuning.

While such capabilities empower various creative\napplications, they also introduce serious privacy concerns, as adversaries can\nexploit them to generate highly realistic impersonations. To counter these\nthreats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial\nperturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization\nmodels. However, existing approaches largely overlook the intrinsic multi-image\nnature of personalization and instead adopt a naive strategy of applying\nperturbations independently, as commonly done in single-image settings. This\nneglects the opportunity to leverage inter-image relationships for stronger\nprivacy protection. Therefore, we advocate for a group-level perspective on\nprivacy protection against personalization.

While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on\ndownstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM\nrepresentations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some\nconcepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause\nthese representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data\nfrequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find\nevidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to\npretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact\ntriplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning\naccuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.\nThis is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we\ndiscover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms\nwhen the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k\ntimes, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during\npretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear\nrepresentation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term\nwas seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a\ndifferent model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method\nfor estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data\nmodels.

To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is\nbuilt on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free\nguidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content\nmodification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This\ninspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the\nearly-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image\nmanifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For\nsingle-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map\nto precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly\ncontribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient\nerasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile\nplug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both\nsingle and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without\ncompromising the generative fidelity.

To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement.

However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents three key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text\npairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support\nin the text-to-image domain.

By\ncomparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains\n-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and\nmolecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach\nallows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,\nas well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic\nperspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better\napproximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework\nof Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic\nprogramming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a\nbroad variety of controlled generation problems."}

Steganography, a technique for embedding secret\nmessages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored\nchannels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making\nstego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational\nindistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current\nPSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative\nmodel for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box\nscenarios.

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various\nmodalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex\nclinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies\nhave demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer\nquestions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical\ncontext due to the patch-level data with limited information from public\ndatasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the\nscalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we\nintroduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as\nChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using\n10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and\nevaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We\ndemonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using\nChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and\nreports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context\nfrom various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential\nto assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of\nWSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities."}

Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,\nand lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and\ndisease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand\ncardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an\nindividual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly\nexploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have\nbegun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data\nand focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a\ncomprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a\ncomprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of\nindividual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,\nViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling\na complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with\ndetailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This\nmulti-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including\ncardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and\nclassification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified\nframework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging\nfeatures and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific\nmodels toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,\nhighlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in\ncardiac analysis."}

In this\npaper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap\nbetween 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity\nscenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key\ninsight is treating scenes as hierarchical \"objects\" under isometric views,\nwhere a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into\nmanipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D\ncontent that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional\nstructure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed\ninstance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that\neffectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape\nprior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements\nand complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while\nmaintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs."}

The challenge comprises two tracks:\n(i) Efficient Video Quality Assessment (KVQ), and (ii) Diffusion-based Image\nSuper-Resolution (KwaiSR). Track 1 aims to advance the development of\nlightweight and efficient video quality assessment (VQA) models, with an\nemphasis on eliminating reliance on model ensembles, redundant weights, and\nother computationally expensive components in the previous IQA/VQA\ncompetitions. Track 2 introduces a new short-form UGC dataset tailored for\nsingle image super-resolution, i.e., the KwaiSR dataset. It consists of 1,800\nsynthetically generated S-UGC image pairs and 1,900 real-world S-UGC images,\nwhich are split into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of\n8:1:1. The primary objective of the challenge is to drive research that\nbenefits the user experience of short-form UGC platforms such as Kwai and\nTikTok. This challenge attracted 266 participants and received 18 valid final\nsubmissions with corresponding fact sheets, significantly contributing to the\nprogress of short-form UGC VQA and image superresolution.

While prior research combining visual and tactile\n(visuotactile) information has shown promise, these approaches often struggle\nwith generalization due to the limited availability of visuotactile data. In\nthis paper, we introduce ViTa-Zero, a zero-shot visuotactile pose estimation\nframework. Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone\nand performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on\nphysical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.\nSpecifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,\nwhere tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates\nrepulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world\nrobot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual\nbackbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and\nbimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some\ndrastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our\nexperiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and\n60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose."}
