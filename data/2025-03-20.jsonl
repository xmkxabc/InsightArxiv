Automatic emotion\nrecognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to\nrecognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text,\nimages, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many\nfactors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its\nappearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for\nemotion recognition. To address this, employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)\nmethods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto\nEncoders (VAEs), offers potential solutions, though these methods are often\ncomplex. This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network\n(NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and\ngeneration speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, the NGN fits the\nneurons or gas particles on body joints. Generated gas particles, which form\nthe skeletal structure later on, will be used to synthesize the new body\nposture. By attaching body postures over frames, the final synthetic body\nmotion appears. We compared our generated dataset against others generated by\nGANs, VAEs, and another benchmark algorithm, using benchmark metrics such as\nFr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and a few more.

However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges,\nand the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the\nedge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete,\nand compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We\nrepresent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined\nby attributes including control points, scales, and opacity.

Many previous works focus on effectively aligning\nthe embeddings of the new model with those of the old one to enhance the\nbackward-compatibility. Nevertheless, such strong alignment constraints would\ncompromise the discriminative ability of the new model, particularly when\ndifferent classes are closely clustered and hard to distinguish in the old\nfeature space. To address this issue, we propose to relax the constraints by\nintroducing perturbations to the old feature prototypes. This allows us to\nalign the new feature space with a pseudo-old feature space defined by these\nperturbed prototypes, thereby preserving the discriminative ability of the new\nmodel in backward-compatible learning. We have developed two approaches for\ncalculating the perturbations: Neighbor-Driven Prototype Perturbation (NDPP)\nand Optimization-Driven Prototype Perturbation (ODPP). Particularly, they take\ninto account the feature distributions of not only the old but also the new\nmodels to obtain proper perturbations along with new model updating. Extensive\nexperiments on the landmark and commodity datasets demonstrate that our\napproaches perform favorably against state-of-the-art BCL algorithms."}

The quality of videos is constantly\nincreasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution. However, optical\nflow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to\nlarge inputs due to their rigid architectures. They adopt downscaling or input\ntiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global\ninformation. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the\nactual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous\nworks only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked\nsamples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We\npropose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing\nup to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples. We\nalso introduce Kubric-NK, a new benchmark for evaluating optical flow methods\nwith input resolutions ranging from 1K to 8K. Our high-resolution evaluation\npushes the boundaries of existing methods and reveals new insights about their\ngeneralization capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that DPFlow\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2015, Spring, and\nother high-resolution benchmarks."}

To\nthis end, our solution, DG2CD-Net, aims to construct a domain-independent,\ndiscriminative embedding space for GCD. The core innovation is an episodic\ntraining strategy that enhances cross-domain generalization by adapting a base\nmodel on tasks derived from source and synthetic domains generated by a\nfoundation model. Each episode focuses on a cross-domain GCD task, diversifying\ntask setups over episodes and combining open-set domain adaptation with a novel\nmargin loss and representation learning for optimizing the feature space\nprogressively. To capture the effects of fine-tuning on the base model, we\nextend task arithmetic by adaptively weighting the local task vectors\nconcerning the fine-tuned models based on their GCD performance on a validation\ndistribution. This episodic update mechanism boosts the adaptability of the\nbase model to unseen targets.

Addressing that, we introduce a unique 3D positional information\nembedded voxel optimization mechanism to fuse multi-view features. To\nprioritize neural field reconstruction in object regions, we also devise a\ndouble importance sampling scheme for the NeRF branch of our detector. We\nadditionally propose an opacity optimization module for precise voxel opacity\nprediction by enforcing multi-view consistency constraints. Moreover, to\nfurther improve voxel density consistency across multiple perspectives, we\nincorporate ray distance as a weighting factor to minimize cumulative ray\nerrors. Our unique modules synergetically form an end-to-end neural model that\nestablishes new state-of-the-art in NeRF-based multi-view 3D detection,\nverified with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKITScenes.

Deep CNNs and\nvision-transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated individually promising initial\nperformance.

This study introduces a novel hybrid\nframework, CB-Res-RBCMT, combining customized residual CNNs and new ViT\ncomponents for detailed BUSI cancer analysis. The proposed RBCMT uses stem\nconvolution blocks with CNN Meet Transformer (CMT) blocks, followed by new\nRegional and boundary (RB) feature extraction operations for capturing contrast\nand morphological variations. Moreover, the CMT block incorporates global\ncontextual interactions through multi-head attention, enhancing computational\nefficiency with a lightweight design. Additionally, the customized inverse\nresidual and stem CNNs within the CMT effectively extract local texture\ninformation and handle vanishing gradients. Finally, the new channel-boosted\n(CB) strategy enriches the feature diversity of the limited dataset by\ncombining the original RBCMT channels with transfer learning-based residual\nCNN-generated maps. These diverse channels are processed through a spatial\nattention block for optimal pixel selection, reducing redundancy and improving\nthe discrimination of minor contrast and texture variations. The proposed\nCB-Res-RBCMT achieves an F1-score of 95.57%, accuracy of 95.63%, sensitivity of\n96.42%, and precision of 94.79% on the standard harmonized stringent BUSI\ndataset, outperforming existing ViT and CNN methods.

Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while\nspiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their\nstructural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from\ngas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic\nlight, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN\nemission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has\nbeen discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength\nobservations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO\nfrom a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the\nmachine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday\nobjects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we\ncreated a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any\nsource pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light\ndistributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We\ncondition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the\ncentral few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the\ndiffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that\ndeviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few\ncentral pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using\nVIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN\nand QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.\n[abridged]"}

When\nintegrating new data streams or onboarding new clients, this approach\nefficiently reuses previous client models, avoiding the need to retrain the\nglobal model across the entire federation. By minimizing communication load and\nbypassing the need to put unchanged clients online, our approach relaxes\nsynchronization requirements among clients, providing an efficient and scalable\nfederated analysis framework suited for real-world applications. Using\nmulti-class 3D abdominal CT segmentation as an application task, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Automatic emotion\nrecognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to\nrecognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text,\nimages, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many\nfactors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its\nappearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for\nemotion recognition.

This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network\n(NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and\ngeneration speed.

To\naddress this, we introduce a self-attention matching module that dynamically\nprioritizes relevant body parts in a data-driven manner. Given the lack of\ncorresponding labels in existing skeleton data, we establish MASD, a new HAR\ndataset with IMU, WiFi, and skeleton, collected from 20 subjects performing 27\nactivities. This is the first broadly applicable HAR dataset with\ntime-synchronized data across three modalities.

In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction\nfrom calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D\nedge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the\npoint set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges,\nand the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the\nedge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete,\nand compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We\nrepresent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined\nby attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During edge\nreconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches\nand rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image\nerror with respect to the input 2D edge images can be back-propagated to\noptimize the sketch attributes.

Many previous works focus on effectively aligning\nthe embeddings of the new model with those of the old one to enhance the\nbackward-compatibility. Nevertheless, such strong alignment constraints would\ncompromise the discriminative ability of the new model, particularly when\ndifferent classes are closely clustered and hard to distinguish in the old\nfeature space.

The quality of videos is constantly\nincreasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution.

They adopt downscaling or input\ntiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global\ninformation. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the\nactual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous\nworks only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked\nsamples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We\npropose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing\nup to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples.

To\nthis end, our solution, DG2CD-Net, aims to construct a domain-independent,\ndiscriminative embedding space for GCD. The core innovation is an episodic\ntraining strategy that enhances cross-domain generalization by adapting a base\nmodel on tasks derived from source and synthetic domains generated by a\nfoundation model.

Many\nstudies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a\nsingle position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions\nachieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is\nchosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality.\nRecently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard\nattention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show\nthat this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case,\nthey correspond to a \\emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we\nshow that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \\emph{soft}\nattention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than\nright-attention models.

The scales of camera positions in\nthis monocular setting are ambiguous. Previous methods have acknowledged scale\nambiguity in multi-view data via various ad-hoc normalization pre-processing\nsteps, but have not directly analyzed the effect of incorrect scene scales on\ntheir application. In this paper, we seek to understand and address the effect\nof scale ambiguity when used to train generative novel view synthesis methods\n(GNVS). In GNVS, new views of a scene or object can be minimally synthesized\ngiven a single image and are, thus, unconstrained, necessitating the use of\ngenerative methods. The generative nature of these models captures all aspects\nof uncertainty, including any uncertainty of scene scales, which act as\nnuisance variables for the task. We study the effect of scene scale ambiguity\nin GNVS when sampled from a single image by isolating its effect on the\nresulting models and, based on these intuitions, define new metrics that\nmeasure the scale inconsistency of generated views. We then propose a framework\nto estimate scene scales jointly with the GNVS model in an end-to-end fashion.\nEmpirically, we show that our method reduces the scale inconsistency of\ngenerated views without the complexity or downsides of previous scale\nnormalization methods. Further, we show that removing this ambiguity improves\ngenerated image quality of the resulting GNVS model."}

The\nanalysis used the Cellpose 3 model for segmentation and Attention-based Deep\nMultiple Instance Learning for classification. Our model achieved an accuracy\nof 77.15% for bacteria and 71.39% for fungi, with ROC AUC of 0.97 and 0.88,\nrespectively. The highest values, reaching up to 96.2%, were obtained for\nCutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and\nNakaseomyces glabratus. Classification difficulties were observed in closely\nrelated species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus\nhaemolyticus, due to morphological similarity, and within Candida albicans due\nto high morphotic diversity.\n  The study confirms the potential of our model for microbial classification,\nbut it also indicates the need for further optimisation and expansion of the\ntraining data set. In the future, this technology could support microbial\ndiagnosis, reducing diagnostic time and improving the effectiveness of sepsis\ntreatment due to its simplicity and accessibility. Part of the results\npresented in this publication was covered by a patent application at the\nEuropean Patent Office EP24461637.1 \"A computer implemented method for\nidentifying a microorganism in a blood and a data processing system therefor\"."}

Deep CNNs and\nvision-transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated individually promising initial\nperformance.

This study introduces a novel hybrid\nframework, CB-Res-RBCMT, combining customized residual CNNs and new ViT\ncomponents for detailed BUSI cancer analysis. The proposed RBCMT uses stem\nconvolution blocks with CNN Meet Transformer (CMT) blocks, followed by new\nRegional and boundary (RB) feature extraction operations for capturing contrast\nand morphological variations. Moreover, the CMT block incorporates global\ncontextual interactions through multi-head attention, enhancing computational\nefficiency with a lightweight design. Additionally, the customized inverse\nresidual and stem CNNs within the CMT effectively extract local texture\ninformation and handle vanishing gradients. Finally, the new channel-boosted\n(CB) strategy enriches the feature diversity of the limited dataset by\ncombining the original RBCMT channels with transfer learning-based residual\nCNN-generated maps. These diverse channels are processed through a spatial\nattention block for optimal pixel selection, reducing redundancy and improving\nthe discrimination of minor contrast and texture variations. The proposed\nCB-Res-RBCMT achieves an F1-score of 95.57%, accuracy of 95.63%, sensitivity of\n96.42%, and precision of 94.79% on the standard harmonized stringent BUSI\ndataset, outperforming existing ViT and CNN methods.

Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while\nspiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their\nstructural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from\ngas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic\nlight, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN\nemission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has\nbeen discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength\nobservations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO\nfrom a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the\nmachine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday\nobjects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we\ncreated a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any\nsource pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light\ndistributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We\ncondition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the\ncentral few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the\ndiffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that\ndeviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few\ncentral pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using\nVIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN\nand QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.\n[abridged]"}

Alison Noble"], "title": "Federated Continual 3D Segmentation With Single-round Communication", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Federated learning seeks to foster collaboration among distributed clients\nwhile preserving the privacy of their local data. Traditionally, federated\nlearning methods assume a fixed setting in which client data and learning\nobjectives remain constant. However, in real-world scenarios, new clients may\njoin, and existing clients may expand the segmentation label set as task\nrequirements evolve. In such a dynamic federated analysis setup, the\nconventional federated communication strategy of model aggregation per\ncommunication round is suboptimal. As new clients join, this strategy requires\nretraining, linearly increasing communication and computation overhead. It also\nimposes requirements for synchronized communication, which is difficult to\nachieve among distributed clients. In this paper, we propose a federated\ncontinual learning strategy that employs a one-time model aggregation at the\nserver through multi-model distillation. This approach builds and updates the\nglobal model while eliminating the need for frequent server communication. When\nintegrating new data streams or onboarding new clients, this approach\nefficiently reuses previous client models, avoiding the need to retrain the\nglobal model across the entire federation. By minimizing communication load and\nbypassing the need to put unchanged clients online, our approach relaxes\nsynchronization requirements among clients, providing an efficient and scalable\nfederated analysis framework suited for real-world applications. Using\nmulti-class 3D abdominal CT segmentation as an application task, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Conventional deep\nlearning models are typically modality-dependent, often requiring custom\narchitectures and objectives for different types of signals. However, existing\nINR frameworks frequently rely on global latent vectors or exhibit\ncomputational inefficiencies that limit their broader applicability. We\nintroduce LIFT, a novel, high-performance framework that addresses these\nchallenges by capturing multiscale information through meta-learning. LIFT\nleverages multiple parallel localized implicit functions alongside a\nhierarchical latent generator to produce unified latent representations that\nspan local, intermediate, and global features. This architecture facilitates\nsmooth transitions across local regions, enhancing expressivity while\nmaintaining inference efficiency. Additionally, we introduce ReLIFT, an\nenhanced variant of LIFT that incorporates residual connections and expressive\nfrequency encodings. With this straightforward approach, ReLIFT effectively\naddresses the convergence-capacity gap found in comparable methods, providing\nan efficient yet powerful solution to improve capacity and speed up\nconvergence. Empirical results show that LIFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance in generative modeling and classification tasks, with notable\nreductions in computational costs. Moreover, in single-task settings, the\nstreamlined ReLIFT architecture proves effective in signal representations and\ninverse problem tasks."}
