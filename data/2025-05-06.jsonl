However, current customization methods face\nseveral limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone;\n2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or\nconfusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent\nbackgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a\ntuning-free method that enables high-quality image customization using both\ntext and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key\noperations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel\ndiffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows\nMCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while\nmaintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to\nmitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual\nscenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise\nsubject and editable image layers based on user instructions. Extensive\nquantitative and human evaluation experiments show that MCA-Ctrl outperforms\nexisting methods in zero-shot image customization, effectively resolving the\nmentioned issues."}

These scores are competitive with the best published results on\nthis dataset, and do not require any technically sophisticated model training,\nfine-tuning or few-shot prompting. To ensure that these strong results are not\ndue to memorization of judicial opinions contained in the training data, we\ndevelop and utilize a novel citation anonymization test that preserves semantic\nmeaning while ensuring case names and citations are fictitious.

This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework\ncalled HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and\nstandardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and\nexplicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to\nsupervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a\ncanonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form\nstandard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is\nproposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current\nstage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality\nduring generation. But experiment results show that it still provides\ncomparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with\nevidently higher encoding and decoding speed.

To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should\nstimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a\nscore or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores\nor directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle\nto integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability.\nInspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on\nreasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating\nreasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's\ninterpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of\ngenerative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which\nformulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented\ntraining pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists\nof two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2)\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by\nself-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating\ncandidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve\nstate-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across\nmultiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger\nopen-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by\nup to 13.8%.

However, their\napplication to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies\nin schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,\nand limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper\nintroduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output\nTransformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven\ntransformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic\nalignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight\nschema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic\ncontext construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile\nof the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured\nprompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable\noutputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates\na refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based\non execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches\nthat rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a\nreasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of\nadjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is\na robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with\nLLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where\ninterpretability, stability, and correctness are essential."}

This\ncollaborative integration endows our network with more comprehensive and\ndiscriminative information, substantially improving the accuracy and stability\nof pose estimation. A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is\ndesigned, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression\nor heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we\nincorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a\nrelationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further\nstrengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets. The results\nindicate that our method is significantly superior to previous state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods and remarkably boosts the recognition ability of fingerprint\nrecognition algorithms.

Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities,\nleading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this\nproblem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP\nChallenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose\nsolution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not\nstraightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities\ndrastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these\nambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first\nlearns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's\nsurface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation\nenables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D\ncorrespondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution\nusing PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex\nnon-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art\nsolutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from\nan RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches."}

Enhanced by the reciprocal transformation of\ntask outputs, our approach integrates additional regression supervision within\nthe segmentation context, bolstering the model's generalization ability from a\ndual-task perspective. Besides, dual self-supervised learning in feature spaces\nand output spaces augments the model's representational capability and\nstability across different imaging views.

This paper presents a machine learning approach for\napproximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse\nellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate\nsurface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points\nconstructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately\nwith as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e.,\nrepresent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and\napproximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is\nintroduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly\noptimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve\ncomputational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed,\nrestricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center.\nThe computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which\nsignificantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical\noctree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the\ninitialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using\ncoarse grid points in the octree lattice structure.
