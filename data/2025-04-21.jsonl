However,\nBlau and Michaeli [5] introduced a generalized framework, known as the\nrate-distortion-perception (RDP) function, incorporating perceptual quality as\nan additional dimension of evaluation. More recently, the\nrate-distortion-classification (RDC) function was investigated in [19],\nevaluating compression performance by considering classification accuracy\nalongside distortion. In this paper, we explore universal representations,\nwhere a single encoder is developed to achieve multiple decoding objectives\nacross various distortion and classification (or perception) constraints. This\nuniversality avoids retraining encoders for each specific operating point\nwithin these tradeoffs. Our experimental validation on the MNIST dataset\nindicates that a universal encoder incurs only minimal performance degradation\ncompared to individually optimized encoders for perceptual image compression\ntasks, aligning with prior results from [23]. Nonetheless, we also identify\nthat in the RDC setting, reusing an encoder optimized for one specific\nclassification-distortion tradeoff leads to a significant distortion penalty\nwhen applied to alternative points."}

To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic\nmodel with accurate lip-sync.

Yet,\nexisting works focus mainly on investigating the sensitivity of LLMs to\nirrelevant context and overlook the importance of key information. In this\npaper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs, i.e. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini,\nClaude3 and LLaMA2-7b, to key medical information by introducing different\nperturbation strategies. The evaluation results highlight the limitations of\ncurrent LLMs in remaining sensitive to key medical information for diagnostic\ndecision-making. The evolution of LLMs must focus on improving their\nreliability, enhancing their ability to be sensitive to key information, and\neffectively utilizing this information.

FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional\nmappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher\nresolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it\nsusceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid\nstructure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in\nperformance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings\nthrough the lens of an analogous kernel regression.

Based on this framework, we propose calibrated reannotation\nto tackle the misalignment between the annotated confidence score and the\nmixing ratio during the diffusion reverse process.

The CHBC framework extracts discriminative features across various\nhierarchies using a specially designed module to decompose and enhance\nattention masks and features. We employ bidirectional consistency loss to\nregulate the classification outcomes across different hierarchies, ensuring\nlabel prediction consistency and reducing misclassification. Experiments on\nthree widely used FGVC datasets validate the effectiveness of the CHBC\nframework. Ablation studies further investigate the application strategies of\nfeature enhancement and consistency constraints, underscoring the significant\ncontributions of the proposed modules."}

First, we assess neural networks' visualization\ntechniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for\nbreast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI\nand causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past\nand future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the\ncausality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature\nco-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable\npredictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that\nintegrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and\nprior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological\nvision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a\nconnectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall,\nour key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for\nmedical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and\nradiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak\ncausal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve\nperformance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical\ndomains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit\nmotifs improves human-aligned recognition.

By leveraging latent space representations\nand reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves\nsignificantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based\nsuper-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To\nprevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption,\nensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during\ntraining. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach\noutperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency\nand image quality. This work bridges the performance gap between diffusion- and\nGAN-based methods, laying the foundation for real-time applications of\ndiffusion models in high-resolution image generation."}

The framework proposes two novel modules: 1)\na Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high\naccuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference\nTrajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse\ntrajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths.\nEvaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over\nexisting methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction\n(-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits\nexceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an\nentry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps.

This paper proposes Gaussian\nsplatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and\nmakes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS\nmodel which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic\nview from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image\nuploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual\nenvironments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further\nproposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to\nupload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO\nproblem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication\nenergy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with\nAPO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM)."}

However, existing datasets fail to include the specific\nchallenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or\ngeneralization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural\nrendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&Render, a novel dataset\ndesigned to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view\nrendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot\nkinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic\ndata, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when\napplied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups\nfeaturing consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting\nconditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as\nobject rearrangements.

However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task\nof forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time\nproceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which\nmeans that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat\nthem. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a\nnovel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the\nmodel learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on\nprevious predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of\nsubsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors\nduring inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse\ndemonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up\nto 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We\nfurther showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better\nhandling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users."}

It is widely believed that\nRLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning\nabilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,\nhowever, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the\npass@\\textit{k} metric with large values of \\textit{k} to explore the reasoning\ncapability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and\nbenchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \\emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally\nnew reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at\nsmaller values of $k$ (\\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or\neven higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$\nvalues. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included\nin the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning\nabilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.\nFurther analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the\nmodel's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,\ntherefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in\na narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar\nresults are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we\nfind that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,\ndifferent from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in\nadvancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink\nthe impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.\nProject Page: https://limit-of-RLVR.github.io"}
