However,\nphysiological data characterized by cross-subject variability and noisy labels\nhinder the performance of emotion recognition models. Existing domain\nadaptation and continual learning methods struggle to address these issues,\nespecially under realistic conditions where data is continuously streamed and\nunlabeled. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel bi-level\nself-supervised continual learning framework, SSOCL, based on a dynamic memory\nbuffer. This bi-level architecture iteratively refines the dynamic buffer and\npseudo-label assignments to effectively retain representative samples, enabling\ngeneralization from continuous, unlabeled physiological data streams for\nemotion recognition. The assigned pseudo-labels are subsequently leveraged for\naccurate emotion prediction. Key components of the framework, including a fast\nadaptation module and a cluster-mapping module, enable robust learning and\neffective handling of evolving data streams. Experimental validation on two\nmainstream EEG tasks demonstrates the framework's ability to adapt to\ncontinuous data streams while maintaining strong generalization across\nsubjects, outperforming existing approaches."}

Although foundation\nmodels (FMs) have recently demonstrated impressive generalizability and\ntransfer learning capabilities by leveraging vast and diverse datasets, their\nperformance can be undermined by spurious correlations that arise from\nvariations in image quality, labeling uncertainty, and sensitive patient\nattributes. In this work, we explore the fairness and bias of FMs for breast\nmammography classification by leveraging a large pool of datasets from diverse\nsources-including data from underrepresented regions and an in-house dataset.\nOur extensive experiments show that while modality-specific pre-training of FMs\nenhances performance, classifiers trained on features from individual datasets\nfail to generalize across domains. Aggregating datasets improves overall\nperformance, yet does not fully mitigate biases, leading to significant\ndisparities across under-represented subgroups such as extreme breast densities\nand age groups. Furthermore, while domain-adaptation strategies can reduce\nthese disparities, they often incur a performance trade-off.

Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a\nunified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a\nunified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain\nindependently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without\ninteroperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the\ndevelopment of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we\npropose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake\nimage detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset,\nmodel, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the\nscarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks\nin some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven\narchitecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components\nacross datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible\ncomposition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6\nbackbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing\nbenchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii)\nconducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable\ninsights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation\nstandards.

We\nhypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more\nconcise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy\nOptimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum\nlength over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO\nemploys a novel length reward function based on this history state to\nincentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those\npreviously found.

Furthermore, we propose Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an\neffective self-improvement method that enhances performance by leveraging the\nmodel's own capabilities without requiring external data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GPO is effective across various diffusion models and tasks.\nSpecifically, combining with widely used computer vision models, such as YOLO\nand OCR, the GPO improves the accurate counting and text rendering capabilities\nof the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium by 20 percentage points.

Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the\ninstruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary\nfocus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been\nincreasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented\nguidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines\nexhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of\ndomain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates.

In this paper,\nwe introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate\nguideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three\ncritical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule\nupdates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences.

However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model\nas the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may\ncauses significant performance degradation, especially when the compression\nrate is extremely high.

To solve this problem, we\npropose PSDiffusion, a unified diffusion framework for simultaneous multi-layer\ntext-to-image generation. Our model can automatically generate multi-layer\nimages with one RGB background and multiple RGBA foregrounds through a single\nfeed-forward process. Unlike existing methods that combine multiple tools for\npost-decomposition or generate layers sequentially and separately, our method\nintroduces a global-layer interactive mechanism that generates layered-images\nconcurrently and collaboratively, ensuring not only high quality and\ncompleteness for each layer, but also spatial and visual interactions among\nlayers for global coherence."}
