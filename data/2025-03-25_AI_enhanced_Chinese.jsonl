With the growing number of long documents,\ndialogues, and other textual data, it is important to develop Long Context\nLanguage Models (LCLMs) that can process and analyze extensive inputs in an\neffective and efficient way. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey\non recent advances in long-context modeling for large language models. Our\nsurvey is structured around three key aspects: how to obtain effective and\nefficient LCLMs, how to train and deploy LCLMs efficiently, and how to evaluate\nand analyze LCLMs comprehensively. For the first aspect, we discuss data\nstrategies, architectural designs, and workflow approaches oriented with long\ncontext processing. For the second aspect, we provide a detailed examination of\nthe infrastructure required for LCLM training and inference. For the third\naspect, we present evaluation paradigms for long-context comprehension and\nlong-form generation, as well as behavioral analysis and mechanism\ninterpretability of LCLMs. Beyond these three key aspects, we thoroughly\nexplore the diverse application scenarios where existing LCLMs have been\ndeployed and outline promising future development directions.

To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs\n(MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing\nvision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends\nMLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two\nbenchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the\noverall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any\nmodality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG\ncapabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries\ncurated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates\nthe judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from\nthe perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a\nstandardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics.\nOur extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in\nassessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting\nand 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges\nwith MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and\n30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and\nhallucination issues.

However, due to the huge\ndata volume and unstructured geometry, efficient compression of point clouds is\nvery crucial. The Moving Picture Expert Group is establishing a geometry-based\npoint cloud compression (G-PCC) standard for both static and dynamic point\nclouds in recent years. Although lossy compression of G-PCC can achieve a very\nhigh compression ratio, the reconstruction quality is relatively low,\nespecially at low bitrates. To mitigate this problem, we propose a high\nefficiency Wiener filter that can be integrated into the encoder and decoder\npipeline of G-PCC to improve the reconstruction quality as well as the\nrate-distortion performance for dynamic point clouds. Specifically, we first\npropose a basic Wiener filter, and then improve it by introducing coefficients\ninheritance and variance-based point classification for the Luma component.\nBesides, to reduce the complexity of the nearest neighbor search during the\napplication of the Wiener filter, we also propose a Morton code-based fast\nnearest neighbor search algorithm for efficient calculation of filter\ncoefficients.

To do\nso successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world\nand form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user\nwith personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually\ninfer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To\nevaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian\ninference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to\nupdate an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that\nthe LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework,\nand that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more\ninformation becomes available, even less so than we find is the case for\nhumans. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner\nby training them to mimic the predictions of an optimal Bayesian model. We find\nthat this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the\nparticular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables\ngeneralization to other tasks. This suggests that this method endows the LLM\nwith broader Bayesian reasoning skills.

Using the\nReddit Meme Dataset and Memotion Dataset, we extract low-level visual features\nand high-level semantic features to identify similar meme pairs.

Lower\nthresholds retain finer details but introduce pervasive noise, whereas higher\nthresholds suppress extraneous activations at the expense of crucial object\ninformation. To mitigate these constraints, we introduce the Event-Based\nCrossing Dataset (EBCD), a comprehensive dataset tailored for pedestrian and\nvehicle detection in dynamic outdoor environments, incorporating a\nmulti-thresholding framework to refine event representations. By capturing\nevent-based images at ten distinct threshold levels (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40,\n50, 60, and 75), this dataset facilitates an extensive assessment of object\ndetection performance under varying conditions of sparsity and noise\nsuppression.

Alternative methods break long\nvideos down into sequential generation of short video segments, requiring\nmultiple sampling chain iterations and specialized consistency modules. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce a new paradigm called Video Interface\nNetworks (VINs), which augment DiTs with an abstraction module to enable\nparallel inference of video chunks. At each diffusion step, VINs encode global\nsemantics from the noisy input of local chunks and the encoded representations,\nin turn, guide DiTs in denoising chunks in parallel. The coupling of VIN and\nDiT is learned end-to-end on the denoising objective. Further, the VIN\narchitecture maintains fixed-size encoding tokens that encode the input via a\nsingle cross-attention step.

Although motion\ngeneration has been extensively studied, most methods do not support ``embodied\nintelligence'' due to their offline setting, slow speed, limited motion\nlengths, or unnatural movements. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nPRIMAL, an autoregressive diffusion model that is learned with a two-stage\nparadigm, inspired by recent advances in foundation models. In the pretraining\nstage, the model learns motion dynamics from a large number of sub-second\nmotion segments, providing ``motor primitives'' from which more complex motions\nare built. In the adaptation phase, we employ a ControlNet-like adaptor to\nfine-tune the motor control for semantic action generation and spatial target\nreaching. Experiments show that physics effects emerge from our training. Given\na single-frame initial state, our model not only generates unbounded,\nrealistic, and controllable motion, but also enables the avatar to be\nresponsive to induced impulses in real time. In addition, we can effectively\nand efficiently adapt our base model to few-shot personalized actions and the\ntask of spatial control. Evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. We leverage the model to create a real-time\ncharacter animation system in Unreal Engine that is highly responsive and\nnatural.

Recently, a point-supervised paradigm has been\npresented to address this task, requiring only a single annotated frame within\nthe target moment rather than complete temporal boundaries. Compared with the\nfully-supervised paradigm, it offers a balance between localization accuracy\nand annotation cost. However, due to the absence of complete annotation, it is\nchallenging to align the video content with language descriptions, consequently\nhindering accurate moment prediction. To address this problem, we propose a new\nCOllaborative Temporal consistEncy Learning (COTEL) framework that leverages\nthe synergy between saliency detection and moment localization to strengthen\nthe video-language alignment. Specifically, we first design a frame- and a\nsegment-level Temporal Consistency Learning (TCL) module that models semantic\nalignment across frame saliencies and sentence-moment pairs. Then, we design a\ncross-consistency guidance scheme, including a Frame-level Consistency Guidance\n(FCG) and a Segment-level Consistency Guidance (SCG), that enables the two\ntemporal consistency learning paths to reinforce each other mutually. Further,\nwe introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment Loss (HCAL) to\ncomprehensively align the video and text query.

Experiments on\nthe LaMP benchmark show that PriME outperforms both prompt-based and\ntraining-based methods, achieving up to a 45% performance improvement over the\nprior art. Further analysis shows that PriME achieves a significantly better\nprivacy-utility trade-off, highlighting the potential of evolutionary\napproaches for privacy-preserving LLM personalization.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PriME\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u5728LaMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPriME\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534745%\uff0c\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684LLM\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose a multi-model\nframework employing up to three lightweight worker models and a single, more\nrobust judge model analogous to draft models and target model, respectively, in\nspeculative decoding. The worker models, tasked with the bulk of the\ncomputation, independently predict discrete class labels for a given input.\nWhen majority worker models agree on a label, it is accepted as the final\nlabel, optimizing efficiency by bypassing the computationally expensive judge\nmodel. In cases of disagreement, the judge model intervenes to resolve the\nlabel. This approach minimizes redundant computation, leverages the redundancy\nof multiple workers for confidence, and confines the judge model's role to\nchallenging cases, offering a practical balance of efficiency and accuracy.

Accepted by TPAMI", "summary": "Open set recognition (OSR) requires models to classify known samples while\ndetecting unknown samples for real-world applications. Existing studies show\nimpressive progress using unknown samples from auxiliary datasets to regularize\nOSR models, but they have proved to be sensitive to selecting such known\noutliers. In this paper, we discuss the aforementioned problem from a new\nperspective: Can we regularize OSR models without elaborately selecting\nauxiliary known outliers? We first empirically and theoretically explore the\nrole of foregrounds and backgrounds in open set recognition and disclose that:\n1) backgrounds that correlate with foregrounds would mislead the model and\ncause failures when encounters 'partially' known images; 2) Backgrounds\nunrelated to foregrounds can serve as auxiliary known outliers and provide\nregularization via global average pooling. Based on the above insights, we\npropose a new method, Background Mix (BackMix), that mixes the foreground of an\nimage with different backgrounds to remove the underlying fore-background\npriors. Specifically, BackMix first estimates the foreground with class\nactivation maps (CAMs), then randomly replaces image patches with backgrounds\nfrom other images to obtain mixed images for training. With backgrounds\nde-correlated from foregrounds, the open set recognition performance is\nsignificantly improved.

This paper presents part\nof our ongoing research work to bridge some of these gaps for the Somali\nlanguage.

However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two\nkey abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where\nbackdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even\nwith significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency,\nwhere the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the\ncross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for\ndefenders, making backdoors easier to identify. To enhance the stealthiness of\nbackdoor samples, we propose a novel Invisible Backdoor Attack (IBA) by\nexplicitly mitigating these consistencies.

In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to\ntheir significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current\nsemi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or\nconsider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames,\noften overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous\ndriving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such\nas roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects\nexhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is\nalso captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby\nobjects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these\ncharacteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and\nlow-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames. These\nrepresentations are further enhanced and fused using a cross-attention\nmechanism. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student framework to align the\nrepresentations learned by the labeled and unlabeled branches, effectively\nutilizing the large amounts of unlabeled data.

However, it faces challenges\nsuch as understanding instrument-action relationships and tracking surgical\nprogress. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in understanding surgical\nvideo content but remain underexplored for predictive decision-making in SAP,\nas they focus mainly on retrospective analysis.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLM-SAP, a\nLarge Language Models-based Surgical Action Planning framework that predicts\nfuture actions and generates text responses by interpreting natural language\nprompts of surgical goals. The text responses potentially support surgical\neducation, intraoperative decision-making, procedure documentation, and skill\nanalysis. LLM-SAP integrates two novel modules: the Near-History Focus Memory\nModule (NHF-MM) for modeling historical states and the prompts factory for\naction planning. We evaluate LLM-SAP on our constructed CholecT50-SAP dataset\nusing models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen2-VL, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nnext-action prediction. Pre-trained LLMs are tested zero-shot, and supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA is implemented to address data privacy concerns.\nOur experiments show that Qwen2.5-72B-SFT surpasses Qwen2.5-72B with a 19.3%\nhigher accuracy.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u624b\u672f\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff08LLM-SAP\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u672f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\uff08SAP\uff09\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u672f\u4e2d\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u5177-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u624b\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "LLM-SAP\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8fd1\u5386\u53f2\u805a\u7126\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff08NHF-MM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5386\u53f2\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u5382\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen2.5\u548cQwen2-VL\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548cLoRA\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728CholecT50-SAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cQwen2.5-72B-SFT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4Qwen2.5-72B\u9ad8\u51fa19.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM-SAP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u624b\u672f\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u624b\u672f\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u672f\u4e2d\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u6587\u6863\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

For years, image coding focused on human perception\nhas been well-studied, leading to the development of various image compression\nstandards. On the other hand, with the rapid advancements in image recognition\nmodels, image compression for AI tasks, known as Image Coding for Machines\n(ICM), has gained significant importance. Therefore, scalable image coding\ntechniques that address the needs of both machines and humans have become a key\narea of interest. Additionally, there is increasing demand for research\napplying the diffusion model, which can generate human-viewable images from a\nsmall amount of data to image compression methods for human vision. Image\ncompression methods that use diffusion models can partially reconstruct the\ntarget image by guiding the generation process with a small amount of\nconditioning information. Inspired by the diffusion model's potential, we\npropose a method for extending machine vision to human visual perception using\nguided diffusion.

Objective: The study aims to perform a systematic\nreview to comprehensively assess and analyze the state-of-the-art NLP methods\nfor the mainland Scandinavian clinical text. Method: A literature search was\nconducted in various online databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google\nScholar, ACM digital library, and IEEE Xplore between December 2022 and\nFebruary 2024. Further, relevant references to the included articles were also\nused to solidify our search. The final pool includes articles that conducted\nclinical NLP in the mainland Scandinavian languages and were published in\nEnglish between 2010 and 2024. Results: Out of the 113 articles, 18% (n=21)\nfocus on Norwegian clinical text, 64% (n=72) on Swedish, 10% (n=11) on Danish,\nand 8% (n=9) focus on more than one language.

Additionally, we employ\nthe Kendall Tau distance as an evaluation metric for the SSO task and propose\nthe Kendall Tau Distance-Cross Entropy Loss. We further introduce the concept\nof Cinematology Embedding, which incorporates movie metadata and shot labels as\nprior knowledge into the SSO model, and constructs the AVE-Meta dataset to\nvalidate the method's effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the\nproposed loss function and method substantially enhance SSO task accuracy.

It implements a multi-agent\nsystem consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter\nlanguage model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter\nagent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language\nmodel but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These\nexperiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract\ngrammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in\nthe input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete\ngrammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical\nknowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical\nagglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively\ngenerated by the mother language model.

Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from\nmultiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either\nrequire expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine\nsimilarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find\nthat the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple\nlayers of the KV-Cache.

Through\nextensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs\n(e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates\nthan state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%.\nMoreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)\n(e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding\ntasks without performance degradation.

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or\nweb-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the\nsimulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data\noften requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a\nRewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates\nthe unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training\ndata. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can\nbe obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote\ngeneralization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation\nRewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling\nobservation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via\nText-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast\nInstruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten\ninstructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and\nnew observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy\nwith a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data\ndistribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during\ntraining.

We evaluated DOLA\nusing a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in\n20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and\noptimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations.\nThe 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving\napproximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach\noutperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated\nconvergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and\nreinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified\n0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This\nproof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally\nhosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a\ncommercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction\nthrough interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and\nprivacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical\nimplementation and workflow improvement.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406DOLA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u5236\u5b9a\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u60a3\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLaMa3.1 LLM\u4e0e\u5546\u4e1a\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u3002", "result": "70B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e8B\u6a21\u578b\uff0cRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534719.8%\uff0cRL\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "DOLA\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u672c\u5730LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, methods have\nbeen proposed for 3D scene understanding based on Gaussian splatting.

To streamline the pipeline and achieve\nglobal optimization, we propose PanopticSplatting, an end-to-end system for\nopen-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction.

The local cross attention\nwithin view frustum effectively reduces the training memory, making our model\nmore accessible to large scenes with more Gaussians and objects. In addition,\nto address the challenge of noisy labels in 2D pseudo masks, we propose label\nblending to promote consistent 3D segmentation with less noisy floaters, as\nwell as label warping on 2D predictions which enhances multi-view coherence and\nsegmentation accuracy. Our method demonstrates strong performances in 3D scene\npanoptic reconstruction on the ScanNet-V2 and ScanNet++ datasets, compared with\nboth NeRF-based and Gaussian-based panoptic reconstruction methods.

Specifically, we utilize\nMLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text\nembeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text\nembeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial\nconsistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects\nthat do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D\nmodel with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address\nthis, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation\nmasks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of\nthe scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal\nsemantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object\nacross different views.

We then introduce a two-stage\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy to enhance the LLM's motion comprehension\nwith pathology-specific knowledge. This strategy includes: 1) a generative\nstage that aligns gait motions with analytic descriptions through bidirectional\nmotion-description generation, 2) a reasoning stage that integrates logical\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for impairment assessment with UPDRS gait\nscore. Validation on an existing dataset and comparisons with state-of-the-art\nmethods confirm the robustness and accuracy of our pipeline, demonstrating its\nability to assign gait impairment scores from motion input with clinically\nmeaningful rationales.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAGIR\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VQ-VAE\u8fd0\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6b65\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAGIR\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u62ecVQ-VAE\u8fd0\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u548cLLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660eAGIR\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u6b65\u6001\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "AGIR\u4e3a\u6b65\u6001\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We argue that there exists a substantial writing\nmanner gap between the visual instructions and the base Large Language Models\n(LLMs) within LMMs. This gap forces the pre-trained base LLMs to deviate from\ntheir original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both base\nLLMs and LMMs. To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original\nsemantics, we propose directly leveraging the base LLM to align the writing\nmanner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the base LLM itself,\nresulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions.

Therefore, we further enhance the visual encoder to\nmitigate the vision encoder bottleneck under a contrastive learning framework.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly mitigates the\nperception bottleneck and improves the ability of LVLMs to comprehend charts.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/Vision4Chart.", "AI": {"task": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LVLMs\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To solve the\nproblem with a VLM, we propose a new global-local tree search algorithm.\nGlobally, the method places each object sequentially and explores multiple\nplacements during each placement process, where the problem space is\nrepresented as a tree.

Locally, we also decompose the sub-task, the placement of each object,\ninto multiple steps. The algorithm searches the tree of problem space. To\nleverage the VLM model to produce positions of objects, we discretize the\ntop-down view space as a dense grid and fill each cell with diverse emojis to\nmake to cells distinct.

The ADZUS\narchitecture is detailed, with its integration of self-attention mechanisms\nthat facilitate context-aware and detail-sensitive segmentations being\nhighlighted. Experimental results across various medical imaging datasets,\nincluding skin lesion segmentation, chest X-ray infection segmentation, and\nwhite blood cell segmentation, reveal that ADZUS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Notably, ADZUS reached Dice scores ranging from 88.7\\% to 92.9\\%\nand IoU scores from 66.3\\% to 93.3\\% across different segmentation tasks,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in handling novel, unseen medical\nimagery. It is noteworthy that while ADZUS demonstrates high effectiveness, it\ndemands substantial computational resources and extended processing times. The\nmodel's efficacy in zero-shot settings underscores its potential to reduce\nreliance on costly annotations and seamlessly adapt to new medical imaging\ntasks, thereby expanding the diagnostic capabilities of AI-driven medical\nimaging technologies.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08ADZUS\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0cDice\u5206\u657088.7%\u81f392.9%\uff0cIoU\u5206\u657066.3%\u81f393.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "ADZUS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8f83\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8AI\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While knowledge distillation is a\npromising approach for improving the performance of edge models, the\ndiscrepancy in model capacities and heterogeneous architectures between LVFMs\nand edge models poses a significant challenge. Our observation indicates that\nalthough utilizing larger backbones (e.g., ViT-S to ViT-L) in teacher models\nimproves their downstream task performances, the knowledge distillation from\nthe large teacher models fails to bring as much performance gain for student\nmodels as for teacher models due to the large model discrepancy. Our simple yet\neffective CustomKD customizes the well-generalized features inherent in LVFMs\nto a given student model in order to reduce model discrepancies. Specifically,\nbeyond providing well-generalized original knowledge from teachers, CustomKD\naligns the features of teachers to those of students, making it easy for\nstudents to understand and overcome the large model discrepancy overall.\nCustomKD significantly improves the performances of edge models in scenarios\nwith unlabeled data such as unsupervised domain adaptation (e.g., OfficeHome\nand DomainNet) and semi-supervised learning (e.g., CIFAR-100 with 400 labeled\nsamples and ImageNet with 1% labeled samples), achieving the new\nstate-of-the-art performances.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCustomKD\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVFMs\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MobileNetV3\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LVFMs\uff08\u5982DINOv2\u548cCLIP\uff09\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "CustomKD\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236LVFMs\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "CustomKD\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "CustomKD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

KV cache quantization has\nemerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even\n2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs.\nHowever, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV\ncache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and\ndequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this\nwork, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor\nCores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging\nTensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of\nKV cache generation at each decoding step.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in polyp\nsegmentation, challenges such as high computational costs, difficulty in\nsegmenting small or low-contrast polyps, and limited generalizability across\ndatasets persist. To address these issues, we propose LGPS, a lightweight\nGAN-based framework for polyp segmentation. LGPS incorporates three key\ninnovations: (1) a MobileNetV2 backbone enhanced with modified residual blocks\nand Squeeze-and-Excitation (ResE) modules for efficient feature extraction; (2)\nConvolutional Conditional Random Fields (ConvCRF) for precise boundary\nrefinement; and (3) a hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy,\nWeighted IoU Loss, and Dice Loss to address class imbalance and enhance\nsegmentation accuracy. LGPS is validated on five benchmark datasets and\ncompared with state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods. On the largest and challenging\nPolypGen test dataset, LGPS achieves a Dice of 0.7299 and an IoU of 0.7867,\noutperformed all SOTA works and demonstrating robust generalization.

Unlike existing adapter-based and prompt-tuning 3D PEFT methods, MoST\nintroduces no additional inference overhead and is compatible with many 3D\nrepresentation learning backbones. At its core, we present a new family of\nstructured matrices for 3D point clouds, Point Monarch, which can capture local\ngeometric features of irregular points while offering high expressiveness. MoST\nreparameterizes the dense update weight matrices as our sparse Point Monarch\nmatrices, significantly reducing parameters while retaining strong performance.\nExperiments on various backbones show that MoST is simple, effective, and\nhighly generalizable. It captures local features in point clouds, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, e.g., 97.5% acc. on\nScanObjectNN (PB_50_RS) and 96.2% on ModelNet40 classification, while it can\nalso combine with other matrix decompositions (e.g., Low-rank, Kronecker) to\nfurther reduce parameters.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMonarch Sparse Tuning (MoST)\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e3D\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u76843D\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Point Monarch\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c6\u66f4\u65b0\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u7684Point Monarch\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "MoST\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982ScanObjectNN (PB_50_RS)\u4e0a97.5%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cModelNet40\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a96.2%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MoST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This means that in order to\neffectively retain new knowledge, it is essential to learn it thoroughly and\nensure sufficient rest so that our brain can memorize without forgetting. The\nmain takeaway from this theory is that learning extensive data at once\nnecessitates sufficient rest before learning the same data again. This aspect\nof human long-term memory retention can be effectively utilized to address the\ncontinual learning of neural networks. Retaining new knowledge for a long\nperiod of time without catastrophic forgetting is the critical problem of\ncontinual learning. Therefore, based on Ebbinghaus' theory, we introduce the\nview-batch model that adjusts the learning schedules to optimize the recall\ninterval between retraining the same samples. The proposed view-batch model\nallows the network to get enough rest to learn extensive knowledge from the\nsame samples with a recall interval of sufficient length. To this end, we\nspecifically present two approaches: 1) a replay method that guarantees the\noptimal recall interval, and 2) a self-supervised learning that acquires\nextensive knowledge from a single training sample at a time. We empirically\nshow that these approaches of our method are aligned with the forgetting curve\ntheory, which can enhance long-term memory.

To\nthis end, we propose Teller, the first streaming audio-driven protrait\nanimation framework with autoregressive motion generation.

This enables the AR\ntranformer to learn real-time, stream-based mappings from audio to motion.\nFurthermore, Teller incorporate ETM to capture finer motion details. This\nmodule ensures the physical consistency of body parts and accessories, such as\nneck muscles and earrings, improving the realism of these movements. Teller is\ndesigned to be efficient, surpassing the inference speed of diffusion-based\nmodels (Hallo 20.93s vs. Teller 0.92s for one second video generation), and\nachieves a real-time streaming performance of up to 25 FPS.

To address these issues, we propose LayTokenLLM,\na simple yet effective method for document understanding. LayTokenLLM\nrepresents layout information as a single token per text segment and uses a\nspecialized positional encoding scheme. It shares position IDs between text and\nlayout tokens, eliminating the need for additional position IDs. This design\nmaintains the model's capacity to learn from text while mitigating long-context\nissues during inference. Furthermore, a novel pre-training objective called\nNext Interleaved Text and Layout Token Prediction (NTLP) is devised to enhance\ncross-modality learning between text and layout tokens.

In this paper, we propose a novel SS-DFER framework that\nsimultaneously incorporates semantic, instance, and text-level information to\ngenerate high-quality pseudo-labels. Specifically, for the unlabeled data,\nconsidering the comprehensive knowledge within the textual descriptions and\ninstance representations, we respectively calculate the similarities between\nthe facial vision features and the corresponding textual and instance features\nto obtain the probabilities at the text- and instance-level. Combining with the\nsemantic-level probability, these three-level probabilities are elaborately\naggregated to gain the final pseudo-labels.

To cope with these dynamics, Lifelong ReID (LReID) has been proposed\nto learn and accumulate knowledge across multiple domains incrementally.\nHowever, LReID models need to be trained on large-scale labeled data for each\nunseen domain, which are typically inaccessible due to privacy and cost\nconcerns. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Continual Few-shot\nReID (CFReID), which requires models to be incrementally trained using few-shot\ndata and tested on all seen domains. Under few-shot conditions, CFREID faces\ntwo core challenges: 1) learning knowledge from few-shot data of unseen domain,\nand 2) avoiding catastrophic forgetting of seen domains. To tackle these two\nchallenges, we propose a Stable Distribution Alignment (SDA) framework from\nfeature distribution perspective. Specifically, our SDA is composed of two\nmodules, i.e., Meta Distribution Alignment (MDA) and Prototype-based Few-shot\nAdaptation (PFA). To support the study of CFReID, we establish an evaluation\nbenchmark for CFReID on five publicly available ReID datasets.

However, there are few studies on 3D indoor\nscene generation with VLMs. This paper considers this task as a planning\nproblem subject to spatial and layout common sense constraints. To solve the\nproblem with a VLM, we propose a new global-local tree search algorithm.\nGlobally, the method places each object sequentially and explores multiple\nplacements during each placement process, where the problem space is\nrepresented as a tree. To reduce the depth of the tree, we decompose the scene\nstructure hierarchically, i.e. room level, region level, floor object level,\nand supported object level. The algorithm independently generates the floor\nobjects in different regions and supported objects placed on different floor\nobjects. Locally, we also decompose the sub-task, the placement of each object,\ninto multiple steps. The algorithm searches the tree of problem space. To\nleverage the VLM model to produce positions of objects, we discretize the\ntop-down view space as a dense grid and fill each cell with diverse emojis to\nmake to cells distinct. We prompt the VLM with the emoji grid and the VLM\nproduces a reasonable location for the object by describing the position with\nthe name of emojis.

Our approach takes features from a single aerial\nimage as input and concatenates them with essential additional conditions, such\nas binary masks and Sobel edge maps, to enable more edge-aware reconstruction.\nBy incorporating a point cloud diffusion model based on Centered denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models (CDPM), we project these concatenated features\nonto the partially denoised point cloud using our camera poses at each\ndiffusion step. The proposed method is able to reconstruct the complete 3D\nbuilding point cloud, including wall information and demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to existing baseline techniques.

Additionally, our work reinforces prior notions in the OOD\ndomain, noting that models with higher ID accuracy performed better across the\nevaluated OOD detection methods.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed\nHummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through\nvisual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4\nbillion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while\npreserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel\ndata processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video\nQuality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and\nvideo data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we\npublicly release the full training code, including data processing and model\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup\ncompared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining\nthe highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the\ngeneration of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of\nexisting U-Net-based methods in long video generation. Notably, the entire\ntraining process requires only four GPUs, yet delivers performance competitive\nwith existing leading methods. Hummingbird presents a practical and efficient\nsolution for T2V generation, combining high performance, scalability, and\nflexibility for real-world applications.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff08T2V\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6Hummingbird\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u548cVQA\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534731\u500d\uff0c\u5728VBench\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u621026\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u97004\u5757GPU\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "Hummingbird\u4e3aT2V\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We leverage VLMs and LLMs to analyze and\ndebias benchmarks from such representation biases. Specifically, we generate\nframe-wise textual descriptions of videos, filter them for specific information\n(e.g. only objects) and leverage them to examine representation biases across\nthree dimensions: 1) concept bias - determining if a specific concept (e.g.,\nobjects) alone suffice for prediction; 2) temporal bias - assessing if temporal\ninformation contributes to prediction; and 3) common sense vs. dataset bias -\nevaluating whether zero-shot reasoning or dataset correlations contribute to\nprediction.

However, existing proactive perturbation\napproaches remain unsatisfactory in several aspects: 1) visual degradation due\nto direct element-wise addition; 2) limited effectiveness against face swapping\nmanipulation; 3) unavoidable reliance on white- and grey-box settings to\ninvolve generative models during training. In this study, we analyze the\nessence of Deepfake face swapping and argue the necessity of protecting source\nidentities rather than target images, and we propose NullSwap, a novel\nproactive defense approach that cloaks source image identities and nullifies\nface swapping under a pure black-box scenario. We design an Identity Extraction\nmodule to obtain facial identity features from the source image, while a\nPerturbation Block is then devised to generate identity-guided perturbations\naccordingly. Meanwhile, a Feature Block extracts shallow-level image features,\nwhich are then fused with the perturbation in the Cloaking Block for image\nreconstruction. Furthermore, to ensure adaptability across different identity\nextractors in face swapping algorithms, we propose Dynamic Loss Weighting to\nadaptively balance identity losses.

We propose a novel framework, the\nObject-Concept-Relation Triad (OCRT), that enables FMs to extract sparse,\nhigh-level concepts and intricate relational structures from raw visual inputs.\nThe key idea is to bind objects in visual scenes and a set of object-centric\nrepresentations through unsupervised decoupling and iterative refinement. To be\nspecific, we project the object-centric representations onto a semantic concept\nspace that the model can readily interpret and estimate their importance to\nfilter out irrelevant elements. Then, a concept-based graph, which has a\nflexible degree, is constructed to incorporate the set of concepts and their\ncorresponding importance, enabling the extraction of high-order factors from\ninformative concepts and facilitating relational reasoning among these\nconcepts.

While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with\nencoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain\nelusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder\nand 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training.\nExisting 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization,\nresulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we\npropose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a\nwell-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two\nmajor challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D\nmodels, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even\nunder distortions.

However, a\nsignificant challenge in resolution generalization, particularly in the widely\nused Diffusion Transformers, lies in the mismatch between the positional\nencodings encountered during testing and those used during training. While\nexisting methods have employed techniques such as interpolation, extrapolation,\nor their combinations, none have fully resolved this issue. In this paper, we\npropose a novel two-dimensional randomized positional encodings (RPE-2D)\nframework that focuses on learning positional order of image patches instead of\nthe specific distances between them, enabling seamless high- and low-resolution\nimage generation without requiring high- and low-resolution image training.\nSpecifically, RPE-2D independently selects positions over a broader range along\nboth the horizontal and vertical axes, ensuring that all position encodings are\ntrained during the inference phase, thus improving resolution generalization.\nAdditionally, we propose a random data augmentation technique to enhance the\nmodeling of position order. To address the issue of image cropping caused by\nthe augmentation, we introduce corresponding micro-conditioning to enable the\nmodel to perceive the specific cropping patterns.

However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach\nthat enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly\nembedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex\nmanual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our\nmethod introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes\n3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while\npreventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises\nthree key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and\nFlow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses\nto compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often\nassociated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS\nensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training\nunder sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS\nsignificantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.

Recent methods\nhave achieved remarkable success by regarding each pair of bi-temporal images\nas separate frames. They employ a shared-weight image encoder to extract\nspatial features and then use a change extractor to capture differences between\nthe two images. However, image feature encoding, being a task-agnostic process,\ncannot attend to changed regions effectively. Furthermore, different change\nextractors designed for various change detection and captioning tasks make it\ndifficult to have a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, Change3D\nregards the bi-temporal images as comprising two frames akin to a tiny video.\nBy integrating learnable perception frames between the bi-temporal images, a\nvideo encoder enables the perception frames to interact with the images\ndirectly and perceive their differences. Therefore, we can get rid of the\nintricate change extractors, providing a unified framework for different change\ndetection and captioning tasks. We verify Change3D on multiple tasks,\nencompassing change detection (including binary change detection, semantic\nchange detection, and building damage assessment) and change captioning, across\neight standard benchmarks. Without bells and whistles, this simple yet\neffective framework can achieve superior performance with an ultra-light video\nmodel comprising only ~6%-13% of the parameters and ~8%-34% of the FLOPs\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, with the advent of large-scale pretrained\nvision-language models such as CLIP, OoDD methods utilizing such multi-modal\nrepresentations through zero-shot and prompt learning strategies have emerged.\nHowever, these methods typically involve either freezing the pretrained weights\nor only partially tuning them, which can be suboptimal for downstream datasets.\nIn this paper, we highlight that multi-modal fine-tuning (MMFT) can achieve\nnotable OoDD performance. Despite some recent works demonstrating the impact of\nfine-tuning methods for OoDD, there remains significant potential for\nperformance improvement. We investigate the limitation of na\\\"ive fine-tuning\nmethods, examining why they fail to fully leverage the pretrained knowledge.\nOur empirical analysis suggests that this issue could stem from the modality\ngap within in-distribution (ID) embeddings. To address this, we propose a\ntraining objective that enhances cross-modal alignment by regularizing the\ndistances between image and text embeddings of ID data.

This computational burden primarily arises from the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video\nresolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality\nor necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are\npre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these\nlow-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading\nperformance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free\nframework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead\nwhile preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high\ndenoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and\nfinal stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To\nmitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution\ntransition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage.\nWe evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where\nextensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to\n3$\\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\\times$ for video generation, all while\nmaintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling\nprocess across multiple evaluation metrics.

Instead of scaling up video foundation models\nthrough expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling\n(TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation\nmodel is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much\ncan it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this\nwork, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching\nproblem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target\nvideo distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time\nverifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching\nprocess. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search\nstrategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step\ndenoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,\nwe further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called\nTree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an\nautoregressive manner.

To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs\n(MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing\nvision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends\nMLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two\nbenchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the\noverall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any\nmodality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG\ncapabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries\ncurated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates\nthe judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from\nthe perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a\nstandardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics.\nOur extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in\nassessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting\nand 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges\nwith MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and\n30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and\nhallucination issues.

To apply this technology to\ndownstream applications under resource-constrained conditions, researchers\nusually fine-tune the pre-trained models based on parameter-efficient tuning\nmethods such as Adapter or Lora. Although these methods can transfer the\nknowledge from the source domain to the target domain, fewer training\nparameters lead to poor fitting ability, and the knowledge from the source\ndomain may lead to the inference process deviating from the target domain. In\nthis paper, we argue that under constrained resources, training a smaller video\ngeneration model from scratch using only million-level samples can outperform\nparameter-efficient tuning on larger models in downstream applications: the\ncore lies in the effective utilization of data and curriculum strategy. Take\nanimated sticker generation (ASG) as a case study, we first construct a\ndiscrete frame generation network for stickers with low frame rates, ensuring\nthat its parameters meet the requirements of model training under constrained\nresources. In order to provide data support for models trained from scratch, we\ncome up with a dual-mask based data utilization strategy, which manages to\nimprove the availability and expand the diversity of limited data. To\nfacilitate convergence under dual-mask situation, we propose a\ndifficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method, which decomposes the sample\nentropy into static and adaptive components so as to obtain samples from easy\nto difficult. The experiment demonstrates that our resource-efficient dual-mask\ntraining framework is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to\nefficient-parameter tuning methods such as I2V-Adapter and SimDA, verifying the\nfeasibility of our method on downstream tasks under constrained resources.

This paper includes model-generated content that\n  may contain offensive or distressing material", "summary": "To mitigate misuse, text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate safety\nfilters to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent\njailbreaking attack methods use LLMs to generate adversarial prompts that\neffectively bypass safety filters while generating sensitive images, revealing\nthe safety vulnerabilities within the T2I model. However, existing LLM-based\nattack methods lack explicit guidance, relying on substantial queries to\nachieve a successful attack, which limits their practicality in real-world\nscenarios. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MJA}, a \\textbf{m}etaphor-based\n\\textbf{j}ailbreaking \\textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming\nto balance the attack effectiveness and query efficiency by generating\nmetaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules:\nan LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt\noptimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based\nadversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching,\nand adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three\nLLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various\nmetaphors and contexts. To enhance the attack efficiency, APO first trains a\nsurrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then\ndesigns an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial\nprompts. Experiments demonstrate that MJA achieves better attack effectiveness\nwhile requiring fewer queries compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our\nadversarial prompts exhibit strong transferability across various open-source\nand commercial T2I models. \\textcolor{red}{This paper includes model-generated\ncontent that may contain offensive or distressing material.}", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u55bb\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MJA\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "MJA\u5305\u542b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08MLAG\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff08APO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u55bb\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMJA\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6297\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MJA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}
