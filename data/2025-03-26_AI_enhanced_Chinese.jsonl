However, despite their remarkable proficiency in generating coherent\ntext, questions linger regarding their ability to perform fine-grained\nlinguistic annotation tasks, such as detecting nouns or verbs, or identifying\nmore complex syntactic structures like clauses in input texts. These tasks\nrequire precise syntactic and semantic understanding of input text, and when\nLLMs underperform on specific linguistic structures, it raises concerns about\ntheir reliability for detailed linguistic analysis and whether their (even\ncorrect) outputs truly reflect an understanding of the inputs. In this paper,\nwe empirically study the performance of recent LLMs on fine-grained linguistic\nannotation tasks.

We observe a higher prevalence of negative\nsentiment in several Nigerian languages compared to lower negativity in\nlanguages like IsiXhosa. Further, emotion co-occurrence analysis demonstrates\nstrong cross-linguistic associations between specific emotion pairs\n(anger-disgust, sadness-fear), suggesting universal psychological connections.\nIntensity distributions show multimodal patterns with significant variations\nbetween language families; Bantu languages display similar yet distinct\nprofiles, while Afroasiatic languages and Nigerian Pidgin demonstrate wider\nintensity ranges.

Moreover, to normalize pose\nvariations and resolve coupled ambiguity between canonical shapes and skinning\nweights, we design a 3D canonicalization process to produce pixel-aligned\ninitial conditions, which helps to reconstruct fine-grained geometric details.\nWe then propose a multi-frame feature aggregation to robustly reduce artifacts\nintroduced in canonicalization and fuse a plausible avatar preserving\nperson-specific identities. Finally, we train the model in an end-to-end\nframework on a large-scale capture dataset, which contains diverse human\nsubjects paired with high-quality 3D scans. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethod generates more authentic reconstruction and animation than\nstate-of-the-arts, and can be directly generalized to inputs from casually\ntaken phone photos.

Moreover, restoring\nheavily distorted information under dense haze requires generative diffusion\nmodels, whose potential in dehazing remains underutilized partly due to their\nlengthy sampling processes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nhazing-dehazing pipeline consisting of a Realistic Hazy Image Generation\nframework (HazeGen) and a Diffusion-based Dehazing framework (DiffDehaze).\nSpecifically, HazeGen harnesses robust generative diffusion priors of\nreal-world hazy images embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.\nBy employing specialized hybrid training and blended sampling strategies,\nHazeGen produces realistic and diverse hazy images as high-quality training\ndata for DiffDehaze. To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns\nassociated with diffusion-based methods, DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated\nFidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the\nTiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp), which can provide a clean and\nfaithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce\ncomplexity and enable effective fidelity guidance.

We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering\npivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal\nprofound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13\nmodels approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a\npersistent obstacle. This work not only exposes the pressing need to advance\nspatial reasoning within VLMs but also establishes a solid platform for future\nexploration.

However, most existing\nGAN-based SR methods typically perform coarse-grained discrimination directly\non images and ignore the semantic information of images, making it challenging\nfor the super resolution networks (SRN) to learn fine-grained and\nsemantic-related texture details. To alleviate this issue, we propose a\nsemantic feature discrimination method, SFD, for perceptual SR. Specifically,\nwe first design a feature discriminator (Feat-D), to discriminate the\npixel-wise middle semantic features from CLIP, aligning the feature\ndistributions of SR images with that of high-quality images. Additionally, we\npropose a text-guided discrimination method (TG-D) by introducing learnable\nprompt pairs (LPP) in an adversarial manner to perform discrimination on the\nmore abstract output feature of CLIP, further enhancing the discriminative\nability of our method. With both Feat-D and TG-D, our SFD can effectively\ndistinguish between the semantic feature distributions of low-quality and\nhigh-quality images, encouraging SRN to generate more realistic and\nsemantic-relevant textures. Furthermore, based on the trained Feat-D and LPP,\nwe propose a novel opinion-unaware no-reference image quality assessment (OU\nNR-IQA) method, SFD-IQA, greatly improving OU NR-IQA performance without any\nadditional targeted training.

To address these issues, we proposed a novel RGB-T road scene\nsemantic segmentation network called Brain-Inspired Multi-Iteration Interaction\nNetwork (BIMII-Net). First, to meet the requirements of accurate texture and\nlocal information extraction in road scenarios like autonomous driving, we\nproposed a deep continuous-coupled neural network (DCCNN) architecture based on\na brain-inspired model. Second, to enhance the interaction and expression\ncapabilities among multi-modal information, we designed a cross explicit\nattention-enhanced fusion module (CEAEF-Module) in the feature fusion stage of\nBIMII-Net to effectively integrate features at different levels.

Experimental\nresults show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\\%-20\\% over the\nLong-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task.

To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context vision modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Existing RoPE lacks effective\ntemporal decay for remote context and fails to extrapolate well to long video\nsequences. Additionally, training on long videos is computationally expensive,\nas vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle these issues,\nwe propose balancing locality and long-range dependency. We introduce FlexRoPE,\nan test-time technique that adds flexible temporal decay to RoPE, enabling\nextrapolation to 16x longer vision contexts. Furthermore, we propose long\nshort-term context modeling, where a high-resolution short-term context window\nensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context\nwindow encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach,\nwe can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length.

Thus, these MAEs primarily learn\nlocal structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing\nto fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI\neffectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that\nenhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1)\ndynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing\nchannels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel\ndependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2)\nmemory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information\nsharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing\nstructurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges\nfine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer\nrepresentations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes\nchannel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches.

In this regard, we present DeClotH, which separately\nreconstructs 3D cloth and human body from a single image. This task remains\nlargely unexplored due to the extreme occlusion between cloth and the human\nbody, making it challenging to infer accurate geometries and textures.\nMoreover, while recent 3D human reconstruction methods have achieved impressive\nresults using text-to-image diffusion models, directly applying such an\napproach to this problem often leads to incorrect guidance, particularly in\nreconstructing 3D cloth. To address these challenges, we propose two core\ndesigns in our framework.

Project page:\n  https://LangBridge.github.io/", "summary": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in Large Vision-Language\nModels (LVLMs), which have achieved human-level performance across various\ncomplex vision-language tasks. Following LLaVA's paradigm, mainstream LVLMs\ntypically employ a shallow MLP for visual-language alignment through a\ntwo-stage training process: pretraining for cross-modal alignment followed by\ninstruction tuning. While this approach has proven effective, the underlying\nmechanisms of how MLPs bridge the modality gap remain poorly understood.\nAlthough some research has explored how LLMs process transformed visual tokens,\nfew studies have investigated the fundamental alignment mechanism. Furthermore,\nthe MLP adapter requires retraining whenever switching LLM backbones. To\naddress these limitations, we first investigate the working principles of MLP\nadapters and discover that they learn to project visual embeddings into\nsubspaces spanned by corresponding text embeddings progressively. Based on this\ninsight, we propose LangBridge, a novel adapter that explicitly maps visual\ntokens to linear combinations of LLM vocabulary embeddings. This innovative\ndesign enables pretraining-free adapter transfer across different LLMs while\nmaintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a LangBridge\nadapter pre-trained on Qwen2-0.5B can be directly applied to larger models such\nas LLaMA3-8B or Qwen2.5-14B while maintaining competitive performance. Overall,\nLangBridge enables interpretable vision-language alignment by grounding visual\nrepresentations in LLM vocab embedding, while its plug-and-play design ensures\nefficient reuse across multiple LLMs with nearly no performance degradation.\nSee our project page at https://LangBridge.github.io/", "AI": {"task": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9002\u914d\u5668LangBridge\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LVLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u6d45\u5c42MLP\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u9002\u914d\u5668\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLangBridge\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u663e\u5f0f\u6620\u5c04\u5230LLM\u8bcd\u6c47\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLangBridge\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "LangBridge\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)\nexcels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained\nvisual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take\nCLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the\nunderlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found\nthat visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation\nenhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge\nfrom generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore\ncritical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We\nfound that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the\ndifficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude\nthat utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective\nstrategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training\nintroduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage\ntraining strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements.\n(3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers\nwith desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method.

Existing methods primarily focus on\neither facial synthesis or near-frontal body generation, with limited ability\nto simultaneously control key factors such as viewpoint, pose, clothing, and\nidentity in a disentangled manner. In this paper, we introduce a new\ndisentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates\nand manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop\nan end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor\ndisentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild\ndata produce unsatisfacotry results, motivating the exploration of virtual\ntry-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe\nthat simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the\nend-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in\ndata forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement\nprocess. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage\nframework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps:\nclothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This\nstructured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages,\nsignificantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for\nin-the-wild scenarios.

In this work, we introduce LoRA-MDM, a lightweight\nframework for motion stylization that generalizes to complex actions while\nmaintaining editability. Our key insight is that adapting the generative prior\nto include the style, while preserving its overall distribution, is more\neffective than modifying each individual motion during generation. Building on\nthis idea, LoRA-MDM learns to adapt the prior to include the reference style\nusing only a few samples. The style can then be used in the context of\ndifferent textual prompts for generation. The low-rank adaptation shifts the\nmotion manifold in a semantically meaningful way, enabling realistic style\ninfusion even for actions not present in the reference samples.

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in\nvideo modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static\nmodalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a\ncomprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in\nvideo understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e.,\nhallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in\n6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on\nhallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model\nreasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition,\ninspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking\nmodel to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning\nfine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT\nenhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the\nthinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the\neffectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on\nhallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

Moreover, we find that text prompts and visual\nprompts are complementary: each one of the two modes fails on many examples\nthat the other one can solve. Our analysis suggests that being able to\nanticipate the most effective prompt modality can lead to a 11% improvement in\nperformance. Motivated by our findings, we propose PromptMatcher, a remarkably\nsimple training-free baseline that combines both text and visual prompts,\nachieving state-of-the-art results outperforming the best text-prompted VLM by\n2.5%, and the top visual-prompted VLM by 3.5% on few-shot prompted semantic\nsegmentation.", "AI": {"task": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\uff08prompting\uff09\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8VLMs\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728MESS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6848\u2014\u2014\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "VLMs\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u843d\u540e\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7ea630%\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff1bPromptMatcher\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0cPromptMatcher\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability,\nhigh computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which\ncompromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable\nAdversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss,\nwhich decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This\ndisruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby\nimpairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the\nneed for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. The method's robust style feature disruption ensures\nhigh transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces\nperturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of\nthe image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without\ncompromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against\nunauthorized use in stylized generation.

Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance\nof the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while\nincurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters.

Translating SAR images into optical images\nis a promising solution to enhance interpretation and support downstream tasks.\nMost existing research focuses on scene-level translation, with limited work on\nobject-level translation due to the scarcity of paired data and the challenge\nof accurately preserving contour and texture details. To address these issues,\nthis study proposes a keypoint-guided diffusion model (KeypointDiff) for\nSAR-to-optical image translation of unpaired aircraft targets. This framework\nintroduces supervision on target class and azimuth angle via keypoints, along\nwith a training strategy for unpaired data. Based on the classifier-free\nguidance diffusion architecture, a class-angle guidance module (CAGM) is\ndesigned to integrate class and angle information into the diffusion generation\nprocess. Furthermore, adversarial loss and consistency loss are employed to\nimprove image fidelity and detail quality, tailored for aircraft targets.\nDuring sampling, aided by a pre-trained keypoint detector, the model eliminates\nthe requirement for manually labeled class and azimuth information, enabling\nautomated SAR-to-optical translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics,\nproviding an efficient and effective solution for object-level SAR-to-optical\ntranslation and downstream tasks.

To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a\nnovel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between\nvideo segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we\nintroduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT\narchitecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its\nrespective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual\ntokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level\ntextual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively\nhandle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip\nthe DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on\nexisting ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which\nconditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments,\nthereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension.

Methods: We segmented the retinal and connective tissues from OCT\nvolumes and their boundary edges were converted into 3D point clouds. To\nclassify the 3D point clouds into four ONH conditions, i.e., H, HM, G, and HMG,\na specialized ensemble network was developed, consisting of an encoder to\ntransform high-dimensional input data into a compressed latent vector, a\ndecoder to reconstruct point clouds from the latent vector, and a classifier to\ncategorize the point clouds into the four ONH conditions. Results: The\nclassification network achieved high accuracy, distinguishing H, HM, G, and HMG\nclasses with a micro-average AUC of 0.92 $\\pm$ 0.03 on an independent test set.\nThe decoder effectively reconstructed point clouds, achieving a Chamfer loss of\n0.013 $\\pm$ 0.002.

The resulting reconstructed surface samples can be\nqueried locally in space, without the use of problem-dependent volumetric\nmeshes or grids. These capabilities enable one to (a) perform probabilistic\ncollision detection locally around the region of interest, (b) perform ray\ncasting without evaluating points not on the ray's trajectory, and (c) perform\nnext-view planning on a per-slice basis. They also improve reconstruction\nquality, by not requiring one to approximate kernel matrix inverses with\ndiagonal matrices as part of intermediate computations.

However,\nhigh-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as\nfreezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and\nmaintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record\ninfrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes\nthroughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly\nscore, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score\non a validation set.

However, their iterative sampling\nprocesses often result in slow inference speeds, limiting their application in\nreal-time tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the latent consistency\nmodel for super-resolution (LCMSR), a novel single-step diffusion approach\ndesigned to enhance both efficiency and visual quality in RSISR tasks. Our\nproposal is structured into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we\npretrain a residual autoencoder to encode the differential information between\nhigh-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) images, transitioning the\ndiffusion process into a latent space to reduce computational costs. The second\nstage focuses on consistency diffusion learning, which aims to learn the\ndistribution of residual encodings in the latent space, conditioned on LR\nimages. The consistency constraint enforces that predictions at any two\ntimesteps along the reverse diffusion trajectory remain consistent, enabling\ndirect mapping from noise to data. As a result, the proposed LCMSR reduces the\niterative steps of traditional diffusion models from 50-1000 or more to just a\nsingle step, significantly improving efficiency.

Since three-dimensional (3-D) images often contain hundreds of\nslices, manual annotation of these anatomical structures is both time-consuming\nand error-prone. We aim to develop and validate a novel approach called\nInterSliceBoost to enable the training of a segmentation model on a partially\nannotated dataset without compromising segmentation performance. The\narchitecture of InterSliceBoost includes two components: an inter-slice\ngenerator and a segmentation model. The generator utilizes residual block-based\nencoders to extract features from adjacent image-mask pairs (IMPs).\nDifferential features are calculated and input into a decoder to generate\ninter-slice IMPs. The segmentation model is trained on partially annotated\ndatasets (e.g., skipping 1, 2, 3, or 7 images) and the generated inter-slice\nIMPs. To validate the performance of InterSliceBoost, we utilized a dataset of\n76 B-mode ultrasound scans acquired on 29 subjects enrolled in an ongoing cLBP\nstudy. InterSliceBoost, trained on only 33% of the image slices, achieved a\nmean Dice coefficient of 80.84% across all six layers on the independent test\nset, with Dice coefficients of 73.48%, 61.11%, 81.87%, 95.74%, 83.52% and\n88.74% for segmenting dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane,\ndeep fat, deep fascial membrane, and muscle. This performance is significantly\nhigher than the conventional model trained on fully annotated images (p<0.05).\nInterSliceBoost can effectively segment the six tissue layers depicted on 3-D\nB-model ultrasound images in settings with partial annotations.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aInterSliceBoost\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6162\u6027\u8170\u75db\uff08cLBP\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e14\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u4e09\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "InterSliceBoost\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u90bb\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801\u5bf9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5dee\u5f02\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801\u5bf9\u3002\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "InterSliceBoost\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752833%\u56fe\u50cf\u5207\u7247\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a80.84%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff08p<0.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "InterSliceBoost\u80fd\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5206\u52723D B\u578b\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u516d\u79cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u3002"}}

To prevent gradient\nexplosion and secure stable training, a two-stage backpropagation strategy was\nimplemented: the first stage propagates the segmentation loss through both the\ngenerator and segmentation model, while the second stage concentrates on\noptimizing the segmentation model alone, thereby refining mask prediction using\nthe generated images. Tested on 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29\nsubjects with six manually labeled tissue layers, GRN+ outperformed all other\nsemi-supervised methods in terms of the Dice coefficient using only 5% labeled\ndata, despite not using unlabeled data for unsupervised training.

We present\nDita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly\ndenoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion\nprocess. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused\nembeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning --\nenabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens\nfrom historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and\nenvironmental nuances.

Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and\nfacilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across\nextensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in\nsimulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to\nenvironmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot\nfinetuning, using only third-person camera inputs.

The advantages of\nthe proposed approach are first demonstrated in simulation: a custom 15-DoF\nrobot hand with one binary tactile sensor per link grasps 17 YCB objects while\nobserved by an RGB-D camera. This low-resolution in-hand tactile sensing\nsignificantly improves object-pose estimates under high occlusion and also high\nvisual noise. We also show these benefits through grasping tests with a\npreliminary real version of our tactile hand, obtaining reasonable\nvisuo-tactile estimates of object pose at approximately 13.3 Hz on average.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e6\u89c9\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u4e2d\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u90e8\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f533D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u7269\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e6\u89c9\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u906e\u6321\u548c\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
