However, strict\nsafety requirements in these domains have limited the adoption of AI, since\naccurate calibration of predicted probabilities and robustness against\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data is necessary.\n  This paper proposes UAC (Uncertainty-Aware Calibration), a novel two-step\nmethod to address these challenges in IMU-based gesture recognition. First, we\npresent an uncertainty-aware gesture network architecture that predicts both\ngesture probabilities and their associated uncertainties from IMU data. This\nuncertainty is then used to calibrate the probabilities of each potential\ngesture. Second, an entropy-weighted expectation of predictions over multiple\nIMU data windows is used to improve accuracy while maintaining correct\ncalibration.\n  Our method is evaluated using three publicly available IMU datasets for\ngesture detection and is compared to three state-of-the-art calibration methods\nfor neural networks: temperature scaling, entropy maximization, and Laplace\napproximation.

Building such a generalizable\nmodel is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset, restricting existing\nimage-based relighting models to a specific scenario (e.g., face or static\nhuman). To address this challenge, we repurpose a pre-trained diffusion model\nas a general image prior and jointly model the human relighting and background\nharmonization in the coarse-to-fine framework. To further enhance the temporal\ncoherence of the relighting, we introduce an unsupervised temporal lighting\nmodel that learns the lighting cycle consistency from many real-world videos\nwithout any ground truth. In inference time, our temporal lighting module is\ncombined with the diffusion models through the spatio-temporal feature blending\nalgorithms without extra training; and we apply a new guided refinement as a\npost-processing to preserve the high-frequency details from the input image.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel\ncooperative inference method for real-time 3D human pose estimation in mobile\nedge computing (MEC) networks. In the proposed method, multiple end devices\nequipped with lightweight inference models employ dual confidence thresholds to\nfilter ambiguous images.

We numerically analyze the performance of the proposed inference\nmethod in terms of the inference accuracy and end-to-end delay and formulate a\njoint optimization problem to derive the optimal confidence thresholds and\ntransmission time for each device, with the objective of minimizing the mean\nper-joint position error (MPJPE) while satisfying the required end-to-end delay\nconstraint. To solve this problem, we demonstrate that minimizing the MPJPE is\nequivalent to maximizing the sum of the inference accuracies for all devices,\ndecompose the problem into manageable subproblems, and present a low-complexity\noptimization algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. The experimental\nresults show that a trade-off exists between the MPJPE and end-to-end delay\ndepending on the confidence thresholds.

To test our\nframework, we recruited 8 participants consisting of 5 native and 3 non-native\nenglish speakers and administered 40 surveys. We evaluated the correctness of\nLLM-generated conversation transcripts, accuracy of survey responses inferred\nby GPT-4o and overall participant experience.\n  Results: Survey responses were successfully extracted by GPT-4o from\nconversation transcripts with an average accuracy of 98% despite transcripts\nexhibiting an average per-line word error rate of 7.7%.

Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport\nmethod that uses $\\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a\nsequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while\nalso preserving the noise properties.

Purpose:This research aims\nto optimize the balance between computational costs and long-range dependency\nmodelling and achieve excellent generalization across lesions with different\ndegrees of severity. Methods:we propose a lightweight U-shape network that\nutilizes Vision Fastformer with Fusion Mechanism (VFFM-UNet).

Font-based text\nwatermarking has emerged as an effective solution to embed information, which\ncould ensure copyright, traceability, and compliance of the generated text\ncontent. Existing font watermarking methods usually neglect essential font\nknowledge, which leads to watermarked fonts of low quality and limited\nembedding capacity. These methods are also vulnerable to real-world\ndistortions, low-resolution fonts, and inaccurate character segmentation. In\nthis paper, we introduce FontGuard, a novel font watermarking model that\nharnesses the capabilities of font models and language-guided contrastive\nlearning. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on the pixel-level\nalteration, FontGuard modifies fonts by altering hidden style features,\nresulting in better font quality upon watermark embedding. We also leverage the\nfont manifold to increase the embedding capacity of our proposed method by\ngenerating substantial font variants closely resembling the original font.\nFurthermore, in the decoder, we employ an image-text contrastive learning to\nreconstruct the embedded bits, which can achieve desirable robustness against\nvarious real-world transmission distortions. FontGuard outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by +5.4%, +7.4%, and +5.8% in decoding accuracy under\nsynthetic, cross-media, and online social network distortions, respectively,\nwhile improving the visual quality by 52.7% in terms of LPIPS.

However, concerns\nexist regarding their potential for bias, which could compromise patient care\nand exacerbate health inequities.

We extracted data on LLM type, bias source, bias manifestation,\naffected attributes, clinical task, evaluation methods, and outcomes. Risk of\nbias was assessed using a modified ROBINS-I tool. Results: Thirty-eight studies\nmet inclusion criteria, revealing pervasive bias across various LLMs and\nclinical applications. Both data-related bias (from biased training data) and\nmodel-related bias (from model training) were significant contributors. Biases\nmanifested as: allocative harm (e.g., differential treatment recommendations);\nrepresentational harm (e.g., stereotypical associations, biased image\ngeneration); and performance disparities (e.g., variable output quality). These\nbiases affected multiple attributes, most frequently race/ethnicity and gender,\nbut also age, disability, and language. Conclusions: Bias in clinical LLMs is a\npervasive and systemic issue, with a potential to lead to misdiagnosis and\ninappropriate treatment, particularly for marginalized patient populations.\nRigorous evaluation of the model is crucial.

Designing the MedVQA system holds profound\nimportance in assisting clinical diagnosis and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.\nBuilding upon this foundation, Hierarchical Medical VQA extends Medical VQA by\norganizing medical questions into a hierarchical structure and making\nlevel-specific predictions to handle fine-grained distinctions. Recently, many\nstudies have proposed hierarchical MedVQA tasks and established datasets,\nHowever, several issues still remain: (1) imperfect hierarchical modeling leads\nto poor differentiation between question levels causing semantic fragmentation\nacross hierarchies. (2) Excessive reliance on implicit learning in\nTransformer-based cross-modal self-attention fusion methods, which obscures\ncrucial local semantic correlations in medical scenarios. To address these\nissues, this study proposes a HiCA-VQA method, including two modules:\nHierarchical Prompting for fine-grained medical questions and Hierarchical\nAnswer Decoders. The hierarchical prompting module pre-aligns hierarchical text\nprompts with image features to guide the model in focusing on specific image\nregions according to question types, while the hierarchical decoder performs\nseparate predictions for questions at different levels to improve accuracy\nacross granularities. The framework also incorporates a cross-attention fusion\nmodule where images serve as queries and text as key-value pairs.

However, their application\nin remote sensing (RS) remains constrained by a fundamental gap: existing\nmodels predominantly handle single or limited modalities, overlooking the\ninherently multi-modal nature of RS observations. Optical, synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR), and multi-spectral data offer complementary insights that\nsignificantly reduce the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in single-source\nanalysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce RingMoE, a unified multi-modal RS\nfoundation model with 14.7 billion parameters, pre-trained on 400 million\nmulti-modal RS images from nine satellites. RingMoE incorporates three key\ninnovations: (1) A hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\ncomprising modal-specialized, collaborative, and shared experts, effectively\nmodeling intra-modal knowledge while capturing cross-modal dependencies to\nmitigate conflicts between modal representations; (2) Physics-informed\nself-supervised learning, explicitly embedding sensor-specific radiometric\ncharacteristics into the pre-training objectives; (3) Dynamic expert pruning,\nenabling adaptive model compression from 14.7B to 1B parameters while\nmaintaining performance, facilitating efficient deployment in Earth observation\napplications. Evaluated across 23 benchmarks spanning six key RS tasks (i.e.,\nclassification, detection, segmentation, tracking, change detection, and depth\nestimation), RingMoE outperforms existing foundation models and sets new SOTAs,\ndemonstrating remarkable adaptability from single-modal to multi-modal\nscenarios.

However, existing DGSS methods often rely\nexclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths.\nVFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g.,\nCLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity.\nDespite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs\nwith attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens\ncomplicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel\nMamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs\nand VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length.

Our approach achieves precise feature locality and\nstrong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and\n71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

However, achieving scale-consistent reconstruction remains an\nopen challenge due to inherent issues in endoscopic videos, such as dynamic\ndeformations and textureless surfaces. Despite recent advances, current methods\neither rely on calibration or instrument priors to estimate scale, or employ\nSfM-like multi-stage pipelines, leading to error accumulation and requiring\noffline optimization. In this paper, we present Endo3R, a unified 3D foundation\nmodel for online scale-consistent reconstruction from monocular surgical video,\nwithout any priors or extra optimization. Our model unifies the tasks by\npredicting globally aligned pointmaps, scale-consistent video depths, and\ncamera parameters without any offline optimization. The core contribution of\nour method is expanding the capability of the recent pairwise reconstruction\nmodel to long-term incremental dynamic reconstruction by an uncertainty-aware\ndual memory mechanism. The mechanism maintains history tokens of both\nshort-term dynamics and long-term spatial consistency. Notably, to tackle the\nhighly dynamic nature of surgical scenes, we measure the uncertainty of tokens\nvia Sampson distance and filter out tokens with high uncertainty. Regarding the\nscarcity of endoscopic datasets with ground-truth depth and camera poses, we\nfurther devise a self-supervised mechanism with a novel dynamics-aware flow\nloss. Abundant experiments on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets demonstrate our\nsuperior performance in zero-shot surgical video depth prediction and camera\npose estimation with online efficiency.

Thus, the robot kidnapping problem can be\nsolved with high precision in every frame, even while the robot is moving.\nFurthermore, we show that our framework with our detector and descriptor\ncombination is able to outperform comparable approaches.", "AI": {"task": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Keypoint Localization Framework (KOALA)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5de5\u4e1a\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u826f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5982\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u5de5\u4e1a\u5730\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6216\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u572875.7%\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.4%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "KOALA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed1\u67b6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Accurate segmentation is crucial in\nradiology, as it aids in the precise localization of abnormalities such as\ntumors, thereby enabling effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and\nmonitoring of disease progression. Specifically, the size, shape, and location\nof tumors can significantly influence clinical decision-making and therapeutic\nstrategies, making accurate segmentation a key component of radiological\nworkflows.

However, real-world\nretrieval systems are often required to implicitly reason whether a document is\nrelevant. For example, when retrieving technical texts or tables, their\nrelevance to the user query may be implied through a particular jargon or\nstructure, rather than explicitly expressed in their content. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by\nleveraging their reasoning skills.

Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can\ncomplement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of\nLLM re-rankers.

Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that\nBonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while\ngenerating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.", "AI": {"task": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u900f\u660e\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u9760AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBonsai\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u3002", "result": "Bonsai\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6709\u4f9d\u636e\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "Bonsai\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8c03\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Many behaviours of interest are\nintroduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to\ninterpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that\nlearns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent\ndirections in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how\nconcepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed\nconcepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that\nthese model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning.\nHowever, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training\nloss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when\nthey really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these\nissues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In\nexperiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the\nstandard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these\ninsights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it\nsubstantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and\nhighly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar\ntechniques.

However, delays in knowledge updates may\ncause them to reason incorrectly or produce harmful results. Knowledge Graphs\n(KGs) provide rich and reliable contextual information for the reasoning\nprocess of LLMs by structurally organizing and connecting a wide range of\nentities and relations. Existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only inject\nKGs' knowledge into prompts in a textual form, ignoring its structural\ninformation. Moreover, they mostly rely on close-source models or open-source\nmodels with large parameters, which poses challenges to high resource\nconsumption. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight and efficient\nPrompt learning-ReasOning Framework for KGQA (LightPROF), which leverages the\nfull potential of LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks in a\nparameter-efficient manner. Specifically, LightPROF follows a\n\"Retrieve-Embed-Reason process\", first accurately, and stably retrieving the\ncorresponding reasoning graph from the KG through retrieval module.

Among phenotyping tasks, distinguishing image\ncomponents is a key prerequisite for characterizing plant growth and\ndevelopment at the organ scale, enabling deeper insights into eco-physiological\nprocesses. However, due to the fine structure of rice organs and complex\nillumination within the canopy, this task remains highly challenging,\nunderscoring the need for a high-quality training dataset. Such datasets are\nscarce, both due to a lack of large, representative collections of rice field\nimages and the time-intensive nature of annotation. To address this gap, we\nestablished the first comprehensive multi-class rice semantic segmentation\ndataset, RiceSEG. We gathered nearly 50,000 high-resolution, ground-based\nimages from five major rice-growing countries (China, Japan, India, the\nPhilippines, and Tanzania), encompassing over 6,000 genotypes across all growth\nstages. From these original images, 3,078 representative samples were selected\nand annotated with six classes (background, green vegetation, senescent\nvegetation, panicle, weeds, and duckweed) to form the RiceSEG dataset. Notably,\nthe sub-dataset from China spans all major genotypes and rice-growing\nenvironments from the northeast to the south.

A natural solution to address label noise would be to\ncombine a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) method with those from DG. Many LNL\nmethods aim to detect distribution shifts in a class's samples, i.e., they\nassume that distribution shifts often correspond to label noise.

A naive solution is to make a similar\nassumption made by many DG methods, where we presume to have domain labels\nduring training, enabling us to isolate the two types of shifts.

However, its\nsignificant computational demands pose challenges for deployment on mobile\ndevices. While mesh-based NeRF solutions have shown potential in achieving\nreal-time rendering on mobile platforms, they often fail to deliver\nhigh-quality reconstructions when rendering practical complex scenes.\nAdditionally, the non-negligible memory overhead caused by pre-computed\nintermediate results complicates their practical application. To overcome these\nchallenges, we present NeRFlex, a resource-aware, high-resolution, real-time\nrendering framework for complex scenes on mobile devices. NeRFlex integrates\nmobile NeRF rendering with multi-NeRF representations that decompose a scene\ninto multiple sub-scenes, each represented by an individual NeRF network.\nCrucially, NeRFlex considers both memory and computation constraints as\nfirst-class citizens and redesigns the reconstruction process accordingly.\nNeRFlex first designs a detail-oriented segmentation module to identify\nsub-scenes with high-frequency details.

In real-world clinical\nscenarios, different sets of magnetic resonance (MR) contrasts are often\nacquired for different subjects/cases, creating challenges for deep learning\nmodels assuming consistent input modalities among all the cases and between\npretrain and finetune. Existing methods struggle to maintain performance when\nthere is an input modality/contrast set mismatch with the pretrained model,\noften resulting in degraded accuracy. We propose an adaptive Vision Transformer\n(AdaViT) framework capable of handling variable set of input modalities for\neach case. We utilize a dynamic tokenizer to encode different input image\nmodalities to tokens and take advantage of the characteristics of the\ntransformer to build attention mechanism across variable length of tokens.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this architecture\neffectively transfers supervised pretrained models to new datasets with\ndifferent input modality/contrast sets, resulting in superior performance on\nzero-shot testing, few-shot finetuning, and backward transferring in brain\ninfarct and brain tumor segmentation tasks.
