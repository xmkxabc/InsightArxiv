Firstly, during inference in videos, objects may\ndisappear since SAM2 relies solely on memory without accounting for object\nmotion information, which limits its long-range object tracking capabilities.\nSecondly, its memory is constructed from fixed past frames, making it\nsusceptible to challenges associated with object disappearance or occlusion,\ndue to potentially inaccurate segmentation results in memory. To address these\nproblems, we present MoSAM, incorporating two key strategies to integrate\nobject motion cues into the model and establish more reliable feature memory.\nFirstly, we propose Motion-Guided Prompting (MGP), which represents the object\nmotion in both sparse and dense manners, then injects them into SAM2 through a\nset of motion-guided prompts. MGP enables the model to adjust its focus towards\nthe direction of motion, thereby enhancing the object tracking capabilities.\nFurthermore, acknowledging that past segmentation results may be inaccurate, we\ndevise a Spatial-Temporal Memory Selection (ST-MS) mechanism that dynamically\nidentifies frames likely to contain accurate segmentation in both pixel- and\nframe-level. By eliminating potentially inaccurate mask predictions from\nmemory, we can leverage more reliable memory features to exploit similar\nregions for improving segmentation results.

To further\nsupport open research and facilitate model development, we provide the\nfollowing resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models --\nLN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA\nOpen Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset:\nLlama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training\ncodebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM."}

This challenge arises primarily\nfrom two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text\ngeneration are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively\nmitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as\nsemantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can\naccurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to\nconsider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This\nphenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate\nwords and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising\nthe semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and\ndiminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm,\ncharacter-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding\nalgorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's\nproperties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's\nproperties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate\nwords in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the\ncharacter level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while\nreducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the\ncandidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of\nsensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet\nsignificantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text,\nparticularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility."}

We analyze the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost,\nshowing that smaller models utilizing post-training quantization offer the best\nbalance for real-world deployment. Our best performing model beats previous\nstate-of-the-art in terms of median vehicle speed estimation error (0.58 km/h\nvs. 0.60 km/h), detection precision (91.02% vs 87.08%) and recall (91.14% vs.\n83.32%) while also being 5.5 times faster."}

To address this limitation, we introduce T-Graph, a\nlightweight, plug-and-play module to enhance camera pose estimation in\nsparse-view settings. T-graph takes paired image features as input and maps\nthem through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It then constructs a fully\nconnected translation graph, where nodes represent cameras and edges encode\ntheir translation relationships. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nmodels as an additional branch in parallel with the original prediction,\nmaintaining efficiency and ease of use. Furthermore, we introduce two pairwise\ntranslation representations, relative-t and pair-t, formulated under different\nlocal coordinate systems. While relative-t captures intuitive spatial\nrelationships, pair-t offers a rotation-disentangled alternative. The two\nrepresentations contribute to enhanced adaptability across diverse application\nscenarios, further improving our module's robustness.

Due to\nthe lack of distribution information about adversarial perturbations in the\npixel domain, it is often unavoidable to damage normal semantics. We turn to\nthe frequency domain perspective, decomposing the image into amplitude spectrum\nand phase spectrum. We find that for both spectra, the damage caused by\nadversarial perturbations tends to increase monotonically with frequency. This\nmeans that we can extract the content and structural information of the\noriginal clean sample from the frequency components that are less damaged.\nMeanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that existing purification methods\nindiscriminately damage all frequency components, leading to excessive damage\nto the image. Therefore, we propose a purification method that can eliminate\nadversarial perturbations while maximizing the preservation of the content and\nstructure of the original image. Specifically, at each time step during the\nreverse process, for the amplitude spectrum, we replace the low-frequency\ncomponents of the estimated image's amplitude spectrum with the corresponding\nparts of the adversarial image.

This dissertation follows the complete\ncreation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept\nto their implementation and deployment. We aim to contribute to research in\nEmbodied AI and autonomous agents, in order to foster future work in this\nfield. We present a detailed analysis of the procedure behind implementing an\nintelligent embodied agent, comprehending a thorough description of the current\nstate-of-the-art in literature, technical explanations of the proposed methods,\nand accurate experimental studies on relevant robotic tasks."}

While achieving optimal accuracy, existing\nCTTA approaches present poor real-world applicability on resource-constrained\nedge devices, due to the substantial memory overhead and energy consumption. In\nthis work, we first introduce a novel paradigm -- on-demand TTA -- which\ntriggers adaptation only when a significant domain shift is detected. Then, we\npresent OD-TTA, an on-demand TTA framework for accurate and efficient\nadaptation on edge devices. OD-TTA comprises three innovative techniques: 1) a\nlightweight domain shift detection mechanism to activate TTA only when it is\nneeded, drastically reducing the overall computation overhead, 2) a source\ndomain selection module that chooses an appropriate source model for\nadaptation, ensuring high and robust accuracy, 3) a decoupled Batch\nNormalization (BN) update scheme to enable memory-efficient adaptation with\nsmall batch sizes. Extensive experiments show that OD-TTA achieves comparable\nand even better performance while reducing the energy and computation overhead\nremarkably, making TTA a practical reality."}

While unmanned ground vehicles\n(UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in\ngreenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor\nplacement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues,\nwe develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D\ncamera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial\nodometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and\nutilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight\nof cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a\nharvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset,\nthe proposed system achieves 94.4\\% counting accuracy and 87.5\\% weight\nestimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For\nthe growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we\nqualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research\ndirections for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our\nfindings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield\nestimation in commercial greenhouses."}

However, autonomous\nnavigation in unknown environments often suffers from scene ambiguity,\nenvironmental disturbances, and dynamic object transformation in camera\nlocalization. To address this problem, inspired by the biological brain\nnavigation mechanism (such as grid cells, place cells, and head direction\ncells), we propose a novel neurobiological camera location method, namely\nNeuroLoc. Firstly, we designed a Hebbian learning module driven by place cells\nto save and replay historical information, aiming to restore the details of\nhistorical representations and solve the issue of scene fuzziness. Secondly, we\nutilized the head direction cell-inspired internal direction learning as\nmulti-head attention embedding to help restore the true orientation in similar\nscenes. Finally, we added a 3D grid center prediction in the pose regression\nmodule to reduce the final wrong prediction. We evaluate the proposed NeuroLoc\non commonly used benchmark indoor and outdoor datasets. The experimental\nresults show that our NeuroLoc can enhance the robustness in complex\nenvironments and improve the performance of pose regression by using only a\nsingle image."}

However, most approaches rely on\nglobal audio representations that fail to capture fine-grained temporal\ncorrespondences with visual frames.

In this work, we propose CAV-MAE Sync\nas a simple yet effective extension of the original CAV-MAE framework for\nself-supervised audio-visual learning. We address three key challenges: First,\nwe tackle the granularity mismatch between modalities by treating audio as a\ntemporal sequence aligned with video frames, rather than using global\nrepresentations. Second, we resolve conflicting optimization goals by\nseparating contrastive and reconstruction objectives through dedicated global\ntokens. Third, we improve spatial localization by introducing learnable\nregister tokens that reduce semantic load on patch tokens. We evaluate the\nproposed approach on AudioSet, VGG Sound, and the ADE20K Sound dataset on\nzero-shot retrieval, classification and localization tasks demonstrating\nstate-of-the-art performance and outperforming more complex architectures."}

We\npresent GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion\nestimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to\nreformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the\noutput motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging\nthe synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global\nmotion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation.
