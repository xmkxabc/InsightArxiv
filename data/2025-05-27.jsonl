Understanding these components and their associated\naffordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is\nfundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part\nsegmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the\nperformance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks\nwithin everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that\ntask-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for\nstate-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,\nwe introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement\nthrough fine-tuning with our dataset.

Notably, our Max-Former\n(63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58%\nimprovement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M).

Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling\narchitecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work\nfocuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities.\nSpecifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures\naffect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we\nfirst point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in\nexisting architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences\nin base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a\nlimited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which\nsuccessfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among\narchitectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of\nstateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit\nsignificant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then,\nthrough a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key\narchitecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess\nfull-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base\ncapabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an\nextremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it\nto a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results\ndemonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and\nsuggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture\nimprovements and novel designs."}

Similarly, medical images in universal lesion\ndetection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing\nattributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage\ntraining images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep\nmodels. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum\nlearning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by\nreweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods\nstill confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is\nimprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there\nexists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified\nhard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch\nsampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely\nunexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We\ndiscover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during\ntraining; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)\nmethod to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS\nintroduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to\nsurpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of\nhigh-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under\nrepresented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented\nsamples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the\nnegative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order\nminibatch sampling design."}

As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima\nwhere it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the\nSLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we\npropose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the\nrationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on\nlearning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates\nnon-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g.,\nsummary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks,\nmaking the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding\niteration.

Several recent studies strive to\nmitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant\nvisual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While\nmost existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our\nstudy reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of\nretained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust\ncriteria in token pruning.

In this\npaper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for\ngenerating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge\nrelated to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a\ngiven text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship\nwith the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background\nknowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and\nwords that share similar features but do not share high associations to the\ntopic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help\ndetermine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on\ntheir knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and\nhigh school student population of native speakers of English.

This challenge arises because\nsubject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the\ntarget and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the\nrepresentation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during\nediting. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles\nKnowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key\ncomponents: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that\ndecomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and\n-unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module\nthat updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the\nunrelated one.

For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox),\nthe Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16\nachieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%.\nFor multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox\nand five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox,\nand healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1\nscores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most\nlightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The\nsecond component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users\nto detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive\nrecommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The\nthird component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health\nauthorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends,\nguiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.\n  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure\nwithin smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public\nhealth management."}

In this\npaper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that\ndynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths\nin latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of\ndynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the\nvertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter\nbranches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer\nlayers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps\nto skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space.

Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which\ncontains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic\nlabels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and\nexhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains.

However, when many tokens are decoded\nsimultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal\ndistributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them.

Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a\nspecific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in\nLVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In\nthis paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the\nvisual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based\non our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three\naspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in\ngenerating meaningful texts.

We\npropose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian\nperspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the\nposterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to\na prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at\nall. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME\ndemonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue\nof LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts."}

It\ncomputes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and\nsentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the\nfinal sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of\ntarget-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate\nthat AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive\nlearning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.\nQualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by\nAmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability\nand robustness."}

To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant\nvisual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models\nthe interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves\nbetween tokens across layers.

Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test\nsets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging\nscenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for\neach test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality\nacross all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor\nsettings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and\ninvestigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To\nfoster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario,\nVTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols,\ngenerated results, and human annotations."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first\nframework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts\na multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text\nrecognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a\nnovel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to\nTIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks.\nFurthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural\nand real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social\nmedia TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on\nthe latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as\nQwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics.\nAdditionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution\nlanguage pairs and datasets.

We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to\nencode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and\npolitically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict\ntarget-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We\nobserve inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a\nstatistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe\npositive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive\ncorrelations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is\nhigher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger\nand more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages.\nWe partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment\nclassification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible\ncounterparts."}

This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be\nimplemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,\nachieves $5-10\\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\\times$\nfor FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality."}

Furthermore, we meticulously\nsummarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs\ninto five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better\ntraining algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks.\nFinally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the\ncommunity might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide\nvaluable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement\ntoward AGI.

This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation\nGenerative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework\ndesigned to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil\nsatellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between\nvegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC\nestimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and\ncorresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on\nboth original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained\non ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation\ncorrection methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an\n$R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the\nReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\\%\nreduction in RMSE, and a 43\\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing\nmethod (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better\ncompared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e.,\nSentinel-2 imagery.

We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for\nmulti-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access\ncontrols encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our\nsystem maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible\nonly to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared\nfragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing\nagents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission\nchecks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints\nand project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views.

Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,\nindividuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation\nfrom a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time\nmulti-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a\nreference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so\nthat, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified\nlinear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional\nfine-tuning?

However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of\nparameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the\nnumber of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the\nold-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and\nphysics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the\nparameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following\nthis opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI),\nwhere model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by\nthe old tasks are protected without being isolated.

Finally, noting that the joint-view reward\nobjective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view\nmetrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV\ndiffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view\nfidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more\nefficient and balanced policy updates.

To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant\nvisual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models\nthe interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves\nbetween tokens across layers.

Based on this idea, we\nempirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge\nrepresentation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased\nneither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct\ncontrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to\ntrain an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three\ntasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning.

One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is\npreference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$\ngiven outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical\nroadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based\noptimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and\nonline), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately\noptimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing\nan analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose\na candidate to elect.

We further investigate the contribution of each\nmodality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one\nby one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional\ninformation beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and\nlanguage regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for\ncross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video\nmodality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the\nvideo and audio modalities.

Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds\nThrough Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed\nto improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We\nfurther extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains\nthe differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that\ndescribes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental\nresults indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations\nwhile reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,\nreasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating\nmulti-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning\ncapabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the\ndevelopment of ALLMs."}

While general-purpose agents perform well on many\nexisting benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage\nwith historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce\nHistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate\nAI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert\ncontributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual\nretrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and\nimages, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or\ncultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and\nmodern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world\nregions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we\nfurther present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully\ndesigned tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding\nin History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of\n27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online\nsearch and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)\nand Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2).

However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve\nsearching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously\nknown values, which requires novel hypotheses that \\emph{extrapolate} beyond\ntraining data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random\nsearch methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial\nstate, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that\nrewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed\nproposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces\nefficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to\nhave a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully\nextrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model\nfrom the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach\nuses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an\nautoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel\nsequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The\nproposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text\nsentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive\nmodel can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional\nbenefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency."}

To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework\nthat enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking\nstrategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two\ncomponents: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking\nstrategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them.

We\ndemonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the\ngeneralization capabilities of Transformers.

This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be\nimplemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,\nachieves $5-10\\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\\times$\nfor FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality."}
