Addressing the challenges faced by existing 3D native\ndiffusion models, such as suboptimal auto-encoder performance, limited\ncontrollability, poor generalization, and inconsistent image-based PBR\ntexturing, MeshGen employs several key innovations to overcome these\nlimitations. We pioneer a render-enhanced point-to-shape auto-encoder that\ncompresses meshes into a compact latent space by designing perceptual\noptimization with ray-based regularization. This ensures that the 3D shapes are\naccurately represented and reconstructed to preserve geometric details within\nthe latent space. To address data scarcity and image-shape misalignment, we\nfurther propose geometric augmentation and generative rendering augmentation\ntechniques, which enhance the model's controllability and generalization\nability, allowing it to perform well even with limited public datasets. For the\ntexture generation, MeshGen employs a reference attention-based multi-view\nControlNet for consistent appearance synthesis. This is further complemented by\nour multi-view PBR decomposer that estimates PBR components and a UV inpainter\nthat fills invisible areas, ensuring a seamless and consistent texture across\nthe 3D mesh. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshGen largely\noutperforms previous methods in both shape and texture generation, setting a\nnew standard for the quality of 3D meshes generated with PBR textures.

To address this gap, we first introduce an\nagent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.\nConcurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII\nbelow), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social\nagents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:\nformat parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable\nconversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion\ncapabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,\nHSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform\nan ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'\nsocial performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new\nstatistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs\nwith COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between\nmeasurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments\ndemonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6HSII\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165COT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51faCOT-complexity\u6307\u6807\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u793e\u4ea4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u548cHSII\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76COT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHSII\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\uff0cCOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HSII\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0cCOT-complexity\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has\nachieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed.\nHowever, 3D Gaussians lack proficiency in defining accurate 3D geometric\nstructures despite their explicit primitive representations. This is due to the\nfact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for\nrendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for\nefficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and\neffective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can\ndirectly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view\nimages.

Nevertheless, most existing\nstudies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the\nvital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore\nthe dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an\nInter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective\nCommunication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of\nlisteners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion\nmechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns\nbetween speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction\nprocess, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively\nintroduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising\nstep size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not\nonly dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also\nrespond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic\ninteraction between the two.

Existing methods are, however, either\nsub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of\ncomputing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation\ntechniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a\n``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error,\nthat allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations.\nThis approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a\nquadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then\nrelaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP\nproblem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative\nsolver (called \\textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and\nits associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After\neach independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three\nVPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that\n\\textbf{GlobustVP} achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness,\nand global optimality compared to previous works.

Current studies focus on the Class\nActivation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to\nidentify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can\nnot learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which\nhinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively\nleverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained\nsegmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of\nintegral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue\naccrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt\nto SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a\nGlobal Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map\nas a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and\nnovel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid\npoints as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground\nmask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt.\nFinally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask\nmatching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is\nviewed as the final localization map.

To address this, our glyph\nencoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between\nlocal-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel\nglyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid\nnetwork to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level.\nThrough these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed\nglyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation\nprocess.

In artificial\nintelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and\nmultimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and\nadaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a\npromising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and\nvideo to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve\ncomprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As\nresearch advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,\nperception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer\nmore coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and\nreinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges\nremain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To\naddress these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of\nmultimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental\nroadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging\ncapabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,\nwhere reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,\nalignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning\ninto multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)\nand multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured\nreasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging\nbenchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the\nconceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),\nwhich aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in\ncomplex, real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u539f\u751f\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08N-LMRMs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMRMs\uff09\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u7efc\u8ff0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765N-LMRMs\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u4ece\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5982Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\uff08MCoT\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u539f\u751f\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08N-LMRMs\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies\ncorrectly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the\ngroup scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the\nimpact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,\ndifferent prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating\nexplanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that\nperformance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.\nHowever, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group\ncomplexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can\nsignificantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,\nwhile adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting\nfor explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research\nshould include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect\non LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios\ndifferently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy.

Existing methods often struggle to\nmaintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features,\nfrequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient\nmulti-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency\nTransfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow\ntrajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity,\npathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k\ndataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical\nanatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By\nreformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr\nsupports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without\nsacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and\nCirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets.

Even if the input videos are\nstable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and\naffect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a\nnovel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal\nstabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from\nexisting learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image\nto align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image\nplanes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable\nbidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation\nand incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens\nand projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in\nvideo stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching\ntrajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal\nwarps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched\nvideos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,\ntrajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that\nsacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and\noptimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode.

Under review at IEEE RA-L", "summary": "Accurate online map matching is fundamental to vehicle navigation and the\nactivation of intelligent driving functions. Current online map matching\nmethods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel\nroad area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition\n(SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with\nmultiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map\nmatching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings\nand scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First,\nthe lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated\nwith the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the\nenriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative\nClosest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability\nfactor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the\nassociation probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving\nscenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability\nfactor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching\non elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our\nmethod through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental\nresults show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map\nmatching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in\nmultilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed\nmethod achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset\nand test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly\noutperforming benchmark methods.

Despite significant advancements in recent years, it\nstill remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for\nnaturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time.\nThis paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The\npaucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive\ncoverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial\nvideo features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and\ncomputationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce\nxTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting\ncontinuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from\nin-the-wild face videos.\n  To address challenge (1), our affect recognition model is trained on the\nlargest facial affect video data set, containing ~450k videos that cover most\nemotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile\nin analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address\nchallenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only\nexplainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with\nlow computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked\nagainst three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox.\nOn an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86\nmean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values.

Our proposed deterministic\nUSAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k,\nDAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ\nalternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines,\nor balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u71b5\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5USAM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3SAM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u71b5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u5076\u7136\u6027\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5USAM\u3002", "result": "USAM\u5728SA-V\u3001MOSE\u3001ADE20k\u3001DAVIS\u548cCOCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "USAM\u4e3aSAM\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Its severity is typically\nevaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation\ncan be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring\nthe region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to\nless consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are\ncurrently available for automated evaluation of this condition from\nbronchoscopy video.\n  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity\nestimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician\nto traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of\nillumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a\n3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is\nused to measure the airway narrowing.\n  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic\nstenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show\nconsistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,\nand reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our\nevaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real\nbronchoscopy procedures data.\n  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis\nseverity using only bronchoscopy.

This vulnerability poses a\nsignificant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect\nobjects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be\nexploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving\nassistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,\n\"manufacturer C\", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors\n(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle\nlighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental\nfactors.

However, most of the current prompt\nlearning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular\nstructures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological\nfeatures) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a\nknowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text\nprompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven\nclinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted\nprompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts\nthrough the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt,\nBiomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention\nre-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of\nnon-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average\nclassification accuracy of 66.14\\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering\n9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\\% in base classes\nand 75.97\\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method\nby 6.20\\%, 3.78\\%, and 8.04\\%, respectively.

Furthermore, our\nresearch shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly\nbeautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic\nresponses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with\nminimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to\ngenerate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum\nSemantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of\n10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image\nmetrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful\nimages with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship\nbetween image features and aesthetics valuation.

This synergistic design enables gradual\nresolution enhancement from 10m to 1m while preserving fine-grained spatial\ntextures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective\ncross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the\nYangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex\nurban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA\nmapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area\nof over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m\nESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an\nF1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by\n9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%.

Mogao integrates a set of key technical\nimprovements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual\nvision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal\nclassifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both\nautoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality\nimage synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly\neffective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To\nfurther unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient\ntraining strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for\njoint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and\ntext-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent\ninterleaved outputs.

Current\napproaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods\nproduce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences,\nwhile video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but\nstruggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel\napproach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths\nof existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through\nvideo diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration\nmodules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive\nevaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsingle-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details\nacross novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering\ncapabilities.

The proposed\nmethod leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic\npulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for\ncontinuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed\nusing a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion\nsignals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the\nestimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory\nphases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image\nvolume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific\nconvolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector\nfields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through\nspatial transformation of the reference volume.

However, the computational efficiency of the model and\nthe treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of\nthis problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on\na nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for\nsegmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\\&E-stained histopathological images.\nFirst, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent\nnucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information\nof the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the\nnucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels\nusing a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation\nresults are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected\ncomponent analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of\nsynergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore,\ndifferent from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus\nboundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its\nboundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using\nan integration mechanism.

However, previous studies have primarily focused on single\nlow-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose\nresponse caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical\nconstraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided\nMulti-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for\nmulti-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and\ndose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose\nconditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency\nWavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate\nhigh-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted\nfeatures are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted\nfusion mechanism to enhance edge details.

Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial\nfeatures and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the\niris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents\na comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages\nof children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset\ncomprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288\npediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A\nmulti-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age\nprediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of\nhow different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly\nthose adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability\ninherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models\nconsistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error\n(MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These\nresults mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible\nfrom children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in\nchild-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal\nbenchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for\ndesigning robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved\nresilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for\nreal-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10\nmilliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their\nsuitability for real-time applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8679\u819c\u548c\u773c\u5468\u56fe\u50cf\u57284\u81f316\u5c81\u513f\u7ae5\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u773c\u5468\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8679\u819c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.33\u5e74\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe83.82%\u3002", "motivation": "\u513f\u7ae5\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u7ec6\u5fae\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6210\u4eba\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u773c\u5468\u548c\u8679\u819c\u533a\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b21,000\u591a\u5f20\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540cCNN\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u773c\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u773c\u5468\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u8679\u819c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee1.33\u5e74\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738783.82%\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e10\u6beb\u79d2/\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u513f\u7ae5\u773c\u5468\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u513f\u7ae5\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
